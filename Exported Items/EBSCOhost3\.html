The authors' conceptualization diverges from the conventional assumption that the ambiguity manifest in the concept of authenticity can be resolved by identifying an essential set of defining attributes or by conceptualizing it as a continuum. Using a semiotic approach, the authors identify a general system of structural relationships and ambiguous classifications that organize the meanings through which authenticity is understood and contested in a given market context. They demonstrate the contextually adaptable nature of this framework by analyzing the authenticity contradictions generated by the cultural tensions between "conscious capitalism"—a market logic that encompasses both global brands and small independent businesses, such as a farm-to-table restaurant or an organic food co-op—and the elitist critique. The Slow Food movement provides a case study for analyzing how consumers, producers, and entrepreneurs who identify with conscious capitalist ideals understand these disauthenticating, elitist associations and the strategies they use to counter them. The authors conclude by discussing implications of the analysis for theories of authenticity and for managing the authenticity challenges facing conscious capitalist brands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: authenticity; brand image; conscious capitalism; ethical consumerism; consumer identity; market logics; semiotics</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers crave authenticity—so much so that their quest for authenticity is considered "one of the cornerstones of contemporary marketing" ([11], p. 21). This has created an enormous challenge for the field, considering that marketing itself is typically considered inherently inauthentic. —[67], p. 1)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the field of marketing, little doubt exits that "authenticity" is highly desired by consumers and thereby is a crucially important strategic resource for marketing management. Consumers are more likely to form stronger emotional attachments to a brand, business, or tourist site they perceive as being authentic ([20]; [30]; [57]; [86]) and to incorporate these market resources into their identities ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref7" title="7">7</a>]; [11]; [45]). On the managerial side, [31], p. 610) conclude that authenticity is "the most rare and coveted asset in the contemporary branding landscape." Their assertion is supported by an array of studies indicating that authenticity is integral to the enhancement of brand equity ([60]), effective brand extensions ([82]), persuasive marketing communications ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref13" title="5">5</a>]), success in relationship marketing ([22]), and emotionally engaging person and celebrity brands ([31]; [87]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although there is a clear consensus that authenticity profoundly matters to both consumers and marketers, the marketing literature also presents a recurrent concern that authenticity is a nebulous concept that has eluded precise definition ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref17" title="5">5</a>]). [67], p. 2) proclaim that this conceptual ambiguity poses a significant barrier to creating "a coherent theory of authenticity." Accordingly, they aim to redress this dilemma by presenting a general definition of authenticity based on six key perceptual components. In contrast, [81], p. 3) proposes that "authenticity is a polysemous and multilayered concept" and thus "it might <em>not</em> [emphasis added] be helpful to compress the wealth of disparate meanings associated with the concept into a single definition."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As Södergren further notes in his meta-analysis, "the majority of the research [on authenticity] has focused on characteristics that distinguish the 'real thing' from the fake" (p. 11). To further elaborate on this conceptual tendency, marketers' efforts to define authenticity almost invariably invoke some variant of genuineness, such as brands (via their management teams) staying true to ideals of timeless tradition, heritage, craftsmanship, and quality (see also [<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref20" title="6">6</a>]; [82]). In this spirit, [55], p. 30) propose that the authenticity of a brand's social media communications hinges on perceptions of honesty, sincerity, and being "real." [<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref23" title="7">7</a>] similarly contend that the core cultural meanings of authenticity are truth, genuineness, and reality. [67] comprehensive definition of authenticity also incorporates a series of veracity-oriented constructs, such as originality (i.e., not being a copy), accuracy (i.e., being true to others), and integrity (i.e., being true to oneself).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the analytic goal of distinguishing the authentic from the inauthentic makes intuitive sense, it is a Sisyphean undertaking that attempts to specify an ambiguous cultural category by referring to other semantic terms whose meanings are also contextually contingent and malleable (i.e., honesty, sincerity, originality, genuineness, and truthfulness). Furthermore, informing marketing managers that their brand lacks authenticity because consumers see it as being unoriginal, insincere, or dishonest offers little guidance on how to resolve the deeper cultural tensions that drive these unfavorable perceptions. Rather than a checklist of definitional attributes, we argue that marketing managers need an analytic approach that can enable them to answer questions such as (<a id="bib1up

					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref29" title="5">5</a>]) as a realization that marketing, as a business practice, also occupies an ambiguous cultural position. On the one hand, marketing aims to advocate for the needs (and voices) of customers ([41]) and, yet, it is also means for companies to enhance their profits and market share. This tension readily gives rise to concerns that short-term (and potentially exploitive) profitability goals might take priority over serving customers' best interests. Accordingly, consumers are inundated with cultural narratives (ranging from journalistic reports about deceptive marketing tactics to portrayals of unscrupulous marketers by entertainment media) that encourage cynicism and distrust toward marketers' branding claims and persuasive communications ([32]; [45]; [66]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, the specific cultural meanings and associations that lead to perceptions of authenticity or inauthenticity vary across brands and markets. For example, consumers are likely to deploy different configurations of meanings, beliefs, and evaluative norms when judging the authenticity of a high-fashion retailer ([23]), a café owner who promotes their establishment as a home-away-from-home ([20]) or a global brand that positions itself as an advocate for environmental justice (e.g., Patagonia; [49]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we explain and demonstrate how the semiotic square ([40]) can be used to systematically analyze such culturally heterogeneous authenticity contradictions and to develop contextually appropriate responses to the specific authenticity challenges that arise in a given market. The semiotic square is an analytic tool that has often been used to delineate cultural meanings and semantic contradictions that are manifest in both consumer perceptions and marketing strategies ([29]; [36]; [50]; [51]; [54]; [68]; [69]). From a semiotic perspective, the cultural categories of the authentic and the inauthentic are not just contrasting or oppositional terms. Rather, they are anchor points in a broader network of relationships through which the authenticity of a given brand, business, brand ambassador, social media influencer, and the like is culturally constructed and potentially contested.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our market context is conscious capitalism, which refers to a "way of thinking about capitalism and business that better reflects where we are in the human journey, the state of our world today, and the innate potential of business to make a positive impact on the world" ([62], p. 273). Conscious capitalism is particularly vulnerable to the broader authenticity–inauthenticity tension that all marketers confront to varying degrees. Therefore, it serves as a very relevant and informative context for our analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conscious capitalism's key premise is that capitalism's societal purpose has, historically, been defined too narrowly (i.e., maximizing shareholder wealth and optimizing consumers' market choices) and, accordingly, its society-enhancing potential remains greatly underutilized. Rather than grafting a social mission onto a traditional profit-maximization model, as per conventional corporate social responsibility approaches, proponents of conscious capitalism contend that businesses should place value-driven goals and social consciousness at the core of their institutional missions ([62]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By aiming to redefine the nature and function of capitalism, conscious capitalism can be analyzed as a market logic that transcends its iconic brands (e.g., Patagonia, Starbucks, TOMS, Whole Foods) or socially conscious businesses (e.g., a cooperatively owned, fair trade, local coffee shop). As discussed by [27], pp. 40–42), a market logic is an integrated network of meanings, values, and norms that provide (<a id="bib1up

Thus, consumers who support this array of brands and enterprises have access to a set of normative principles to guide their purchase choices (e.g., locally sourced materials are preferred over imported ones, plastic product packaging should be avoided); they learn an intricate system of terms and codes (e.g., "postconsumer recycled content," third-party certification labels such as the Rainforest Alliance or Certified Carbon Neutral); and they can express their socially conscious sensibilities through an array of consumption practices—wearing a Patagonia fleece, driving an electric car, shopping at a farmers' market, brandishing a reusable Whole Foods' canvas tote bag, buying fair trade chocolate, or supporting a farm-to-table restaurant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the general public discourse, however, the authenticity of conscious capitalist brands and businesses, and their consumer supporters, is frequently called into question. These authenticity challenges are sufficiently problematic that leading proponents of conscious capitalism feel compelled to address them:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There is a growing network of people building their companies based on the idea that business is about more than making a profit. It's about higher purpose ... and the innate potential of business to make a positive impact on the world.... But one of the most predictable responses we get from people when we mention the idea of conscious capitalism is, "That's an oxymoron!" ([61])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conscious capitalism's authenticity challenges hinge on a cultural tension between the profit-maximizing ethos of capitalism and the ennobling idea that capitalist enterprises can serve higher societal and moral purposes that supersede commercial interests ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref52" title="3">3</a>]; [33]). In this vein, critics often suggest that conscious capitalism deploys the language of sustainability and other socially beneficial goals for the instrumental purpose of catering to higher-income consumers who will pay a premium to imbue their consumption practices with an aura of moral virtue:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, the rise of social enterprises [i.e., conscious capitalist enterprises] has been met with hostility, particularly toward its authenticity and its sustainable impact. If their goods and services continue to be priced as they are, is the sustainable movement only for the demographic that can afford it? ([14])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[70], p. 73) similarly argue that conscious capitalism is more promotional hyperbole than a viable business reality and, further, add this reservation: "It is important to note that the firms associated with the Conscious Capitalism movement are far from a random sample of American businesses: In fact, a great many sell relatively expensive products to relatively affluent, socially- or health-conscious consumers."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This incredulous and, at times, adversarial public response to conscious capitalism has not arisen ex nihilo. Rather, it draws from a cultural narrative that we characterize as the "elitist critique." As historian [34] elaborates, the political charge of elitism has evolved from its classic populist roots, which railed against the undue power wielded by the captains of industry and affluent political insiders, to an antipathy toward the intellectual class (who may not be unduly wealthy or politically powerful). Through this shift, the charge of elitism was distanced from its origins in economic conflicts between the working class and the owners of capital (and their management intermediaries) and became repositioned in a culture war rift whereby "the 'elite' could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate, and <em>highbrow consumer preferences</em>" ([34], emphasis added).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We investigate how the specific authenticity challenges posed by the elitist critique of conscious capitalism are negotiated by consumers and producers in the context of the Slow Food movement ([89]). Slow Food encompasses an array of ideologically aligned brands, enterprises (farm-to-table restaurants, artisan producers, and organic and free-range farmers), consumption practices (e.g., shopping at a farmers' market or a local co-op), and goods and services (e.g., an heirloom tomato, grass-fed beef, a class in fermentation techniques). Slow Food's signature issues and social change goals are grounded in the market logic of conscious capitalism, including local sourcing, fair wages for workers, sustainable modes of production, environmental awareness and habitat protection, and a broader project of redressing societal ills through the coordinated actions of socially conscious businesses and consumers (see [73], [74]). The elitist critique has also become part and parcel of Slow Food's brand image, and it poses salient authenticity challenges for Slow Food's producers, entrepreneurs, and consumers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the following sections, we first discuss the key analytic premises of the semiotic square. Next, we develop a semiotic conceptualization of authenticity that maps out its structural contradictions (and ambiguous classifications). We use this analytic framework to explicate the ways in which the elitist critique gives a particular cultural form to the authenticity contradictions plaguing the market logic of conscious capitalism. We then profile the authenticating strategies that Slow Food advocates (consumers, producers, and restauranteurs) use to counter these disauthenticating elitist associations. We conclude by discussing the implications of this analysis for theories of authenticity and for managing the authenticity challenges facing conscious capitalist enterprises.</p><a id="AN0158338734-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-2" title="The Semiotics of Authenticity">The Semiotics of Authenticity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338734-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-3" title="The Semiotic Square as an Analytic Tool">The Semiotic Square as an Analytic Tool</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a semiotic perspective ([40]), the meaning and categorical boundaries of a given concept are defined through relations to what it is not. For example, the cultural meanings of masculinity have been historically established through contrasts to those that have defined femininity and the related nexus of ever-changing ideals, values, and practices through which this binary contrast has been culturally articulated and transformed over time ([50]). These structural relations give rise to ambiguous categories whose associated cultural meanings can become points of contestation and debate, such as in the cases of "metrosexuals" ([78]), stay-at-home dads ([19]), or the ongoing controversies sparked by the category of transgender athletes ([12]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The binary opposition between authenticity and inauthenticity presents a similar arrangement of contradictions and ambiguous classifications. Consequently, we propose that authenticity is not a set of discrete properties that distinguish the genuine from the fake—but, rather, an ongoing process of managing a network of contingent relationships. In some markets, for some brands and enterprises, these contingencies may be more stable, whereas in others, they may become more culturally contested and, thus, unstable. We suggest that conscious capitalist brands and businesses, owing to the elitist critique, exemplify this latter and more managerially challenging case.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1 presents a semiotic square representation of authenticity. In this article, we use the "contradictions of authenticity" as an integrative term that encompasses the structural relations among the semiotic 3Cs (contrariety, complementarity, and contradictory relations).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. A semiotic model of the authenticity–inauthenticity opposition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The horizontal arrows represent contrariety relations. These relations are roughly analogous to the standard binary oppositions that anchor semantic differential scales. However, relations of contrariety further indicate that the meaning of a term is defined through a relationship to its binary contrast (e.g., good is understood relative to evil). Accordingly, the meaning of authenticity is always contingent on the operative meaning of inauthenticity, and vice versa. We refer to the authentic ↔ inauthentic contrariety as the primary contrariety relation because it represents the dominant tension that, in turn, sets the complementary terms for the secondary contrariety relation (i.e., not inauthentic ↔ not authentic).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The vertical arrows represent complementarity relations. Such conceptual pairings are compatible and noncontradictory (but are not necessarily synonymous or interchangeable). For example, "not inauthentic" is congruent with the dominant term, authentic. However, this classification also harbors other connotations and, thus, ambiguous meanings. For example, imagine a painting created by a famous artist, say Picasso, who at the time was a fledgling beginner, imitating the style of another painter. Because the painting does not evince Picasso's quintessential artistic motifs, its authenticity becomes ambiguous (and debatable)—that is, at what point in his career does a painting by Picasso truly become a "Picasso"? The term "not inauthentic" conveys this type of ambiguity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The diagonal arrows represent contradictory relations. These relations indicate that any entity or action deemed to be authentic (or inauthentic) will harbor some qualities that can be judged as contradicting such an assessment. As an illustration, let us again consider the idea of artistic authenticity. From a conventional standpoint, the authenticity of an artist, even a renowned one, can always be challenged on the grounds that their creations exhibit properties that are derivative of other genres, styles, or artistic predecessors (authentic ↔ not authentic). Conversely, the art world's postmodern movement disavows the idea of artistic originality and, instead, celebrates that all artistic productions are, in some sense, a reworking of something prior. As exemplified by Andy Warhol's replications of iconic cultural images (Coca-Cola bottles, Campbell Soup cans, the face of Marilyn Monroe), postmodern art is also heralded for its capacity to surprise and inspire revelatory aesthetic experiences through its creative (and often ironic) uses of repetition, collage, assemblage, montage, and bricolage (inauthentic ↔ not inauthentic) ([43]).[<a id="bib4up

For purposes of our analysis, the relevant meaning systems are the market logic of conscious capitalism and the elitist critique. This system of semiotic relationships gives rise to four emergent (and ambiguous) classifications, each harboring latent contradictions. In discussing these ambiguous categories, we first illustrate them in more general terms and then address their manifestations in the context of conscious capitalism and the elitist critique.</p><a id="AN0158338734-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-5" title="Authentic + not inauthentic">Authentic + not inauthentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This complementarity relation corresponds to what [39] discuss as indexical authenticity. In this usage, an index refers to a given object or behavior—for example, the actions of a whitewater raft guide, handprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater, a painting, or a branded good. Indexes are classified as authentic when they are believed to possess a factual and spatiotemporal connection to some validating condition. For example, consumers will judge the actions of a whitewater raft guide as authentic if they are believed to reflect an inner passion for the outdoors (rather than being a calculated performance done for remunerative purposes; [<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref69" title="2">2</a>]). Similarly, consumers will typically deem a branded good to be authentic when they believe its design, production, and quality certification has proceeded under the auspices of those who own or manage the brand of note.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As these examples suggest, perceptions of indexical authenticity can be more or less certain. As an example of higher certainty, Prada certifies the genuineness of its handbags by assigning each a unique and traceable serial number that is documented on an authenticity card. On the less certain side, customers have to infer the indexical authenticity of a whitewater raft guide's passion for the outdoors or a retail associate's expressions of friendliness and interpersonal concern. In these cases, consumers' judgements about the authenticity (or inauthenticity) of a marketer's actions (or the actions of other consumers) depend on their inferences about underlying motivations and intent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The elitist critique provides a constellation of culturally shared meanings and rationales that support disconfirming suppositions about the indexical authenticity of conscious capitalist enterprises and their consumer followers. These disauthenticating associations directly correspond to the ambiguous categories emerging from the primary contrariety (authentic ↔ inauthentic), the secondary contrariety (not inauthentic ↔ not authentic), and the complementarity relation of inauthentic ↔ not authentic relations.</p><a id="AN0158338734-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-6" title="Authentic + inauthentic">Authentic + inauthentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification corresponds to seemingly oxymoronic constructions such as authentic reproductions—or, in semiotic vernacular, "iconic authenticity" ([39]). In this usage, the icon is an object that is a known facsimile of an original referent and that is appreciated for its mimetic properties, as in the case of a comedian doing an uncanny impression of a celebrity. For the category of iconic authenticity, the ensuing goal is to present a compelling sense of verisimilitude through a meticulous recreation of the original referents' characteristics. Iconic authenticity is pursued by, among others, members of the cosplay community ([80]) and consumers who perform in historical recreations, such as Civil War reenactments ([17]). In a different market application, iconic authenticity would also be highly relevant to a budget-conscious consumer who wants to buy a convincing counterfeit version of an expensive designer brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When situated in the context of the elitist critique, the "authentic + inauthentic" category assumes less favorable meanings of moral pretentiousness and hypocrisy. In this disauthenticating cultural frame, affluent (and typically left-leaning) consumers use conscious capitalist brands and goods to distinguish themselves from the price-conscious mainstream and their socioeconomic peers who display affluence through more ostentatious lifestyle choices ([24]). By claiming the mantle of moral virtue, such consumers can pursue social distinction in an otherwise orthodox manner—that is, through material displays of refined tastes ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref74" title="9">9</a>]; [44])—while appearing to disavow materialism and status consciousness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For example, during its heyday as a cultural icon, the Toyota Prius inspired oppositional brand communities (Muñiz and O'Guinn 2001) who referred to the vehicle (and its drivers) as "the pious." This epithet suggested that Prius drivers evinced a self-aggrandizing "holier than thou" stance that amplified the moral merits of their automotive preferences relative to those who made different choices ([59]). In a similar cultural vein, [13] note that ecofriendly consumers who purchase organic foods, drive electric luxury cars, and use natural cleaning products typically lead lifestyles that carry a much higher carbon footprint than lower-income consumers who live in smaller housing units, rely on public transport, and seldom fly. Seen in this critical light, such ecoconscious (affluent) consumers are virtue signaling ([24]; [42]; [90]), but their pretense of moral superiority is not warranted by these symbolic acts.</p><a id="AN0158338734-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-7" title="Not inauthentic + not authentic">Not inauthentic + not authentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification highlights that perceptions of genuineness (often taken as the sine qua non of authenticity) are a necessary but not insufficient condition for ascribing this honorific appellation to an object or action. That is, an entity or action may be deemed as genuine (i.e., not fake) but lack the perceived aesthetic or moral virtues needed to be classified as "authentic," or, conversely, to have its authenticity challenged. Thus, we can have marketplace conditions where authenticity, in its full moral and aestheticized sense, is not a relevant cultural category.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate, barring extenuating circumstances, consumers seldom venerate conventional mass-produced goods (e.g., a Big Mac, a Gillette disposable razor) for their authenticity because they lack potent associations with rarefied aesthetic ideals. Conversely, such items are not typically classified as inauthentic either (assuming that they are not knock-off products), with companies often promoting the standardized nature of their branded offerings—and the resulting performance consistency—as value-added benefits.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the context of the elitist critique, the "not inauthentic + not authentic" classification suggests that middle-class consumers who support conscious capitalist brands and enterprises are, owing to their class privileges, inherently "not authentic." This disauthenticating implication hinges not on conscious intent but on the systemic advantages afforded by their relatively privileged socioeconomic position. Rather than being hypocritical per se (i.e., authentic + inauthentic), the implication is that such consumers may genuinely believe that conscious capitalism is a viable means to create a more equitable and just society. However, their genuine belief is an ideological one, steeped in their internalized class interests. Middle-class consumers' ideological affinity for the market logic of conscious capitalism allows them to lead a materially privileged lifestyle in a guilt-free manner ([92]). By purchasing brands and goods that signify a heightened social consciousness (e.g., fair trade coffee; TOMS shoes; organic, locally sourced foods), they can feel symbolically absolved from culpability in the perpetuation of socioeconomic inequalities. Consequently, their habituated class predilections also create an ideological blind spot toward the exclusionary signals that conscious capitalist ideals and values convey to those who lack the economic and cultural resources needed to fully participate in a middle-class lifestyle ([47]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-8" title="Inauthentic + not authentic">Inauthentic + not authentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification suggests that conscious capitalists' products, services, and brands are, to use[66] term, "gimmicks" that always promise more than they can deliver. [21], p. 668) further discuss issues relevant to this classification in their typology of transactions. Among their designations of deceitful transactions (i.e., scams), they list "fraud" and "confidence games." In the former condition, a disingenuous party misrepresents their intentions to an unsuspecting partner; in the latter condition, the scammer actively enrolls their target in the ruse, such as in catfishing and pyramid schemes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The inauthentic + not authentic classification implies a manipulative opportunism whereby an unethical agent feigns genuineness to extract ill-gotten gains from another. In the context of conscious capitalism, this disauthenticating association is most germane to the marketer side of the exchange. As one well-known example, the business ethics journalist Jon Entine accused the pioneering conscious capitalist brand The Body Shop, and its founder Anita Riddick, of fraudulent misrepresentation. According to [25], Riddick stole the brand concept from a local entrepreneur and fabricated an authenticating origin story about traveling the world searching for natural skin care and hair treatments. His exposé further contended that The Body Shop significantly overstated the percentage of profits that it donated to philanthropic causes. Though Riddick formally denied these charges, the authenticity challenges posed by these accusations, as well as others that subsequently followed, continued to plague the brand ([76]). After years of underperformance, relative to the brand's prescandal pinnacle, The Body Shop undertook a revitalizing strategy that its management characterized as an activist revamp ([77]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The "inauthentic + not authentic" classification can also cast more nuanced doubts on the authenticity of conscious capitalist entrepreneurs. Although such conscious capitalist entrepreneurs would not be committing overt acts of fraud (i.e., they are not lying about their business practices per se), the disauthenticating implication is that they are cynically espousing higher-order civic ideals to serve commercial ends, such as charging a premium to their consumers or driving higher stock valuations. This disauthenticating association can arise, for example, when the founder/chief executive of a privately owned conscious capitalist brand sells its rights to a larger corporate entity. Such a backlash arose when Gene Kahn—the founder of Cascadian Farms—sold his business to General Mills. Many leading voices in the organic food community lambasted Kahn's integrity, condemning him as a Boomer sellout and warning that the brand's corporate ownership would not stay true to the higher-order values that originally galvanized the organic food movement (see [75]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-9" title="Research Procedures">Research Procedures</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To investigate how Slow Food advocates negotiate the elitist critique of conscious capitalism and its disauthenticating connotations, we recruited informants from a Slow Food chapter located in a metropolitan area of the Midwestern United States using informational flyers, contacts made at local chapter meetings, and snowballing referrals.

We then pivoted to another level of hermeneutic tacking that entailed iterations between these emic narratives and theoretical concepts, which led us to the application of the semiotic square and our resulting focus on the elitist critique and corresponding strategies for countering the authenticity challenges posed by the cultural contradictions manifest in this market system.</p><a id="AN0158338734-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-10" title="Contextual Background">Contextual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338734-11"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-11" title="The Slow Food Movement">The Slow Food Movement</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As an institutional entity, Slow Food is a transnational organization encompassing 1,500 local chapters plus numerous subsidiary organizations.

This ignominious view of Slow Food finds ready expression in both academic analyses (e.g., Guthman 2007; [56]) as well as journalistic accounts, such as [38], who states that "none of the aggressive, judgmental pitches of the movement have ever been proven. The power of its association with the economic elite has."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From this skeptical standpoint, Slow Food's exalted rhetoric of sustainable diets, biodiversity, and socially conscious eating (see https://<a href="http://www.slowfood.com/about-us/our-philosophy/">www.slowfood.com/about-us/our-philosophy/</a>) is a guise for privileging upper-middle-class tastes over the dietary practices of less affluent (and lower-cultural-capital) consumer segments (see [53]; [56]). Even Slow Food's ardent proponents, such as food writer Annie Levy, concede that a tacit elitism has hindered the cultural diffusion of its core principles:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">—The revered Alice Waters once said, "when we eat food that is fast, cheap, and easy, we digest those very values." What are the judgments contained in this kind of statement? She intends, I believe, to critique the values of a food system that doesn't care about its conditions or effects on people and the environment. But the words suggest that if you eat fast, cheap, and easy you become fast, cheap, and easy—language many women might recognize as shaming. Isn't this how it really sounds to someone who enjoys such food, or is caught in situations in which it might seem the best available option? ([58])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food encourages consumers to shift their culinary tastes away from fast food and industrialized fare (including the oft-demonized category of junk food) ([16]; [83]). Such admonitions can imply a moralistic hectoring and an invidious comparison with those whose food tastes and practices are more orthodox. These elitist associations often cross into other sociocultural spheres, such as the controversy sparked by former First Lady Michelle Obama's school lunch initiative, which was institutionalized through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. By explicitly disavowing fast food and processed foods, the revised school lunch guidelines dovetailed with Slow Food's mobilizing agenda—an alliance that Slow Food USA was eager to promote (see Figure 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

Slow Food advocates frequently argue that fast food is a debased cuisine that deprives humanity of meaningful and rewarding experiences of eating and sociability ([73]; [83]). For the many consumers who have warm memories of enjoyable fast-food meals with friends and family (and maybe look forward to such treats), Slow Food's moralizing pronouncements seem to emanate from an elitist taste bubble that is disconnected from everyday pleasures and real-world practicality. Similarly, Slow Food's veneration of locally sourced ingredients, heirloom vegetables and grains, artisan-crafted foods, and seasonal cuisine also seems to assert an unwarranted claim to moral virtue. Rather than sacrificing for a greater societal good, such rarefied culinary objects seem more attuned to signaling that one possesses the discretionary resources of time and money to treat food and cooking as a self-actualizing identity practice. Accordingly, Slow Food is easily, via the elitist critique, decried as an aggrandized form of cultural snobbery (e.g., [53]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-13" title="Authenticating Strategies in the Slow Food Market">Authenticating Strategies in the Slow Food Market</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 3 represents the correspondences between Slow Food's contextualized authenticity contradictions, the disauthenticating association that ensues from each contradiction, and the strategies through which Slow Food advocates seek to negate these authenticity challenges.

Authenticity contradictions and authenticating strategies in the Slow Food market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our Slow Food consumers place the most emphasis on the reflexive strategy, which they use to counter the authentic + inauthentic contradiction (primary relation of contrariety) and its disauthenticating association of virtue signaling and moral pretentiousness. Rather than rejecting the elitist critique outright, Slow Food advocates interpret it as a warning sign that the Slow Food market has become a gentrified facsimile of the movement's origins in the everyday cuisines of rural Italians (i.e., a disparaging version of iconic authenticity). Accordingly, our participants revere practices that seem to resurrect Slow Food's agrarian values and democratizing goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The humanistic rebel strategy redresses the not inauthentic + not authentic contradiction (secondary relation of contrariety) and its disauthenticating association of social exclusion. In the context of the elitist critique, this contradiction holds that individuals whose lives have been shaped by class privilege may be blithely unaware of their own internalized elitist predispositions. From this standpoint, Slow Food advocates may have a genuine interest in making the world a better place (i.e., they are not consciously "faking it"; rather, they are being "not inauthentic"). However, they are largely oblivious to how their viewpoint on these problems and solutions has been shaped by a life of class privilege and their habituated, middle-class (bourgeoisie) sensibilities. This disauthenticating association renders Slow Food consumers as being somewhat akin to the proverbial fish in water. Rather than not realizing they are wet, however, the analogical implication is that they cannot comprehend that other terrestrial animals lack the requisite resources to enjoy life in the water, as they do.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To negate this authenticity challenge, our participants drew from humanistic rationales, such as the idea that certain kinds of experiences and social connections have magical and transformative qualities that transcend social differences ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref109" title="2">2</a>]). Importantly, this strategy combines a humanistic ethos with the idea of rebelling against a deleterious marketing and cultural status quo and, thereby, creates a distinction to the complicit, part-of-the-problem connotations of liberal elitism (see [92]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perfective strategy corresponds to the inauthentic + not authentic contradiction (relation of complementarity). This strategy is most relevant to those positioned on the entrepreneurial/production side of this market system. It aims to negate the disauthenticating association of commercialism (i.e., conscious capitalist enterprises are profit-seeking marketing ploys). In response, our Slow Food producers and entrepreneurs draw from the bohemian ideal of the artist who refuses to compromise their artistic vision, despite market incentives to "sell out" (i.e., betraying one's artistic integrity in return for financial reward) ([10]; [87]). Accordingly, they present themselves as being intrinsically committed to perfecting their Slow Food craft and pursuing conscious capitalist values and ideals, rather than doing it for the money.</p><a id="AN0158338734-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-14" title="The Reflexive Strategy">The Reflexive Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food advocates use the reflexive strategy to negate the authenticity challenge of moral pretentiousness. The implication is that Slow Food assigns an unwarranted degree of moral virtue to those who have the economic wherewithal to buy rarefied ingredients, spend time on complex meal preparations, and dine at expensive farm-to-table restaurants while casting those who lack such resources as less virtuous consumers. In response, our participants interpret Slow Food's cultural associations with affluent foodies and elite taste practices as a regrettable, but correctible, market distortion of the movement's authentic values and practices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While acknowledging that market upscaling has imbued Slow Food with an elitist aura, our participants reiterate that expensive, epicurean cuisine need not be and, indeed should not be, regarded as the quintessential expressions of Slow Food:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I think one of the things is this perception that if you shop at farmers' markets or at the co-op, it's a lot more expensive. And there is a little bit of this Slow Food bent into cooking elaborate meals, and I think some people perceive that as being elitist because it's sort of this educated way of thinking about food. I don't think of it as being elitist because a lot of times, recipes can be super expensive to buy all the ingredients for, but they don't have to be. I don't think that enjoying your food should be something that is thought of as elitist.... Like, I buy what's not super expensive at the co-op and I cook pretty simply.... What I really like about Slow Food in particular is the aspect of enjoyment and that good food is for all—what good, fair, clean food means for the farm worker to the people who are consuming the food. (Erin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Erin does not summarily dismiss the elitist charge. Rather, she takes a more ambivalent stance by first conceding that Slow Food values and ideals are often enacted in ways that can be read as elitist, such as cooking elaborate meals using expensive ingredients. In her authenticating interpretation, she counters that Slow Food values are better expressed through fundamentally simple meals that do not require extensive preparation time or costly ingredients. Her emphasis on there being many affordable options at her food co-op (which is, of course, a relative judgment) and on "cooking simply" (another relative assessment) convey that she is staying true to Slow Food's core principles rather than trying to place superficial, foodie predilections on a higher moral plane.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Erin further counters this aspect of the elitist critique by incorporating the economic interests of farmers into her inclusive interpretation of Slow Food stakeholders. This interpretation creates a rhetorical contrast between Slow Food's foundational discourse of economic populism (emphasizing fair wages for agricultural workers) ([73]) and the elitist condemnation that higher prices are merely a means for affluent consumers to mark status distinctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Paula's narrative exhibits a similar authenticating logic to that expressed by Erin:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food has often come under fire for being elitist. I don't actually think that's true.... The beginnings of Slow Food were about people eating good food, and those were not necessarily rich people. We are talking about people who might have had very little money.... When most people think about amazing Italian cuisine, they were eating very basic foods. So, the whole idea of eating good food to me doesn't seem elitist at all.... Slow Food in the United States, yes, we do certain things that might be seen as elitist—the restaurant dinners and stuff like that. But again, you are still educating people. You are still getting more people involved. And the more people who know about local farming, sustainable farming, eating seasonally, making sure that farm workers are protected and paid properly, that spreads out. And we do projects with a variety of different populations, and we are trying to do more of that.... Slow Food does a lot of work in all its chapters to help with urban gardens or school gardens.... In the long run, our goal is that all people have access to this kind of food.... We are working toward passing that power on to more people. So, I don't think wanting children and families in need to have high-quality food is elitist. (Paula)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this vignette, Paula first differentiates Slow Food practices from elitist pretentions by invoking its historical connections to rustic Italian foodways. She asserts that Slow Food enjoins a pleasurable, resourceful, and fundamental relationship to food that should be accessible to people from all walks of life, rather than being an exclusive province of affluent consumers. However, Paula also recognizes that her inclusive rendering of Slow Food is contradicted by the realities of socioeconomic stratification. From Paula's viewpoint, Slow Food's community outreach efforts can play a pivotal role in democratizing these forms of culinary cultural capital so that consumers from less privileged backgrounds can acquire the skills and knowledge needed to incorporate Slow Food practices and ideals into their culinary routines.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When utilizing this reflexive strategy, Slow Food advocates routinely assert that cultural capital ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref114" title="9">9</a>]), rather than a lack of economic resources per se, is the primary barrier that keeps consumers from integrating Slow Food ideals and practices into their everyday lives. Christina echoes this rationale when discussing how low-income consumers could enact Slow Food practices if they had more knowledge about utilizing the fresh produce and bulk goods that often go to waste in the local food pantry where she volunteers:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some people who are in Slow Food are foodies. However, it does not cost a lot of money to eat right. There are food pantries who throw away produce because people who come to the pantry don't know what to do with it and they don't take it.... Fresh produce going to waste.... No one wants it because they don't know what to do with it. It's really unfortunate. So, people have more access than they think. There are bulk aisles at grocery stores that you can get food for less money. It is actually a lot less expensive to buy bulk rice or bulk oats or whatever else, than to buy the bagged, boxed stuff that's like creamy preprocessed. I think the real lack of resource is education, not so much money. (Christina)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food advocates often draw an authenticating contrast between foodie-ism—which fetishizes highly aestheticized meals prepared with exotic (and typically expensive) ingredients (see [52])—and the Slow Food ethos of preserving traditional foodways and skills ([75]). This distinction is quite salient to Slow Food chapter leader Kevin. He posits that Slow Food's culinary values and ideals have become misconstrued in their translation to the consumerist, status-conscious culture of the United States. Kevin's goal is to reclaim Slow Food's original ethos from its commercial appropriation by high-end retailers and restaurants:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To buy imported cheese, organic wine, and all these kinds of things, I don't think those are meant to be the most obvious expressions of Slow Food values. And I think this is where the cultural translation from Italy to the United States went wrong, is that it got tied up with those folks [i.e., affluent foodies]. In Italy, it's much more about cooking at home. It's much more about preserving grandma's recipes. It's much more about celebrating the seasons and the tradition and preserving home ways of life than it is about eating in restaurants that do everything right. And you know, like anything else, capitalism wants to subsume this revolution.... That's a schism that I am personally trying to address and maybe lead by example. I don't think we should be cooking like a Michelin-starred restaurant at home. I think we should be cooking like our grandparents and great-grandparents. And I think we can learn a lot from traditional cultures and indigenous people—to the extent that there still are any indigenous people—how to eat well, and you know, a lot of those foods have become an affectation in restaurants. They'll have poutine, but it's made with truffles, and confit duck and elaborate things. I have realized that we are all attracted to the comfort foods and the simple foods, like tacos, and they are easy and fun to make. (Kevin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Kevin, Slow Food should be accessible, basic, fun, and easy—characteristics that diverge from associations with rarity, cosmopolitan sophistication, aesthetic refinement, and technical proficiency that mark elite tastes ([44]). If read in a more critical light, Kevin's narrative reiterates the nostalgic glossing of preindustrial foodways that critics of the Slow Food movement assail for ignoring the harsh realities of scarcity and subsistence endured by those who had to survive on "traditional diets" ([56]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While romanticizing images of a bucolic culinary past have considerable appeal to our Slow Food advocates, the idea of rekindling a premodern utopia is not that central to the reflexive strategy's authenticating function. Rather, these homages to a bygone era, when people lived close to the land and prepared food in traditional ways, symbolically link Slow Food practices to agrarian and/or rural lifestyles far removed from elite pretensions:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I did an internship through Worldwide Working on Organic Farms.... I went to Italy and I milked sheep and goats for a couple of months. And it was very rural. It was very low-tech. We milked in buckets by hand, sheep and goats, and we kind of went out with big sticks and sheepdogs and herded them.... Slow Food originated in Bra, Italy, and that was only like an hour and a half away from the farm. So, I think that's kind of how Marco [the farmer] was involved in Slow Food. He made cheese that was very well regarded, and he went to cheese festivals and stuff. But I mean the whole day was slow. Like wake up kind of late, drink your espresso, milk leisurely, walk the mount, you know. Dinner took a really long time, but that was kind of okay. And just kind of do the same things over and over again. So, we all cooked together. They also did some kind of agro-tourism. They'd have people from the city come out and we would cook with them the food we either grew or found.... That was fun. (Leslie)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Leslie's narrative validates a nexus of Slow Food ideals regarding small-scale production and the slower pace of agrarian life. While this rural setting has some trappings of a staged performance—most notably Marco's side business in agro-tourism—it places Slow Food in a symbolic sphere far removed from the Whole Foods brandscape, expensive farm-to-table restaurants, and other consumption domains invocative of foodie affectations (see [52]). For Leslie, her story of interning on a rustic Italian farm affirms that she has actually lived the conscious capitalist values she endorses through her Slow Food advocacy (and thus is not a hypocritical moralizer). More generally, consumer narratives that link Slow Food practices to traditional modes of food production, down-home family meals, and simpler ways of living—rather than exorbitantly priced gourmet dishes—express a rhetorical parry to the elitist charge of moral pretentiousness.</p><a id="AN0158338734-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-15" title="The Humanistic Rebel Strategy">The Humanistic Rebel Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our Slow Food advocates use the humanistic rebel strategy to redress the authenticity challenge posed by the elitist critique's connotation of social exclusion and the related sociological argument that consumers' social class backgrounds structurally predetermine their taste affinities ([44]). From this critical viewpoint, Slow Food advocates may not consciously intend to be elitists, but their preferences for goods that convey meanings of sustainability, locavorism, and artisanship betray a host of class advantages that distinguish them from consumers whose lives are marked by conditions of necessity ([47]). While Slow Food advocates may be well intentioned (i.e., they are being "not inauthentic"), they are also complicit in a system of institutionalized class-based inequities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate this tension, let us reassess Leslie's preceding vignette in relation to this association with social exclusion (rather than moral pretentiousness). On the one hand, working for room and board on a small, rural farm clearly diverges from conventional notions of status posturing. However, a sociological counterpoint is that Leslie—as a college-educated young adult engaging in an exploratory experience—is building a reservoir of life stories and cultural capital that can afford career and status advantages later in life (see [91]). Seen in this sociological light, Leslie is enacting her class privilege by having the economic and social latitude to intern on a rustic, Italian farm before transitioning into more conventional middle-class occupational pursuits, such as attending graduate school.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a chapter leader, Kevin has oriented his local chapter's activities toward the goal of making Slow Food a more inclusive organization that does not merely cater to the interests of middle-class consumers. When implementing these outreach projects, however, Kevin recognizes that many Slow Food practices are simply incompatible with the situational demands that lower-income consumers have to negotiate on a daily basis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I have amazing privilege,... like being an American to a middle-aged white guy who has very marketable skills.... But I realize that that is a privilege, and this is the biggest thing for us in Slow Food to grapple with—that a single mother who has three jobs and two kids doesn't have the luxury of deciding, "I think I would like to work less and spend more time in my garden".... So, you have to be very careful and sensitive about it. (Kevin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Kevin believes that this class chasm can be bridged if his team of middle-class volunteers presents Slow Food's approach to food provisioning, cooking, and eating in a manner that is "sensitive" (i.e., adapted) to the lifestyle constraints faced by less well-resourced consumers. His optimistic viewpoint is based on the authenticating assumption that Slow Food's experiential and social benefits have an inherent appeal to consumers, regardless of their class position, because they tap into fundamental human desires and needs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The humanistic rebel strategy takes this inclusive rationale further by suggesting that a confluence of technological and commercial forces have locked individuals into an accelerating pace of life. Consequently, experiences of social connection, spontaneity, and everyday small pleasures are sacrificed to demands for efficiency, convenience, and the seductive (and ultimately alienating) effects of social media and digital communications.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Aaron echoes this humanistic rebel mantra in his commentary on the inherent importance of eating and cooking with others:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">You have the social component of Slow Food as cooking and eating together and taking time to reflect and to connect and to develop community. That's something that we lose when we have things like drive-through or microwave dinners, which aren't to be destroyed or demonized altogether. I take advantage of these services of society. But for them to be the baseline means that we are losing what ... enriches our social systems a lot more than people eating alone and interacting through screens.... So, I think food, when it's jointly cooked and eaten, serves as a very natural medium for connection and idea generation and creativity. (Aaron)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Aaron characterizes Slow Food as a needed corrective to societal transformations in the practices of cooking and eating that have resulted in a loss of sociability, communal bonding, and creative interactions. By interpreting Slow Food as a medium for enjoining meaningful social interactions, Aaron expands its cultural province well beyond the predilections of affluent consumers. Aaron's caveat that he has partaken in the conveniences afforded by fast food and microwave meals is another rhetorical means for distancing his Slow Food preferences from elitist connotations. His narrative signals a conscious disavowal of snobbery by acknowledging that there is a legitimate time and place for "fast food." Aaron then specifies the problem as the cultural ubiquity of fast food, which, in turn, he links to dehumanizing consequences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When expressing the humanistic rebel strategy, our participants often couched the communal experiences of preparing or eating food as magical moments that affirm Slow Food's class-transcendent qualities:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I ran a cheese-making class, and that was really fun because I've always been interested in cheese-making, just for the fun of it. There were seven or eight people there. And one of the members still is making cheese today. And it was really fun to be able to share that magic with people. That this is how this cheese actually comes into being, and it's totally doable by yourself at home. So, that's really exciting, that he got so inspired. It's fun to see somebody get really interested in something. (Amanda)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Amanda emphasizes the magic of cheese-making and the inspiration and rewarding personal experiences of self-sufficiency it can enjoin (i.e., "totally doable by yourself at home"). Her narrative expresses a cosmological view of nature as a magical, life-transforming force ([<a id="bib2up

In keeping with this formulation, Amanda interprets the sharing of her Slow Food skills as a means to help others experience these inspiring connections to nature, which, in turn, implies a revelatory contrast to the alienated experiences of industrialized fast food.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie similarly interprets her self-taught Slow Food skills as a means to help people create a sense of communal togetherness and to experience new sensory pleasures and magical connections to the land:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I think of Slow Food as taking your time to respect the ingredients and preparing them from scratch and enjoying food. And that, to me, resonates. And bringing back the social aspect of eating. Like, you take time to prepare this meal, you sit down, you share it with people who care about the same things that you do. And it's also, creating another community of people who value these things whether they're growing, or cooking, or eating; having that kind of common thread, I think is really satisfying. (Maggie)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie venerates Slow Food as being inherently conducive to experiences of sociability and community and as a way to recognize the meaningfulness of food (a normative orientation that reads as a general human value, rather than a class-interested practice). However, Maggie is a meat producer who, like other Slow Food entrepreneurs, faces an additional task of negating contradictions that derive from the "inauthentic + not authentic" category.</p><a id="AN0158338734-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-16" title="The Perfective Strategy">The Perfective Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perfective strategy seeks to negate Slow Food's disauthenticating association with commercialism. This aspect of the elitist critique casts Slow Food producers and entrepreneurs as disingenuous actors who are enrolling consumers into an inauthentic market relationship (akin to a gimmick or a confidence game) to serve their own economic interests. In response, our Slow Food entrepreneurs strive to authenticate their actions by signaling that they would never compromise their Slow Food ideals for the sake of profit, such as by recounting the copious amounts of time and energy they invest into perfecting their Slow Food enterprises</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this spirit, Tom, a farm-to-table restauranteur, views his business as a way to enact his passionate commitment to producing food in a more meaningful and socially beneficial way:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When you go to a fast-food restaurant, you have no idea of who actually made that food and the process of where it came from is not known to you. The taste and flavor are mostly engineered to play off the cheap sensory sensations. So, it's fatty and salty and sweet and so, yeah, on a certain level, it might be gratifying, but it's a cheap way to do it that is less meaningful. Slow Food is like, "We're going to do things in a way that is process oriented!" I talk about process a lot.... We [Tom and his restaurant staff] were really structured around learning, and so it was a process where we feel like we've excelled and learned a lot and we'll keep pursuing that.... [With Slow Food,] you have this process where people are eating and making something and understanding where it came from and how it works. Eating is such an important part of our lives, and it can have a really important impact on our community and environment. So, the more you understand about it, hopefully you'll make better decisions. The basic motto of Slow Food is clean, fair, and good food. I can totally get behind those values. (Tom)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During his interview, Tom extensively discussed "the process" aspects of his restaurant and how he views it less as a business than a means to cultivate and diffuse knowledge about the complex interrelationships among food, cooking, sensory enjoyment, ecology, and societal well-being. His quote also reiterates Slow Food's argument that the experiences of these simple culinary pleasures can mobilize consumers to resist the industrialization of the food system (thus echoing the humanistic rebel strategy). For Slow Food entrepreneurs, however, it serves the additional function of associating their enterprises with civic goals that stand distinct from conventional commercial aims.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Returning to Maggie, she raises pasture-fed rabbits for sale to farm-to-table restaurants and consumers. In developing her production techniques, Maggie has constantly experimented with different procedures and equipment designs. Through this long trial-and-error process, Maggie believes she has developed an innovative method that better simulates the lives her rabbits would enjoy outside of captivity:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie: Daniel Salatin is the son of Joel Salatin, who is the owner of Polyface Farms, and he is the person who is raising rabbits in this system that he has devised and calls the Hare Pen system. So essentially, you still have your does in cages.... You put them in a glorified cage that you then put on grass.... I've copied their system exactly, and I was very unsatisfied with the results that I got. [Maggie then provides an extensive description of her alternative and labor-intensive system and how she developed it]... I don't know why I kept doing it. But I finally have a system that is really effective.... It just was a lot of observation of the rabbits on pasture, making so many mistakes and then incorporating what I had learned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interviewer: Did you have any economic incentives?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie: No! It has to be a personal belief that there might be a better way to do things.... It's kind of like what makes an artist a good artist. If they all hold the brush the same way and they are using the same colors, but they create vastly different things, and one appeals to you, and one doesn't appeal to you. So, what makes that one piece of art recognized by the vast majority of people as superior?... I have this wonderful platform to invest energy and creativity, and it's nice. And so, I feel in some ways really lucky.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Invoking the image of the passionate artist, Maggie distinguishes her efforts to perfect an ecologically appropriate system for raising rabbits from crass commercial and economic interests. Maggie's closing sentiment expresses her authenticating belief that such actions can make things better, rather than being driven by instrumental aims. Through storytelling, and by showing how her system works to customers who visit her farm, Maggie deploys narrative and material resources to negate disauthenticating concerns that her Slow Food affinities are merely an instrumental means to charge higher prices. Her personal investment in learning about rabbits' natural habitats/behaviors and inventing a complex ecosystem for raising them further signals that she is not likely to compromise her Slow Food principles in the interest of commercial expediency.</p><a id="AN0158338734-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-17" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338734-18"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-18" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has treated authenticity as a perceptual value or quality that consumers attribute to a brand ([11]; [55]), person-brand ([87]), product ([57]), or performance ([<a id="bib5up

In contrast, we have reconceptualized authenticity as an ongoing process through which consumers and marketers negotiate a contextualized system of cultural contradictions and ambiguous classifications. We suggest that our semiotic framework can better analyze the authenticity contestations that arise in a given market or sociocultural context than conventional theories that assume authenticity perceptions operate on a continuum or selectively draw from an essential set of defining attributes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The conceptualization of authenticity as a relative point along an authentic-to-inauthentic continuum ([22]; [65]) can depict a zone of ambiguity where the authenticity or inauthenticity of a market actor is perceived as being uncertain and, thus, debatable. However, this conceptualization does not offer a means to specifically analyze the cultural meanings (and the interrelationships among them) that generate these ambiguous perceptions. Accordingly, it offers limited theoretical discrimination and managerial guidance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For example, [65] argue that quality commitment, heritage, and sincerity are the primary perceptual cues of authenticity. They then propose that brands should differentially leverage these cues depending on whether consumers perceive them as having low, moderate, or high levels of authenticity. In their normative framework, brands with low perceived authenticity should emphasize sincerity, brands with moderate perceived authenticity should emphasize quality and heritage, and brands with a high level of perceived authenticity should emphasize all three authenticity cues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Such recommendations presume that brands falling into the lower and middle sectors of this proposed continuum have a shortfall of perceived quality commitment, sincerity, or heritage that is rectifiable through compensatory signaling. However, such contested brands are often plagued by contradictory meanings that undermine their promoted claims to authenticity ([37]; [86]). Furthermore, more complex, disauthenticating narratives, such as the elitist critique, can cast doubt on the very credibility of such authenticating cues when used by a contested brand or actors in a market system.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Turning to combinatory definitions, [67] have offered a comprehensive theorization of authenticity (as understood from the consumer's perspective) that warrants comparison to our approach. They identify six subdimensions of authenticity (accuracy, connectedness, integrity, legitimacy, originality, and proficiency) and then trace out the relative impact of those dimensions across different market categories and on consumers' behavioral intentions. Rather than a continuum, Nunes, Ordanini, and Giambastiani argue for a family resemblance explanation in which "a concept (authenticity, in this case) may be qualified by different subsets of its dimensions across different contexts, and not always by all of them in the same way" (p. 16).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Like a continuum, [67] family resemblance logic is limited to the explanation that authenticity is a multidimensional construct whose subcomponents may be more or less important in a given market or consumption context. In contrast, a semiotic framework shifts attention from correlational premises (e.g., this authenticity subdimension seems more important for hedonic products than utilitarian ones) to the cultural meanings, and underlying structural contradictions, relevant to a particular judgment regarding the authenticity of a given product, brand, or market action. For example, the authentic ↔ inauthentic tension elevates the importance of authenticity's moral dimensions in ways that traverse product category distinctions, such as hedonic or utilitarian.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate, a hamburger would typically be classified as a hedonic good. [67], pp. 3–4) find that judgments of "legitimacy"—which they define as "the extent to which a product or service adheres to shared norms, standards, rules, or traditions present in the market ... appear to matter for utilitarian but not hedonic products." However, if we examine this consumer choice in the context of the Slow Food market, then legitimacy becomes a far more important issue. From this standpoint, an "authentic burger" would need to exhibit fidelity to various aesthetic and moral norms—grass-fed beef, local sourcing, traditional preparation techniques, and so on—and, its perceived authenticity would be understood and legitimated through a contrast to fast-food burgers. That authenticating contrast (the fast-food burger vs. a Slow Food burger) could then become subject to the elitist critique, which, in turn, would provide motivation for Slow Food advocates to negate these disauthenticating associations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, we have argued that authenticity is culturally constructed (and contested) in a network of structural relations (rather than being a discrete set of essential properties attributed to a brand, person-brand, market performance, or market relationship). Consumers and marketers alike covet indexical authenticity (i.e., the abstract ideal of authenticity) because it can confer cultural legitimacy ([51]), moral authority ([59]), and identity validation ([<a id="bib7up

However, this authenticity ideal is structurally linked to contradictory meanings and ambiguous classifications. When consumers' or marketers' authenticity claims are challenged by these cultural contradictions, they have pressing incentives to distinguish their actions and identities from the invoked disauthenticating associations. In the following subsection, we discuss how this authenticating goal can be enacted by negating associations that flow along the contradictory path of deception and promoting those that follow the contradictory path of redemption.</p><a id="AN0158338734-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-19" title="Two Managerial Paths to Authenticating a Brand">Two Managerial Paths to Authenticating a Brand</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As [49] have argued, marketing managers often find it difficult to redress brand image problems because they are unable to effectively decipher the cultural meanings contributing to those dilemmas. Our semiotic framework can help redress this managerial shortfall. It offers a tangible means for marketing managers to systematically analyze the cultural contradictions of authenticity that emerge in a given market and then to identify strategies for authenticating their brands in the face of these challenges.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a general heuristic, we propose that marketers can be successful in authenticating their brands and/or other strategic assets when they are able to accomplish two complementary goals. The first is to leverage cultural meanings that negate the disauthenticating associations that flow along the contradictory of deception path (authentic → not authentic; see Figure 1). When consumers follow this perceptual path, they experience a glaring contradiction between a prevailing ideal of authenticity and its market manifestation in a brand or marketing practice (authentic ↔ not authentic), which then leads to an association of inauthenticity via the complementary relation of not authentic → inauthentic. In response, marketers should try to provide consumers with compelling and emotionally resonant meanings and rationales that discount the credibility, relevance, or importance of the disauthenticating associations that have gained cultural currency in their respective market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As one illustration, Patagonia confronted a path of deception authenticity challenge soon after it began campaigning against the Trump administration's executive order to reduce the size of Utah's Bears Ears National Monument by two million acres. On December 4, 2017, Patagonia featured this message on the front page of its website: "The President Stole Your Land: In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history." This web page then directed consumers to various information sources and encouraged consumers to contact their elected officials and to also take the protest to social media, using the hashtag #MonumentalMistakes (see [<a id="bib1up

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke condemned Patagonia as a dishonest "special interest" and proclaimed it was "shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to put money in their coffers." Utah Representative Bob Bishop, then chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, also evoked the elitist critique in his tweet proclaiming that "Patagonia is Lying to You... A corporate giant hijacking our public lands debate to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco" (quoted in [35]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of our model, the Trump administration's response challenged the authenticity of Patagonia's mobilizing campaign by impugning its motivations, thereby reframing an ostensibly authentic (conscious capitalist) action as a disingenuous public relations stunt designed to extract more profits from elite consumers (authentic → inauthentic), which, in turn, triggers the complementary association to inauthenticity. In response, Patagonia joined as a coplaintiff with five Native American tribes and several nonprofit groups in a lawsuit aiming to halt the policy change ([35]; see also https://<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/stories/hey-hows-that-lawsuit-against-the-president-going/story-72248.html">www.patagonia.com/stories/hey-hows-that-lawsuit-against-the-president-going/story-72248.html</a>). Patagonia also continued to be a vocal critic of the Trump administration's environmental policies and, in a politically and ideologically related vein, donated all its tax savings from the Trump-backed corporate tax cut to environmental groups while condemning the new corporate tax rates as being irresponsible ([63]). Through these responses, Patagonia signaled a deeper commitment to its conscious capitalist values and gave consumers reasons to doubt or dismiss the disauthenticating associations of greed and deception that were being cast on it. In response to Patagonia's uncompromising stance, <em>Inc</em>. offered the following commentary on its 2018 Company of the Year finalist:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Patagonia and its fans, that purpose is doing whatever they can to try to save the planet. In 2018, Patagonia proved that it will not only preach that mission, it will do so with a much louder voice than most other companies. And—so far, anyway—it's only further burnished the Patagonia brand. ([<a id="bib8up

This redemptive chain of associations begins with the widespread cultural view of marketers as inauthentic and, thus, untrustworthy actors ([45]; [66]; [67]). Accordingly, we can assume that consumers will typically harbor varying degrees of skepticism and suspicion toward the authenticity of marketing and branding claims. Redemptive meanings encourage consumers to believe that a given brand or business is operating in ways that favorably diverge from the marketing status quo (i.e., not inauthentic) which, in turn, leads to the complementary relation of not inauthentic → authentic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Volkswagen's (VW's) "Hello Light" advertisement, which launched its new line of electric vehicles (circa 2019), takes viewers on a journey that follows a path of redemption arc (see https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEvNL6oEr0U">www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEvNL6oEr0U</a>). The ad begins with a silhouetted figure entering a dark and seemingly abandoned production facility, while a news report about VW's emission scandal, or "Dieselgate," blares in the background. In a seemingly counterproductive marketing communications move, the ad explicitly reminds its viewers of all the inauthentic associations (VW as liar, deceiver) that arose from those "dark" days. The protagonist is revealed to be a despondent engineer struggling to design a new VW model, against the musical backdrop of Simon and Garfunkel's 1960s anthem, "The Sound of Silence." Desperate for inspiration, our engineer scours the company archives and finds his creative muse—an image of the iconic VW Van (aka the "Love Bus").</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Through the choice of song and reference to this totem of the 1960s counterculture, the ad recalls VW's countercultural legacy as an authentic symbol of antimaterialist values and a rebuke to status consciousness and marketing hype ([46]). The ad's message is that VW, despite having lost its way, still possesses a latent essential "goodness" that is "not inauthentic." As "The Sound of Silence" reaches its crescendo, lights go on, puncturing the darkness. We observe the production facility come to life and give metaphorical rebirth to the VW brand in the form of an electric van (which also places "The Sound of Silence" on a different, ecofriendly cultural register). Thus, the ad's narrative follows the redemptive path of "inauthentic" (VW's Dieselgate) to "not inauthentic" (VW's 1960's countercultural heyday) to "authentic" (signifying that VW has rekindled its socially conscious roots).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our discussion of the three authenticating strategies used by Slow Food consumers and entrepreneurs has emphasized their function as a defensive means to disavow or negate the disauthenticating associations that flow along the contradictory of deception path. However, these same strategies also promote affirmative meanings and associations that operate along the contradictory of redemption path. For example, the perfective strategy does more than negate the disauthenticating association with commercialism. It also magnifies authenticating differences to fast food or industrialized food production and thereby encourages consumers to interpret Slow Food enterprises in a manner compatible with the contradictory of redemption path (even though they may be aware of some disauthenticating associations). This redemptive associative chain takes the following form: Slow Food entrepreneurs are suspected to be "inauthentic" due to their commercial motivations → Slow Food entrepreneurs are seen as being "not inauthentic" because their deep commitment to artisan ideals and noncommercial values differentiates them from conventional fast-food establishments and industrialized modes of commercial food production → the signification of "not inauthentic" supports a broader conclusion that the Slow Food entrepreneur is an authentic actor.</p><a id="AN0158338734-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-20" title="Implications for Managers of Conscious Capitalist Brands">Implications for Managers of Conscious Capitalist Brands</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given their shared ideological affinities, the authenticating strategies used by Slow Food advocates should also have a high degree of applicability to brands espousing conscious capitalist goals and ideals. Of the three authenticating strategies, we find numerous examples of conscious capitalist brands that have enacted some version of the perfective strategy, which aims to negate associations with commercial opportunism and foster interpretations compatible with the contradictory of redemption path. While less commonplace, we can also find branding campaigns that align with the reflexive and humanistic rebel strategies. In the following discussion, we use these various exemplars to illustrate how these authenticating strategies can be implemented by conscious capitalist brands and the authenticity contradictions they potentially redress.</p><a id="AN0158338734-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-21" title="Perfective strategy">Perfective strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brands using the perfective strategy engage in unconventional actions that demonstrate a deep commitment to activist causes that supersede profit motives. Over the years, Patagonia has made frequent use of this authenticating strategy to signal that proenvironmental values were central to its corporate mission, even when such acts could mean sacrificing sales, such as its iconic "Don't Buy" promotion ([49]) or their "Give a Damn" holiday messaging ([72]). REI has also enacted a perfective strategy in its #OptOutside campaign, whereby the retailer closes its stores on Black Friday and encourages consumers to engage in a range of proenvironmental, outdoor activities. Like Patagonia, REI's campaign builds on (and authenticates) the brand's history of supporting environmental causes and promoting a heightened concern for habitat protection and environmental conservation. Last but not least, Clif Bar illustrated a fairly novel implementation of the perfective strategy when its founder and chief executive officer, Gary Erickson, published an "advertorial" in the <em>New York Times</em>, offering to donate ten tons of organic ingredients to his main competitor Kind Bars. This advertorial further promised to share his company's knowledge about organic sourcing and production so that the two companies could collectively "lay the foundation for a healthier, more just and sustainable food system" ([26]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Owing to their status as commercial enterprises, whose existence depends on profitability, the perfective strategies of conscious capitalist brands can always be reframed as yet another kind of commercial deception. However, such brands can lessen the cultural viability of such recursive challenges by further signaling that their passionate commitment to the supported causes takes precedence over profit motives. Though addressing a different context, [20] offer evidence that supports this strategic approach. They find that customers attribute the quality of authenticity to third-place establishments (e.g., cafes, coffee shops, restaurants) when they believe the respective proprietors are aiming to create meaningful social connections rather than merely trying to make a profit. As they write, "The authenticity perceived in treasured commercial places is based on exchanges that go beyond mere commercial aspects.... Although being business operators, proprietors invite the consumer to engage in activities that are not undertaken purely for profit" ([20], p. 913).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Accordingly, we propose that conscious capitalist brands are more likely to be perceived as authentic when they provide tangible means for consumers to participate in their social change mission but do so in ways that are not dependent on purchases. From this standpoint, The Body Shop's repositioning of its stores as activist hubs ([77])—where consumers can listen to speakers discuss environmental and social justice issues, sign petitions, and join activist organizations—is an enactment of the perfective strategy and a culturally viable means to reestablish the authenticity of its conscious capitalist branding claims.</p><a id="AN0158338734-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-22" title="Reflexive strategy">Reflexive strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This strategy aims to negate the charge that a market actor is evincing a "holier than thou" stance for actions that are either hypocritical (e.g., "do as I say, not as I do") or overstate the positive impact of the self-proclaimed act of conscious capitalist rectitude. For conscious capitalist brands, this authenticating logic most readily translates into a reformist agenda. As one prominent example, Chipotle's "Back to the Start" campaign (circa 2012) rallied a diverse assemblage of activist groups that shared a commitment to transforming the corporate-controlled system of food production and who saw the fast-food sector as exemplifying its presumed ills (see [48]). The two-minute short film, which ran across multiple media platforms, shows an increasingly disenchanted farmer witnessing the steady industrialization of his enterprise, replete with enclosed animals, the heavy use of antibiotics, and food being transformed into nondescript goo-like substances. Against the backdrop of Willie Nelson's plaintive version of Coldplay's "The Scientist," the farmer triumphantly decides to go "back to the start" by raising free-range animals, using traditional farming techniques, and selling his preindustrial goods to Chipotle.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some relevant insights into this campaign and its authenticating effects can be gleaned from a <em>Fast Company</em> interview with Jesse Coulter, co–chief creative officer of Creative Artists Agency Marketing, which worked with Chipotle's management team in developing this campaign:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We were tasked to find new ways to tell Chipotle's Food with Integrity story.... The first issue Chipotle wanted to address was industrial farming.... Chipotle shared many stories of family farmers who have turned their farms into factory farms and have subsequently grown to regret it.... It was provocative because it took a stab at Big Agriculture. Chipotle is a bold company, who has the courage to really stand up for what they believe in.... At the end of the film, a title card appears letting people know that they can download the song on iTunes, and the proceeds benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation, which is dedicated to creating a sustainable, healthy, and equitable food future. People responded and the song reached number one on the iTunes Country chart. ([15])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When interpreted through the lens of the reflexive strategy, Chipotle's "bold" move was to accept and amplify activist groups' criticisms of the fast-food industry's sourcing and production practices, rather than attempting to deny, rationalize, or obscure these problems through conventional images of consumers enjoying their fast-food meals. The campaign thereby draws an ideological distinction between Chipotle (as a reformist enterprise returning to more humane and sustainable agricultural practices) and the broader fast-food industry that is portrayed as having debased the time-honored practice of farming in the name of speed, efficiency, and cost reduction. In this way, Chipotle aligned itself not with the interests of the fast-food industry at large, but with activist groups who are seeking to reform the broader system of industrialized food production. Chipotle further reinforced the credibility of their reflexive strategy by investing additional resources to support the broader cause (i.e., creating a synergy between the reflexive and the perfective strategy).</p><a id="AN0158338734-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-23" title="Humanistic rebel strategy">Humanistic rebel strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This strategy promotes the brand as a means for reconstituting meaningful social connections and breaking down societal boundaries that artificially separate people.

The intended message is that the conscious capitalist brand is enabling consumers to resist or escape the dehumanizing and/or isolating influences of materialism, status consciousness, and upward-ratcheting lifestyle competitions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">IKEA has run numerous campaigns that align with the humanistic rebel strategy. These campaigns embed its conscious capitalist commitments to sustainability and support of social justice issues, such as gender equity and LGBTQ rights, in a home-as-haven brand narrative. In these ads, the IKEA-furnished home represents a therapeutic space where people can, at least temporarily, unplug from the stresses and distractions of the "networked life" ([88], p. 17) and experience meaningful human connections and emotional fulfillment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More than just a haven, however, IKEA often portrays the home as an active force that keeps at bay the outside forces that would interfere with the pleasures of slow living. In an ad titled "Home Is a Haven," we see a father and daughter running to their house during a rainstorm. As they approach the front door, the child's teddy bears spring to life as human-sized entities (whose muscular physiques resemble bouncers at a club). The bears rearrange the house into an open play area and protect the dad from intrusive calls and other outside distractions. We watch as father and daughter play dress-up and numerous other games, eventually falling asleep after their fully engaged bonding time (https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGgcYNlH02g">www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGgcYNlH02g</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">IKEA's "Let's Relax" commercial presents a pointedly critical take on the performative, competitive affectations of Instagram micro-influencers, for whom everyday social activities are treated as an instrumental means to garner likes and followers. In the ad, we first observe an eighteenth-century family about to begin formal dinner in a very well-appointed dining room. Suddenly, the father halts the proceedings so that an artist can paint a portrait of the meal, which is immediately transported across the town in a horse-drawn carriage so that affirmative thumbs up gestures from the populace can be tabulated. The scene then suddenly shifts to a modern-day kitchen table, where the same father meticulously photographs the family meal, while his wife and children begrudgingly wait for this documenting ritual to end. The dad sheepishly retires his camera, and the family begins their more enjoyable and authentic social interactions, all framed by the closing caption: "Relax: It's a meal, not a competition" (https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BXRGzjo1%5fQ">www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BXRGzjo1%5fQ</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on our semiotic framework, we anticipate that conscious capitalist brands would gain the most authenticating benefit from the humanistic rebel strategy when they present their brands as ideological allies ([48]; [49]) of consumers who are sensitized to the psychological and social costs of careerism, exclusionary status hierarchies, and the calculated practices of social media self-presentations. In this way, the humanistic rebel strategy undercuts the elitist critique by suggesting that a conscious capitalist brand enables consumers to tap into more basic and rewarding emotional and sensory experiences. It further emphasizes that helping people, from all walks of life, feel genuinely connected to each other is an important and accessible way to make the world a better place.</p><a id="AN0158338734-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-24" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing from structural semiotics ([40]), we have developed a conceptual framework that can be used to analyze the cultural contradictions of authenticity, as they emerge in a given market context, and then to identify strategies for combatting their disauthenticating associations.

When negotiating such dynamism, marketing managers need to identify strategically significant patterns in the flux of cultural change and to adroitly react to cultural flash points, competitive shifts, and other exogenous shocks that could undermine the credibility of their existing authenticity claims. Whether undertaken in the context of conscious capitalist brands, status-marketing luxury goods, price-driven big-box retailers, or sharing-economy enterprises such as Uber or Airbnb, marketing managers can use our semiotic approach to more effectively negotiate the sociocultural complexity inherent to the process of authenticating their strategic assets.</p><a id="AN0158338734-25"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0158338734-25" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Rob Kozinets</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  For purposes of expositional clarity, our analysis will not explicitly highlight these two paths of contradictory relations.

Yet, despite the widespread use of such web data, the idiosyncratic and sometimes insidious challenges in its collection have received limited attention. How can researchers ensure that the data sets generated via web scraping and APIs are valid? While existing resources emphasize technical details of extracting web data, the authors propose a novel methodological framework focused on enhancing its validity. In particular, the framework highlights how addressing validity concerns requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical questions along the three stages of collecting web data: selecting data sources, designing the data collection, and extracting the data. The authors further review more than 300 articles using web data published in the top five marketing journals and offer a typology of how web data have advanced marketing thought. The article concludes with directions for future research to identify promising web data sources and embrace novel approaches for using web data to capture and describe evolving marketplace realities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: web scraping; application programming interface; API; crawling; validity; user-generated content; social media; big data</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The accelerating digitization of social and commercial life has created an unprecedented number of digital traces of consumer and firm behavior. Every minute, users worldwide conduct 5.7 million searches on Google, make 6 million commercial transactions, and share 65,000 photos on Instagram ([76]). The resulting web data—enormous in size, diverse in form, and often publicly accessible on the internet—is a potential goldmine for marketing scholars who want to quantify consumption, gain insights on firm behavior, and track social activities difficult or costly to observe otherwise. The importance of web data for marketing research is reflected in a growing number of impactful publications across all methodological traditions, including consumer culture theory, consumer psychology, empirical modeling, and marketing strategy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers can use web scraping and application programming interfaces (APIs) to efficiently collect web data at scale. Web scraping is the process of developing software to automatically collect information displayed in a web browser. For example, researchers can scrape Amazon's website to construct data sets of online consumer reviews. Because many websites and web apps are publicly accessible, data sets can be generated without involving data providers. In contrast, some data providers also offer APIs for programmatic access to their internal databases. For example, scholars can apply for academic research access to retrieve data from the Twitter API. Researchers can also access a wide range of algorithms via APIs. For instance, Google offers advanced image and video recognition through its Cloud Vision API (for additional examples and explanations, see Table W1 in Web Appendix A).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Data extracted from the internet, at first sight, might resemble other organically generated data sets that address related research questions (e.g., a firm's clickstream data). Yet, collecting web data for academic use in a highly automated manner may prompt a set of novel and sometimes insidious validity challenges. Validity concerns may arise from, among others, (<a id="bib1up

First, we develop a methodological framework that highlights how addressing validity concerns arising from web scraping and APIs requires the joint consideration of idiosyncratic technical and legal/ethical concerns. Within marketing, guidance exists for collecting web data in the consumer culture theory research tradition, particularly using netnography (e.g., [46], [47]). A handful of articles address selected challenges that occur during the automatic extraction of web data (e.g., sampling; [39]). Outside of marketing, tutorials and books primarily focus on technical details for the automatic extraction of web data (see Table W2 in Web Appendix B). Yet, neither these resources nor methodological articles in other disciplines (e.g., [19]; [52]) address the broad spectrum of validity concerns arising from the automatic collection of web data for academic use. It is this void that our methodological framework fills. In discussing the methodological framework, we offer a stylized marketing example for illustration and provide recommendations for addressing challenges researchers encounter during the collection of web data via web scraping and APIs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, despite the use of web data in marketing for two decades, no systematic review reflects on how it has and could advance marketing thought. Importantly, understanding the richness and versatility of web data is invaluable for scholars curious about integrating it into their research programs. To offer these insights, we have systematically reviewed more than 300 articles in the top five marketing journals across two decades that have used web data. We leverage our coding to reveal which web sources have been considered and how data have been extracted. The resulting typology of web data may spark the imagination of researchers interested in generating new marketing insights from web data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we use our methodological framework and typology to unearth new and underexploited "fields of gold" associated with web data. We seek to demystify the use of web scraping and APIs and thereby facilitate broader adoption of web data across the marketing discipline. Our future research section highlights novel and creative avenues of using web data that include exploring underutilized sources, creating rich multisource data sets, and fully exploiting the potential of APIs beyond data extraction. We particularly highlight the value of web scraping and APIs for research streams that have not yet embraced them at scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In what follows, we provide an overview of the use of web data in marketing and document four pathways through which web data have advanced marketing thought. We then introduce our methodological framework to help researchers make sensible design decisions when automatically extracting web data. We conclude with directions for future research.</p><a id="AN0158338735-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-2" title="Using Web Data to Advance Marketing Thought">Using Web Data to Advance Marketing Thought</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across the top five marketing journals, marketing researchers increasingly use information available on the internet. For example, the share of web data–based publications has more than tripled in the last decade, from about 4% in 2010 to 15% in 2020 (see the thick line in Figure 1). The growing use of web data has been fueled by its increased accessibility and associated time and cost savings. Most of the 313 identified web data–based articles rely on web scraping (59%); APIs are used much more sparingly (12%), and some articles combine web scraping and APIs (9%). The remaining articles—especially netnographic work—use web data but tend to extract it manually (20%). The median annual citation count of articles using web data is 7.55, compared with 3.90 for publications not using web data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. Increased use of web data in marketing (2001–2020).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some of the earliest uses of web data in marketing can be attributed to the development of netnography to study online communities (e.g., [46], [45]). Subsequently, the first quantitative marketing scholars extracted web data at scale (e.g., [27]). Today, all subfields—including marketing strategy and consumer behavior—have embraced web data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online word of mouth and social media are the most prominent domains of inquiry using web scraping (see Table W3 in Web Appendix C). The most widely used data source in academic marketing research is Amazon (38 articles). Other prevalent sources are Twitter (30), IMDb (24), Facebook, and Google Trends (both 22; see Table W4 in Web Appendix C).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Via a comprehensive literature review, we next identify the four central pathways through which web data facilitate the creation of new knowledge in marketing.</p><a id="AN0158338735-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-3" title="Studying New Phenomena">Studying New Phenomena</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data can boost the field's relevance by enabling marketing scholars to study novel phenomena. For example, initial work using web data focused on novel online phenomena that emerged at the beginning of this century, such as online conversations ([27]) and the impact of consumer reviews on sales ([14]). Web data are well suited to provide fertile grounds for inductive research to develop novel theories about emerging marketing phenomena (e.g., brand public; [<a id="bib4up

This inherent timeliness of web data continues to be an essential lever for marketing scholars to advance our understanding of emerging substantive topics such as the sharing economy (e.g., Airbnb; [93]), access-based business models (e.g., Spotify; [15]), and fake online content (e.g., [<a id="bib3up

More generally, web data enable researchers to weigh in on contemporary issues before any "conventional" data sets become available, such as measuring the effect of pandemic lockdown policies on consumption ([74]).</p><a id="AN0158338735-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-4" title="Boosting Ecological Value">Boosting Ecological Value</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data can create knowledge by allowing researchers to move closer to marketing's "natural habitat" ([83]). Some of the most used web sources contain commercial outcome variables relevant to marketing stakeholders and are difficult or costly to collect otherwise. Examples are sales (e.g., The-Numbers.com), sales ranks (e.g., Amazon), online searches (e.g., Google Trends), and donations (e.g., contributions to a Kiva project).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As web data can be collected unobtrusively, they can effectively complement more controlled data collection methods. Using web data, researchers can demonstrate that focal psychological processes occur outside the confines of a controlled laboratory environment and stylized experimental stimuli ([64]). Consider, for instance, the controversy around the decoy effect ([37])—one of the most prominent context effects in consumer behavior. Using experiments, [23] questioned the robustness and practical relevance of the decoy effect. In response, [90] built a panel data set from an online diamond market using web data. Their work not only shows that the decoy effect emerges in a high-stakes setting but also, more importantly, reaffirms its practical significance by quantifying its profit implications for the diamond retailer.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another benefit of using web data to boost ecological value is that they can often be collected without the data provider's direct involvement. Thereby, researchers can limit the interference of data suppliers or collaborating firms to ensure that the societal relevance of a particular research question is given precedence over business objectives (e.g., firms might be unwilling to share data about the tracking tools they use on websites; [81]). Further, using web data, researchers can ensure the publication of research findings, regardless of how palatable they are to the organizations that are being studied.</p><a id="AN0158338735-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-5" title="Facilitating Methodological Advancement">Facilitating Methodological Advancement</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As much of the data produced by consumers and firms is inherently unstructured, extracting insights can be challenging ([88]).

Researchers typically start with a broad set of potential data sources and eliminate some of them as a function of three key considerations—validity, technical feasibility, and legal/ethical risks. These three considerations appear in the corners of an inverted pyramid, with validity at the bottom to underscore its importance. Given the difficulty in projecting the exact characteristics of the final data set before it is collected, researchers often revisit these considerations as they design, prototype, and refine their data collection. Failure to resolve technical or legal/ethical issues might mean that web data cannot inform the research question meaningfully.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

We examine three challenges faced by researchers in this selection process. First, it is essential that researchers explore the universe of potential sources (challenge #1.1). Second, researchers need to consider the range of possible extraction methods (challenge #1.2). Third, it is crucial to map the context in which the data are generated (challenge #1.3). Table 2 summarizes our recommendations for tackling these challenges.</p><a id="AN0158338735-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-10" title="Exploring the Universe of Potential Sources (Challenge #1.1)">Exploring the Universe of Potential Sources (Challenge #1.1)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the absence of conventional gatekeepers (e.g., data providers), researchers can select from countless web data sources. For example, there are 2.1 million online retailers in the United States alone ([20]). Further, websites and APIs differ greatly in scope (e.g., number of users), data quality (e.g., consistency), and retrievability (e.g., extraction limits). Even within the same product category, data sources differ vastly. For example, Amazon reports a book's sales rank (an aggregate outcome metric for product sales), whereas Goodreads reports users' reading behavior (an individual outcome metric for consumers' usage intensity).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Faced with a vast universe of potential sources, researchers may be tempted to focus on familiar platforms only ([89]). For instance, Amazon is the most used web data source in marketing (see Table W4 in Web Appendix C). Amazon might be a relevant source to extract book reviews, given its broad assortment and user base. Yet, in other cases, researchers might miss opportunities for identifying novel, emerging marketing phenomena or conduct more compelling theory testing without a thorough exploration of potential sources. Researchers can avoid the pitfalls of defaulting to dominant sources by actively considering a broad spectrum of websites and APIs, ranging from highly popular (e.g., Amazon) to less popular sources (e.g., Goodreads), from primary data providers (e.g., YouTube) to data aggregators (e.g., Social Blade), and from platforms with global reach (e.g., Twitter) to more regional ones (e.g., Taringa!). Another strategy to move beyond familiar sources is to adopt alternative perspectives. For instance, researchers can consider websites or APIs that are used by consumers, analysts, or managers. API directories at GitHub or programmableweb.com can facilitate identifying potentially relevant APIs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A broad exploration of web data sources may lead researchers to discover sources that may be more permissive for (academic) data extraction or less likely to trigger ethical concerns. For example, websites that do not require logging into the site to reveal information are typically more scraping-friendly than sites that first require registering a user account. In the case of Amazon, researchers can obtain most information without logging in and do not have to explicitly provide their agreement to the website's Terms of Service. To reduce legal (e.g., breaches of contract, as researchers have provided explicit agreements to the terms of service) and ethical (e.g., website users may consider their data private) risks, researchers should refrain from creating fake accounts to access information requiring a login. By explicitly declaring their academic status (e.g., when registering at the site using the institutional email address), researchers might be able to diminish their exposure to legal risk.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When exploring web sources, researchers need to examine whether theoretical constructs can be operationalized in a valid manner ([91]). A healthy level of skepticism is warranted when using idiosyncratic metrics from APIs or websites. For example, researchers might be interested in scraping the price tier of restaurants from Yelp. Yet, it is not entirely clear how Yelp computes this metric from individual consumer ratings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To determine when to stop exploring sources, researchers need to assess to what extent the selected source(s) improve(s) on alternatives. One way to justify selecting a single web source is the presence of unique features. For example, a researcher studying how observers react to humor in reviews might prefer Yelp to alternative platforms as it is the only source featuring "funny" votes (e.g., [60]). At other times, researchers may be indifferent between potential sources and can draw from multiple sources to boost the generalizability of their findings (e.g., tweets and restaurant reviews; [61]). Collecting data from multiple sources is often useful because even similar types of information (e.g., consumer comments) may affect marketing outcomes differently, depending on source characteristics (e.g., forums vs. microblogs; [72]). Data aggregators—some of which offer authorized data access via APIs—facilitate the collection of such multisource data.</p><a id="AN0158338735-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-11" title="Considering Alternatives to Web Scraping (Challenge #1.2)">Considering Alternatives to Web Scraping (Challenge #1.2)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The popularity of web scraping may lead to the conclusion that it should be preferred over other methods. However, some web sources offer access to data via APIs ([12]). In general, extracting data via APIs is more scalable and less likely to invoke the same level of legal risks compared with web scraping. Although some sources offer unconstrained APIs that do not require authentication, others require (paid) subscriptions and authentication procedures. Some sources, such as Twitter, have recently started offering APIs for academic research. In the case of Amazon, an API offering access to consumer reviews is currently not available.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to APIs, numerous other options exist for researchers to obtain web data. For example, some data providers (e.g., Yelp, IMDb), public data platforms (e.g., Kaggle, The Dataverse Project), and researchers (e.g., [59]) provide documented web data sets that can readily be used for academic research. There are many potential use cases of such data sets, but less than 5% of all web data–based articles in marketing used such data sets. To avoid the pitfall of defaulting to web scraping for data extraction, researchers can expand their search by explicitly including terms such as "API" or "data set download" in their search queries.</p><a id="AN0158338735-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-12" title="Mapping the Data Context (Challenge #1.3)">Mapping the Data Context (Challenge #1.3)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Relative to other frequently used archival sources in marketing, web data entail large and often undocumented complexities. Thus, it is critical that researchers map the data context, which involves identifying relevant contextual developments that may undermine the validity of the research if gone unnoticed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, mapping the data context may reveal changes in the underlying data structure. For example, a major change in a platform's user interface may affect subsequent consumer behavior. Second, mapping the data context enables researchers to identify relevant pieces of information for collection together with the focal web data. For example, researchers may discover an external website (e.g., Statista) that offers information about the composition of a focal data source's user base. If stored, such data could eventually be used to detect changes in the composition of the user base or verify the representativeness of the extracted data. Third, mapping the data context may reveal unknown information, potentially allowing researchers to discover novel research opportunities. For example, researchers may use the (unexpected) launch of a new recommendation system at a music streaming service as a natural experiment to investigate the impact of recommendations on music consumption.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To understand and map the contextual complexity of web data, researchers can immerse themselves in the ecosystem surrounding the focal source by signing up and using the source, tracking press releases, social media, and scanning the competitive environment. Helpful tools include a search engine's advanced search features, newsletters, and alerts on leading business and technology magazines (e.g., TechCrunch.com, WSJ.com, FT.com). The website's source code may also hold valuable information about potentially relevant environmental changes. Sometimes, researchers may also detect the presence of algorithms on the site that may threaten the validity of the collected data. For example, Amazon's product pages personalize information based on which preceding products were viewed—even without users logging into the site.</p><a id="AN0158338735-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-13" title="Designing the Data Collection">Designing the Data Collection</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After narrowing down potential sources, researchers decide which information to extract from them (challenge #2.1), how to sample (challenge #2.2), at which frequency to extract the information (challenge #2.3), and how to process the information during the collection (challenge #2.4).

(Challenge #2.1)">Which Information to Extract? (Challenge #2.1)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the absence of any "downloadable" data set, the first challenge lies in deciding which information to extract from a source. Researchers begin by browsing the web page to identify from which pages to extract which information. In our Amazon example, some of the most commonly used pages are product pages (e.g., [14]) and review pages (e.g., [84]). Generally, pages such as those from e-commerce platforms contain information from the company's database, offering researchers the opportunity to capture some of the information available at a company. Collecting such data involves <em>iterating</em> through a set of related pages (i.e., browsing through many product pages and corresponding review pages in our Amazon example) and saving the data as it becomes visible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As the goal of websites like Amazon is rarely the provision of data sets for academic research, it is often necessary to combine information from different pages (e.g., book descriptions from the product page and ratings from the review page). It is particularly difficult to recognize the subtleties of available information, which makes the decision from which pages to extract information challenging. For example, researchers interested in building a data set of book reviews would find total ratings both on the product and review page, but only the review page reveals <em>all</em> product reviews.[<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref54" title="7">7</a>] Yet, neither the product nor the review pages contain all the biographical information available on a reviewer's profile page. Widely exploring a website or API is necessary for identifying information relevant for subsequent analysis (e.g., construct operationalization). The amount and type of information also often vary (e.g., depending on screen width or whether the user is logged in). In this phase, researchers should assess the degree to which the information could be considered personal or sensitive under different regulatory regimes (e.g., the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]), which may require planning measures such as pseudo-anonymization of reviewer names. Researchers may also reassess whether all information needs to be captured to meet the research objective. Suppose reviewer names are strictly necessary (e.g., because they allow for matching different sources). In that case, researchers can explore whether the targeted web data source offers ways to exclude subjects governed by prohibitive privacy regulations (e.g., by using filters).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An important threat to internal validity in any study involving web data is algorithmic interference (e.g., [91]). The (visual) design of websites that facilitates usability can undermine the validity of the collected data if gone unnoticed and unaddressed. Especially when deciding which information to extract, it is important to reexamine the website or API for the presence of algorithms. For example, the order in which the researchers in our example visited the website while designing their data extraction could affect which related books are displayed on the product pages on Amazon. Other algorithms that often affect the display of data on websites are sorting algorithms (e.g., by popularity or mixed with sponsored search results) and filtering algorithms (e.g., showing subsets of the data). Algorithmic interference is often hard to detect without being sensitive to it. To account for potential algorithmic interference, the researcher might extract variables as part of an algorithm's more extensive set of input variables, which offers opportunities to control for them in the empirical analysis (e.g., the order in which books were extracted in our Amazon example).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers also need to establish the intertemporal stability of available information. Because the web is constantly evolving, the information on a page might not have been generated via the same process over time, undermining the internal validity of the data. Some changes to sources are drastic enough to alter how the data were created in the first place, introducing measurement error ([87]). For example, Amazon shifted to a positive-only evaluation of reviews by removing the "not helpful" vote button in 2018, and it no longer displays "not helpful" counts next to reviews ([28]). This change might have impacted review content (e.g., users writing shorter review texts). Yet, researchers collecting data today cannot find any traces of these "not helpful" votes. A tool for examining changes to relevant information on a website is the Wayback Machine (archive.org). Researchers can use this tool to retroactively inspect websites over time (e.g., [58]) or submit their own website links for archiving.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, collecting metadata that "annotates" the data collection enhances internal and external validity (e.g., storing the timestamp of data extraction, whether an API request was completed successfully, or the IP address from which the data request was made). Such metadata can be used not only for diagnostic purposes but also to link the extracted web data to other data sets. For example, in our Amazon example, the collected data could be linked to other data using IP-based geolocations (e.g., linking geolocation and web search data; [86]) or timestamps (e.g., linking reviews to stock prices; [78]).</p><a id="AN0158338735-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-15" title="How to Sample? (Challenge #2.2)">How to Sample? (Challenge #2.2)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second challenge in designing the data extraction lies in deciding how to sample from the data source. In particular, in the absence of access to the data source's <em>entire</em> database, it is difficult or impossible to draw a random sample from the population (e.g., all products) available at the data source. Instead, researchers need to devise their own sampling frame to reveal the units they want to sample from the website ([66]). For example, researchers could scan the site for an index of all products that could inform their sampling. In our example studying reviews at Amazon, multiple such indexes may be available. Should products be sampled from the bestseller page for books (so-called exposure-based populations; [66]) or instead from the category page for books (i.e., availability-based populations)? Choices like this result in different data and may even invalidate inferences, as sampling frames might inadvertently induce systematic bias ([39]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One common validity challenge in choosing how to sample is determining how many units (e.g., books) are sufficient to inform the research question. From a validity standpoint, it would be ideal to collect information on the entire population (e.g., all books available at Amazon). However, Amazon does not have an obvious page to extract <em>all</em> books. Imagine that a research team wanted to collect information about all marketing books sold on Amazon. The bestseller page, for example, lists only the top 100 bestsellers. By manually changing pagination parameters in the URL, the top 400 bestsellers can be revealed. Yet, this list of 400 books neither constitutes the entire population nor represents a random sample of marketing books sold at Amazon. Alternatively, when starting from the product overview pages, these pages list an imprecise number of books (e.g., "over 60,000"), which can only be viewed up to page 50. With each result page featuring 24 organic search results, this approach would produce 1,600 books per category at best. Thus, researchers need to consider other ways to identify more books on Amazon, such as searching for books using various keywords. To expand the number of sampled units, researchers could collect data multiple times, use other keywords, or tweak search parameters to reveal more data by requesting narrower subsets from the database (e.g., only books published during a specific month).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Even if a list of the population (e.g., all books) could be retrieved, it may be infeasible to extract data within a reasonable time frame. While sample size requirements are mostly concerned with a researcher's inferential goals (e.g., [50]), few articles make the resource constraints that affect collecting web data explicit (e.g., [68]). For example, with web data, a study's sample size critically depends on technical parameters such as the number of computers used for data extraction or the number of pages that need to be visited. We illustrate how to calculate the technically feasible sample size in Web Appendix F, which may effectively complement traditional sample size calculations commonplace in marketing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a result of these complications, researchers often restrict their sample size. One way to motivate a compelling sampling frame is to use <em>external</em> sources that can be linked to the web data. For instance, the <em>New York Times</em> or <em>Publishers Weekly</em> bestseller lists might be a starting point for sampling books ([14]). An alternative approach focuses on internal data available at the source itself. Researchers may have to allocate substantial time to identify ways to sample from the focal source. Sometimes, starting the data collection from a page unrelated to the focal pages of interest might facilitate collecting a more representative sample (e.g., by reducing geographical biases; [86]). For example, on Amazon, researchers could first sample reviewers and associated demographic information (available at the user profile of reviewers) and subsequently retrieve data on all reviewed products. Similar to how researchers build network data from an initial set of products or users, the sampling units retrieved from an initial set of pages can be considered seeds. In choosing seeds, researchers should be cautious about drawing from vulnerable populations (e.g., minors) or infringing on prohibitive privacy regulations.</p><a id="AN0158338735-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-16" title="At Which Frequency to Extract Information? (Challenge #2.3)">At Which Frequency to Extract Information? (Challenge #2.3)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data are nonstatic, as they change often or might disappear altogether. Therefore, researchers need to consider at which frequency to extract information. This decision encompasses whether to collect data once or multiple times and when to run (and potentially schedule) the data extraction. Consideration of the frequency and schedule is challenging but required to ensure the intertemporal stability of measurement, which is critical for internal and construct validity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a technical and legal perspective, it is most desirable to extract data only once. Single extractions are less likely to represent a burden on the firm's servers, and the extracted data often only represent a limited snapshot of the entire database, reducing the risks of copyright infringement. Further, such data may be more likely to respect users' "right to be forgotten," which is part of the privacy laws in some jurisdictions. Yet, single data extraction might raise several validity issues that can easily go unnoticed. For instance, in our example, researchers extracting book reviews <em>once</em> from Amazon will not be able to identify whether any of the archival information has changed. Only when extracting data <em>multiple times</em> can researchers systematically notice changes on the site, which may lead to the identification of "fake" reviews that have been removed by the platform (e.g., [29]). More generally, researchers can compare information over time to detect whether data that initially appeared to be archival is truly archival (i.e., does not change over time).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another concern is that a single extraction may not produce a data set that adequately maps onto the focal processes of interest. For example, suppose researchers in our example want to examine whether a review by a so-called "Top 1000 Reviewer" leads to more subsequent reviews from other users. However, the researcher merely observes that the reviewer is a top reviewer at the time of data extraction. This does not necessarily imply that this user had the same status when the review was first posted and thus was most likely to affect subsequent reviewing behavior of other users. Formulating and testing the essential assumptions about the data, including the relation between the time of data extraction and the focal (psychological) processes, is thus critical. The formulation of such assumptions is called a "data source theory" ([52]). Testing and refining the data source theory helps take proactive steps to enhance internal and construct validity. In the preceding example, it would thus be necessary to collect data from these review pages closer to the original posting date, ensuring that reviewers classified as "Top Reviewers" had that status when their reviews became visible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When extracting data more than once, automatic scheduling can help ensure consistency and contribute to validity. Scheduling is beneficial if the required information is only available in real-time. For example, sales ranks at Amazon are updated hourly for popular products, and historical sales ranks cannot be retrieved. Suppose researchers in our example were interested in studying the sales performance of books over time. In that case, they could repeatedly extract the books' sales ranks from the product pages at Amazon. Sometimes fixed intervals enhance validity (e.g., every Monday, 8 a.m.). In other circumstances (e.g., when collecting data from many pages), it may be better to vary the starting time or weekday of the data extraction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another decision is whether to set an end date for the data extraction. Collecting data over extended periods offers the potential for researchers to build a programmatic stream of research and stumble into unexpected natural experiments (e.g., [13]). Especially for longitudinal data collections, continuing the data collection while the project is in the review process brings numerous benefits, such as the ability to update the data (e.g., a longer time frame, new measures). Yet, concerns about technical feasibility (e.g., storage requirements, continued availability of data source) grow as the data extraction horizon extends. Similarly, from an ethical perspective, the longer the data extraction, the greater the likelihood of potentially identifying individuals via triangulation. Next to ethics, long-term data collection also places a heavier load on servers, potentially increasing exposure to legal risks.</p><a id="AN0158338735-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-17" title="How to Process the Information During the Extraction?

(Challenge #2.4)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a final step in designing the data extraction, researchers decide how to process the information <em>while it is collected</em>. Any kind of web data collection requires a minimal degree of processing, given that the information is available in a computer's memory (e.g., in the browser or the software processing the API output) and still needs to be stored in files or databases. Thus, this processing step occurs <em>before</em> data sets are cleaned or analyzed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When deciding on how to process information during the extraction, researchers must balance potential efficiency gains from molding raw web data into readily usable data sets with the potential threats to validity due to "on-the-fly" processing. For example, in our Amazon example, researchers may be tempted to remove seemingly unnecessary information (e.g., image links in reviews), apply text processing (e.g., removing characters used as separators), or force specific information (e.g., prices) to be stored in a strictly numeric format. Such on-the-fly processing promises to produce essential efficiency gains, as the data set resulting from the extraction could directly be analyzed. However, because on-the-fly processing decisions are usually made after the inspection of only a limited number of pages in early prototypes of the data collection, it is difficult to guarantee their correctness. For example, using our example, what if the initial screening revealed only pictures posted in a review, while the extensive data collection revealed the need to capture video files? Given this and related challenges, keeping the raw data (such as the source code of websites, API output, or any media files loaded at the time of data extraction) is ideal from a validity perspective. For example, even if the data collection breaks, researchers could still process and use the information after debugging their extraction code. Retaining the raw data can also help reduce Type 1 errors by increasing transparency about researchers' degree of freedom in collecting and processing the web data. Yet, retaining the raw data prompts significant concerns about the technical feasibility and ethical risks. From a technical standpoint, storing the raw data might require databases to retain their original structure and facilitate processing, especially for projects involving many raw data files collected over extended periods. Keeping all raw data might raise questions regarding the right to store the raw data—especially if it is not (pseudo-) anonymized before storage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, retaining the raw data allows researchers to refine their extraction design at later project stages. For example, a researcher might have collected Amazon reviews in 2018—around the time of the removal of the "not helpful" voting feature. Although extracting "not helpful" votes was not part of the original extraction design, researchers would be able to use the raw web data to examine the effect of the removal of these "not helpful" votes.</p><a id="AN0158338735-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-18" title="Collecting the Data">Collecting the Data</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After source selection and designing the data collection, researchers gradually transition to turning their small-scale prototype into stable extraction software.

Second, they may need to implement monitoring checks to be alerted to any issues arising during extended data collections (challenge #3.2). Third, researchers should compile information important for documenting the final data set (challenge #3.3).

Such technical challenges, if unaddressed, have the potential to undermine research validity (e.g., missing data, not meeting sample size requirements). A practical solution to preempt these and similar challenges involves capturing the focal information in different ways and storing raw data—especially in the early stages of data collection and for more ambitious, large-scale web data collection projects. To track whether the extraction targets are met, researchers can log the (timestamped) URLs of scraped pages and visualize the performance of the extraction software over an extended period. The resulting "effective" extraction frequency can then be used in recomputing the technically feasible sample size (see Web Appendix F). Novel web scraping services promise to handle technical difficulties efficiently (e.g., ScrapingBee, Zyte).</p><a id="AN0158338735-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-20" title="How to Monitor Data Quality During the Extraction?

When collecting over long periods, automatic reporting can greatly facilitate monitoring.

This is an essential step in building documentation, enabling future data usage by the researcher(s) who collected the data and other scholars. Even after the data extraction has ended, researchers can continuously refine the documentation as they become familiar with the characteristics of the data (e.g., variables that were erroneously captured, missing values).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Accurate and comprehensive documentation is particularly critical given that collecting web data tends to involve repeated iterations between discovery (and often troubleshooting) and confirmation (i.e., subsequent analyses that are outside the scope of our framework). Designing web data extractions requires a different mindset compared with experiments or archival research. Unlike running experiments, the extraction design for collecting web data may be in flux, even when the collection is already running. Relative to traditional archival research in which data sets are sufficiently annotated, researchers are in charge of accurately recalling details about the data collection. Such details encompass information about the data composition (e.g., sampled units), extraction process (e.g., annotated code, detected errors during the collection), and processing details (e.g., applied cleaning steps). The template of [24] provides a useful starting point for building the documentation for a data set collected via web scraping or APIs. Given that contextual changes are inevitable (see challenge #1.3), documenting the source's institutional background (e.g., screenshots, corporate blog posts, API documentation) is crucial.</p><a id="AN0158338735-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-22" title="Future Research Opportunities with Web Data">Future Research Opportunities with Web Data</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An unprecedented gold rush of web data has enriched the marketing discipline for two decades—over 300 published articles provide countless examples of impactful marketing insights using web data.

We encourage researchers to focus on underused or niche sources that have received limited or no attention in marketing. Web data are often prized, as they allow for collecting "consequential dependent variables from the 'real world'" ([40], p. 357). Identifying new sources or novel consequential variables constitutes a promising avenue for discovering emerging phenomena.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consider, for example, the twilight state of the nascent legal cannabis industry in the United States. While more states are legalizing cannabis for medical and recreational use, the market value of the <em>legal</em> U.S. cannabis industry was still less than a third of the illegal market in 2020 (i.e., $20 billion vs. $66 billion; [22]). Using surveys, media coverage, and in-depth interviews, marketing scholars have begun to explore how such legalized markets emerge and seek legitimacy ([38]). Sociologists and organizational scholars, in turn, have already used web data to compile intriguing data sets from sources such as Weedmaps. Using these data, they examine, for example, how existing medical cannabis dispensaries have repositioned themselves after the entry of recreational dispensaries ([34]) or how consumers deal with potential stigma transfer (Khessina, Reis, and Cameron Verhaal 2021). By leveraging similar web data, marketing researchers could explore intriguing marketing questions. For instance, how should brands position themselves (e.g., brand personalities, emphasis on product vs. service), depending on the strength of categorical stigma? What are the potential public health and welfare implications of the increasing competition among cannabis dispensaries or their growing social media activities?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to being attuned to work in other disciplines, a low-tech route for source exploration is provided by Similarweb, which allows researchers to browse website rankings by region or category. Given the broad accessibility of web sources worldwide, the dominance of Northern American and European data sources is surprising. Not a single article focuses exclusively on African web sources, and only a handful of articles use some African data (e.g., [49]). Possible starting points for branching out into these underexplored marketplaces could be popular websites such as Nairaland.com (online community), bidorbuy.co.za (auction platform), and Jumia.com.ng (e-commerce).</p><a id="AN0158338735-25"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-25" title="Build unique and rich data sets by drawing from multiple sources">Build unique and rich data sets by drawing from multiple sources</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Most published marketing articles use web data gathered from a single source. Only very few articles collect data from a large number of web sources (i.e., 50 or more web sources). Following the lead of these articles, we encourage marketing researchers to envision unique data sets compiled from many and diverse sources. For example, in economics, [10] collected online and offline prices for individual goods sold by 56 large multichannel retailers in ten countries (i.e., United States, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and South Africa) between 2014 and 2016. This "Billion Prices Project" (bpp.mit.edu; [11]) exemplifies how creative and ambitious data collection from diverse web sources can fuel entire research programs. Especially if sufficiently documented, such web data are poised to unearth new fields of gold for the marketing discipline.</p><a id="AN0158338735-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-26" title="Rediscover frequently used sources">Rediscover frequently used sources</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As researchers decide which information to extract (see challenge #2.1), they may overlook novel information on sources they already know.

In most articles, the data were extracted once (e.g., on a single occasion). Extracting data once is sufficient for many research objectives, such as demonstrating the prevalence of a phenomenon in the marketplace (e.g., [79]). Yet, researchers can also uncover novel marketing phenomena by creatively envisioning web data sets that only reveal the phenomenon if the information is extracted multiple times. For example, [29] leverage the observation that Amazon removed certain reviews to study the market for "fake" reviews. Specifically, they combine repeatedly web-scraped data from Amazon with hand-coded data from large private groups on Facebook used to solicit fake reviews to examine the short- and long-term impact of such rating manipulations. This example illustrates that data imperfections (e.g., data modifications discovered when mapping the data context, see challenge #1.3) can be opportunities to pose novel research questions rather than merely nuisances that warrant correction.</p><a id="AN0158338735-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-28" title="Direction 2: Harvest the Versatility of Web Data to Boost Ecological Value">Direction 2: Harvest the Versatility of Web Data to Boost Ecological Value</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a second direction for knowledge discovery, web data are often used to increase the ecological value of marketing research by complementing carefully controlled experiments.

This enormous potential has hardly been realized in marketing, particularly at scale (for a creative smaller-scale application, see [62]). Social psychologists demonstrate the full potential of such an approach. Consider, for example, [33], who scraped 87 real-world profiles of doctors (including their fitness habits) from the website of a health insurance provider. These profiles served as the foundation for a novel stimulus-sampling paradigm wherein participants in experiments were presented with randomly selected subsets (i.e., five fitness-focused and five non-fitness-focused profiles). In doing so, the authors first ground the phenomenon in the field (i.e., that doctors signal their fitness habits) and then use stimuli created from real profiles to demonstrate that overweight and obese individuals are less likely to choose fitness-focused doctors for their own care. Such triangulation and the creation of larger and more representative samples of naturalistic stimuli enhance the replicability and generalizability of experimental effects ([42]). The experimental paradigms in core marketing topics (e.g., branding, advertising, pricing) and methods (e.g., lab experiments, conjoint studies) could benefit from similar applications to mimic real marketplaces. For instance, branding or advertising researchers might develop stimuli based on data extracted from sources like crowdfunding platforms or Bing's Image Search API (e.g., brand logos, ads, and slogans).</p><a id="AN0158338735-30"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-30" title="Run self-administered field experiments via APIs">Run self-administered field experiments via APIs</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While field experiments continue to be prized for their realism and high ecological value ([83]), very few published marketing articles use APIs to run field experiments (e.g., [51]; [80]). There are many untapped opportunities to run field experiments administered by researchers rather than cooperating partners (e.g., firms or charities). Using APIs to run field experiments gives researchers more control over the design and debriefing processes and allows for monitoring of granular participant behavior over longer periods. Thus, web data–based field experiments potentially produce more precise effect sizes and allow researchers to capture long-term effects ([26]). In such experiments, researchers might randomly assign users to different treatments, such as adding (vs. not adding) followers on Twitter ([80]) or assigning (vs. not assigning) Reddit's Gold Awards to user posts ([<a id="bib9up

By gathering high-frequency data via APIs, researchers can analyze how experimental treatments influence outcomes such as posting or the creativity of user-generated content. Alternatively, APIs can be leveraged to infuse realism into experiments, as embodied in [56], who developed "Hoogle," a mock search engine that relies on APIs offered by Google but only displays organic search results that are not altered based on previous user queries. We foresee many more creative future applications of web data to facilitate such field experimentation.</p><a id="AN0158338735-31"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-31" title="Direction 3: Adopt New Metrics and Methods for Generating Marketing Insights">Direction 3: Adopt New Metrics and Methods for Generating Marketing Insights</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A core topic in marketing research is to develop marketing metrics that can guide managerial decision making. Traditionally, many metrics have been based on offline information and established data providers (e.g., [21]). Given the continued growth and diversification of web data, it is tempting for marketing <em>managers</em> to focus more on web data for managing firm growth and profitability. Yet, deciding which information to select and extract for marketing insight is challenging (see challenge #2.1). More research is needed to help managers avoid succumbing to the streetlight effect (i.e., an "overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application, irrespective of their growth objective"; [18], pp. 164–65). But, how can researchers get started?</p><a id="AN0158338735-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-32" title="Explore which web sources provide cheaper, faster, or better marketing metrics">Explore which web sources provide cheaper, faster, or better marketing metrics</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Over the last decade, scholars have begun to explore which types of web data could proxy or improve on existing core marketing metrics. For example, managers may use search data extracted from Google to spot trends in the relative importance of their firm's product attributes, which is more cost effective than traditional methods ([17]). Mining Twitter data provides cheaper, real-time, and more actionable measures and insights about brand reputation than existing survey-based metrics like the Brand Asset Valuator data from the advertising agency VMLY&amp;R ([71]). Yet, in other circumstances, readily and cheaply available web data might not be a good substitute for more expensive or established proprietary data sources to uncover market structure ([70]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An exciting direction for future research is to explore what web data sources should be selected or combined to generate marketing insights that fuel firm growth. For instance, many novel metrics rely on textual data ([<a id="bib6up

This focus limits applications to markets using the same language employed by the original method (i.e., mostly English). Future research could explore what other types of web data might enable the creation of metrics and insights that allow real-time monitoring and managing diverse global markets. What insights can managers draw from differences and commonalities between the volume of different kinds of internet searches available via Google Trends (e.g., web search vs. image search vs. Google Shopping vs. YouTube search)? Alternatively, what insights about consumer preferences (or any other stakeholder) can be extracted from short videos posted on platforms such as TikTok?</p><a id="AN0158338735-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-33" title="Operate API-based microservices">Operate API-based microservices</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A fascinating opportunity arises from providing microservices via APIs to marketing stakeholders. This means that researchers not only use APIs to retrieve data but can also operate their own APIs to examine real marketplaces (e.g., using rplumber.io in R). Researchers in data science, for example, offer firms a framework for testing multiarmed bandit policies via APIs while at the same time gathering field experimental data ([48]). Marketing researchers could use similar API-powered microservices to study emerging topics such as recommendation systems (and resulting biases) or tap into a firm's customer relationship management system to validate new customer churn models. At a small scale, researcher-powered APIs could lower the entry barriers for firms to experiment with novel algorithms that have not yet been implemented in major software packages.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The provision of APIs provides access to novel types of data, while also increasing the timeliness and ecological value of such data. For example, consider the differences between web data collected by a web scraper and the underlying clickstream data stored in the company's database. The website may merely show aggregate statistics about the number of reviews posted. At the same time, the underlying clickstream data also feature information on every website visit (e.g., time, IP address). As with self-administered APIs, researchers define which information a company should submit (e.g., as input to a recommendation algorithm). Thus, researchers can gain access to unique firm data that are otherwise difficult to obtain. For example, large-scale studies with image and video data are still scarce in marketing. Offering image and video analysis as microservices may generate knowledge discovery for new image sources, such as GIFs used in social media (e.g., Giphy).</p><a id="AN0158338735-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-34" title="Direction 4: Exploit Efficiency Gains to Improve Measurement">Direction 4: Exploit Efficiency Gains to Improve Measurement</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data also have advanced marketing by improving measurement by efficiently collecting diverse variables.

As documented in Table W4 in Web Appendix C, many of the used sources in marketing are focused on online <em>consumer</em> behaviors, such as e-commerce websites (e.g., Amazon), online reviewing platforms (e.g., Yelp), social media sites (e.g., Twitter), and search engines (e.g., Google Trends). Relatively less research has focused on <em>firm</em> behavior online. Yet, by doing so, researchers could explore many core marketing constructs (e.g., service orientation, sustainability). For example, researchers could systematically collect information available on the websites of many firms to analyze which organizational factors influence how firms signal their service orientation (e.g., employees' digital presence; [30]) or environmental credentials (e.g., the B Corporations certification; [25]) to customers and other stakeholders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We encourage marketing researchers who have not yet used web data in their research to consider websites and APIs as valuable, rich, and timely sources to exploit the increased digitization of <em>all forms</em> of behaviors—not only online behavior. A recent example of bringing web data into an established "offline" research stream is [32], who scraped the annual reports of more than 8,000 firms from AnnualReports.com between 1998 and 2016. Web sources contain historical information about periods, even long before the web in its current form existed (e.g., 1998 in this case). The authors subsequently use these reports to develop a novel text-based measure of marketing excellence derived from firm letters to shareholders. Many other untapped online sources (e.g., job posting platforms) offer new insights into how firms communicate their marketing capabilities to external stakeholders beyond consumers, such as prospective employees, social activists, and investors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Particularly for the marketing–finance interface, the web features many understudied forms of investor-facing communication that are ripe for collection at scale. For example, which type of marketing topics besides marketing excellence (e.g., marketing capabilities, brand positioning, pricing) should top management emphasize to investors to increase firm valuation during investor relations presentations, investor days, or earnings calls? Researchers could also examine the relative importance of the content versus the delivery (e.g., the tone of the speaker on the recording of an investor day; see [85]). Such multimodal data can also benefit the inferences made in established research streams.</p><a id="AN0158338735-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-36" title="Embrace APIs for better measurement">Embrace APIs for better measurement</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">APIs offer many opportunities for improving measurement—some of which are unexpected. For example, consumer researchers planning to run longitudinal studies might consider APIs for automating processes for managing participants at scale, thereby reducing the operating costs (and potentially boosting sample size). The Amazon Mechanical Turk API and the various Prolific Academic APIs (e.g., Study API) are good starting points for running multiwave studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">APIs also enable much more than just retrieving data. For example, to reduce validity concerns in long-term data collection, researchers can use the Pushover API (https://pushover.net/api) to send monitoring alerts to their smartphones. The API of Amazon Web Services allows for the orchestration of virtual computing infrastructure (e.g., to capture data from different countries). Another fruitful avenue in which APIs are currently underused in marketing is facilitating stimuli selection. For example, a classic area of inquiry in marketing is how (background) music affects product and brand perceptions and choices (e.g., [<a id="bib8up

In 2022, background music is quite different (e.g., self-chosen, more diverse use cases). Researchers could use the Spotify Web API to select stimuli from millions of mood, sleep, or study playlists, thereby discovering perfect "lookalikes" that only differ on one focal attribute (e.g., tempo) but not on other acoustic attributes available at the API (e.g., valence, loudness). Even in this simple example, there might be a substantive interest in better understanding the effect of new background music on consumption choices, especially given the shift to working and studying from home.</p><a id="AN0158338735-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-37" title="Concluding Thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data have unearthed many fields of gold in marketing.

While our focus is primarily on authors, our work also spotlights crucial validity concerns to scholars reviewing web data–based research and practitioners interested in deriving accurate and actionable marketing insights from web data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We hope that our work encourages marketing scholars to integrate web data into their research programs.

Web data sources tend to feature a large N (i.e., many users) with many V (i.e., different pieces of information for potential variables) observable over a large T (i.e., many observations over extended periods of time and at a very granular level; [<a id="bib1up

Yet, collecting web data via web scraping or APIs provides limited information about the browsing behavior of individuals on the website that led to the creation of the data in the first place. Significant synergies exist by enriching clickstream stream data capturing such browsing processes with web data retrieved from web scraping and APIs (e.g., [54]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our work aims to bridge entrenched training silos (e.g., between quantitative marketing and consumer behavior). We encourage scholars to further integrate and leverage existing best practices with regard to the collection and analysis of web data (e.g., preregistration, addressing endogeneity). There is significant untapped potential for collaborations across methodological traditions to explore and exploit new fields of gold. Collecting valid web data can enable marketing as a discipline to enhance its relevance and assert intellectual leadership on important emerging substantive topics that are also increasingly studied in fields such as computer science, information systems, and management science ([63]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We would be remiss not to mention the nonmonetary costs of collecting web data via web scraping and APIs. While browsing the web is (mainly) free, researchers should not assume that collecting web data is costless. The prototype of a data collection can be ready and running in a matter of hours. Yet, researchers will often find out that the data collection does not work entirely as intended or encounter some of the challenges discussed in our methodological framework. Just like with any other method, the devil is in the details.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web data democratize data access and make our discipline more inclusive for scholars who would otherwise find it difficult to obtain access to data. To further reduce entry barriers, it would be helpful to create incentives (e.g., journal space) for rich web data sets and their documentation, like the Billion Prices Project ([11]). Similarly, authors can make their algorithms or data available for other researchers by sharing code publicly or deploying API-based microservices that can increase their methods' adoption and offer unique opportunities for field experimentation. In summary, web data present a golden opportunity to examine important marketing questions, now and in the future.</p><a id="AN0158338735-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338735-38" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429221100750 - Supplemental material for Fields of Gold: Scraping Web Data for Marketing Insights</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429221100750 for Fields of Gold: Scraping Web Data for Marketing Insights by Johannes Boegershausen, Hannes Datta, Abhishek Borah and Andrew T.

The authors demonstrate that exposure to dogs (cats) reminds consumers of the stereotypical temperaments and behaviors of the pet species, which activates a promotion- (prevention-) focused motivational mindset among consumers. Using secondary data, Study 1 shows that people in states with a higher percentage of dog (cat) owners Google more promotion- (prevention-) focused words and report a higher COVID-19 transmission rate. Using multiple products, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that these regulatory mindsets, when activated by pet exposure, carry over to influence downstream consumer judgments, purchase intentions, and behaviors, even in pet-unrelated consumption contexts. Study 4 shows that pet stereotypicality moderates the proposed effect such that the relationship between pet exposure and regulatory orientations persists to the extent consumers are reminded of the stereotypical temperaments and behaviors of the pet species. Studies 5–7 examine the role of regulatory fit and evince that exposure to dogs (cats) leads to more favorable responses toward advertising messages featuring promotion- (prevention-) focused appeals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: pets; regulatory orientation; advertising; COVID-19</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Pets are prevalent and play important roles in consumers' daily lives ([<a id="bib2up

Dogs and cats are the most popular pets, with 48% of U.S. households (60 million homes) owning at least one dog and 37% of U.S. households (47 million homes) owning at least one cat. Pet adoption rates have climbed significantly, with about one in five households having acquired a dog or cat since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals [ASPCA] 2021). Pets also frequently appear in popular culture, mass media, and marketing communications. For example, Target uses a dog as its brand mascot, Microsoft features dogs in its 2020 holiday commercial to inspire people to find joy, and Wells Fargo uses a cat in its commercial to advertise its suspicious card activity alert services.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite the significance of pets in people's lives and in mass media, popular culture, and marketing communications, scant research has examined how pets may influence consumers' judgments, decisions, and behaviors. Existing research on pet–human relationships largely revolves around examining how owning a pet influences the owner's pet-related judgments and behaviors. For example, attesting to a strong tie between owners and their pets ([<a id="bib2up

Such knowledge would provide novel and important insights to marketers and allow them to develop marketing strategies based on pet exposure situations. For example, marketers might choose to recommend more fitting products or services or craft appropriate communication messages to effectively target consumers depending on the type of pets to which they are exposed. Consider the following scenario: A newly opened massage center is pondering the language to use in direct mail to potential customers and whether to focus on how its therapies help reduce fatigue and stress or how its therapies promote metabolism and energy levels. Which strategy might be more effective if the company features a cat (dog) figure in its advertisement? This article provides a theory-based answer to this question.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In our research, we focus on the effects of exposure to pets (e.g., recalling consumers' past interactions with dogs or cats, viewing ads featuring a dog or a cat) and examine how such experience influences consumers' judgments and decision making through the lens of regulatory focus theory. Drawing from literature on human–animal relationships, research on regulatory orientation, and work on mindset, we suggest that exposure to pets will remind consumers of the stereotypical personality traits, temperaments, and behaviors of the pets and thus will evoke different regulatory mindsets among consumers. Specifically, we predict and find that exposure to dogs fosters a more promotion-focused motivational mindset whereas exposure to cats activates a more prevention-focused motivational mindset. We further identify pet stereotypicality as a moderator for our findings, such that our results on the relationship between pet exposure and regulatory orientations persist only when consumers are reminded of the stereotypical temperaments and behaviors of the pet species, and that our main proposed effects dissipate when consumers are reminded of information inconsistent with the pet stereotypes. Moreover, we show that these regulatory mindsets, when activated by pet exposure, carry over to influence downstream consumer judgments, purchase intentions, and behaviors, even in pet-unrelated consumption contexts.</p><a id="AN0158338733-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-2" title="Theoretical Framework">Theoretical Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338733-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-3" title="Regulatory Orientation and Its Social Origin">Regulatory Orientation and Its Social Origin</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regulatory focus theory suggests that consumer judgments, decisions, and behaviors are motivated by two regulatory orientations: promotion and prevention focus (Higgins 1997; Lee, Aaker, and Gardner 2000; Pham and Avnet 2004; Wang and Lee 2006). A promotion focus in self-regulation reflects consumers' motivations to attain growth and nurturance in an effort to align their actual selves with their ideal selves (achieving accomplishments and fulfilling aspirations; Higgins 1987, [28]). Promotion-focused consumers are characterized by an eagerness regulatory system during behavioral regulation (Crowe and Higgins 1997; Lee, Keller, and Sternthal 2010; Pham and Chang 2010; Wang and Lee 2006). For example, they are sensitive to the presence or absence of positive outcomes (gains and successes; Higgins 1997), concerned about reducing errors of omission (Croe and Higgins 1997), and more risk seeking when processing information and rendering decisions (Zhou and Pham 2004). By contrast, self-regulation with a prevention focus reflects consumers' motivations to attain safety and security in an attempt to bring their actual selves into alignment with their "ought" selves (fulfilling duties and obligations; Higgins 1987, [28]). Thus, prevention-focused consumers are more vigilant and cautious during behavior regulation (Crowe and Higgins 1997; Lee, Keller, and Sternthal 2010; Pham and Chang 2010; Wang and Lee 2006). In this system, consumers are sensitive to the presence or absence of negative outcomes (losses and failures; Higgins 1997), concerned about reducing errors of commission (Crowe and Higgins 1997), and more risk averse (Zhou and Pham 2004) when processing information and making decisions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More germane to our research is the finding that social influences play a pivotal role in shaping people's regulatory orientations. For example, interactions with childhood caretakers and parents' parenting style can influence the formulation of consumers' regulatory orientations during the socialization process (Crowe and Higgins 1997; Higgins 1996). Social exclusion causes a shift toward prevention motivation (Park and Baumeister 2015), whereas making choices for other people instigates a promotion focus ([59]). In addition, distinct social relationships can activate alternative regulatory orientations, such that reminders of friends activate a promotion focus while reminders of family members engender a prevention focus ([22]). Similarly, positive role models induce a promotion focus, whereas negative role models instigate a prevention focus (Lockwood, Jordan, and Kunda 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given pets' prevalence in consumers' daily lives, we posit that consumers' interactions with pets are also an important part of socialization that can influence their regulatory orientations. These socialization activities can involve direct or indirect interactions with pets (e.g., observing pets' interactions with other people). Indeed, research on human–animal relationships evinces that pets play an important part in people's socialization process, influencing the development of various cognitive and social abilities (e.g., worldviews, empathy; [<a id="bib2up

Despite within-species breed differences, research on animal behavior has identified systematic cross-species differences between domesticated dogs and cats ([11], [12]; Jardim-Messeder et al. 2017). This stream of research suggests that a promotion-oriented eagerness system better captures dogs' temperaments and behavioral characteristics, whereas a prevention-focused cautious system better describes cats' temperaments and behavioral characteristics. For example, on a temperament level, dogs tend to be open and expressive, while cats are elusive and cautious ([11], [12]; Potter and Mills 2015). Consistent with the promotion orientation's receptivity to change (Boldero and Higgins 2011; [43]), dogs (vs. cats) cope better with and adapt quicker to changes in the environment, such as moving into a new house or having a new person in the household ([11], [12]; Langenfeld 2020). In line with the prevention orientation's preference for the status quo ([10]; Chernev 2004), cats (vs. dogs) appear more concerned with the protection their owners provide and the consistency and stability of their social and physical surroundings ([11], [12]). Similarly, consistent with the eagerness prediction of a promotion regulatory system ([15]), dogs are more responsive to rewards (e.g., food, praise, petting) than cats and thus are easier to train ([49]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When interacting with human beings and other pets, dogs are more eager to please their owners and socialize with other dogs, whereas cats are more cautious, suspicious, boundary setting, and anxious when surrounded by unfamiliar people or other cats ([11], [12]; Potter and Mills 2015). Indeed, research has shown that dogs are more attentive and responsive to human's social cues (e.g., gestures) than cats ([49]; Wynne, Udell, and Lord 2008). Dogs' eagerness can be exemplified by the spike in oxytocin (a hormone mammals release when they feel love or affection for someone) when their owners are around ([53]). A study conducted by scientists at BBC shows that dogs produce five times more oxytocin than cats upon seeing their owners ([21]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We further predict that through repeated socialization episodes with pets (through either direct or indirect interaction with pets), the traits and motivational characteristics of dogs (cats) are gradually associated with a promotion-focused (prevention-focused) eagerness (cautiousness) system. These learned associations are brought to mind and thus accessible when consumers interact with pets or encounter stimuli featuring pets (e.g., ads) in their daily lives. To confirm the associations of dogs and cats with promotion and prevention orientations, we conducted a pilot study, which found that participants indeed associated promotion-focused words with dogs and prevention-focused words with cats (for details of the pilot study, see Web Appendix A).</p><a id="AN0158338733-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-5" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing from research on motivational mindset, which we review next, we further predict that exposure to dogs (cats) or stimuli featuring them (e.g., ads) will remind consumers of the temperaments and behaviors of the dogs (cats), which will in turn activate a promotion-focused (prevention-focused) mindset among consumers and guide their subsequent judgment and decision making. Mindset reflects "the activation and use of a procedure that is stored in memory as part of declarative knowledge" ([76], p. 110). That is, engaging in a particular operation when pursuing a goal in a prior task may give rise to a mindset (e.g., a promotion-focused mindset) that remains accessible in consumers' memory and, in turn, guides their pursuit of a different goal in a subsequent, unrelated context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A growing body of literature has found considerable evidence of the role of mindset across a wide range of information-processing activities, from comprehension, to judgment, to decision making (Ma and Roese 2014; Wyer and Xu 2010; Xu et al. 2020). In some situations, mindsets involve cognitive procedures induced by engaging in a prior task that spills over to influence a subsequent, unrelated context. For example, Xu et al. (2020) show that managers during election years are more likely to adopt a comparative mindset due to the omnipresence of comparative political advertisements. Accordingly, they spend more money on their managerial decisions because the comparative mindset accentuates "which option to spend money on" and forgoes the "whether or not to spend" consideration. More germane to our theorizing, mindsets may also be based on motivation ([76]), such that the motivational mindset induced by pursuing a goal in a prior task will guide consumers' subsequent behavior in an unrelated context (e.g., pursuit of a different goal). For example, Wyer and Xu (2010) assert that the promotion (prevention) regulatory mindset can be induced procedurally by, for example, making salient participants' desire to achieve their ideal (ought) self. When activated, the promotion (prevention) regulatory mindset produces a cross-domain effect, making consumers, for example, more likely to approach positive (avoid negative) consequences in their decision making.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on this stream of literature, we posit that exposure to pets (e.g., recalling an interaction with a pet, viewing ads featuring a pet as the spokescharacter) in a prior task may render different regulatory mindsets salient. Specifically, because the stereotypical personality traits, temperaments, and behaviors of dogs (cats) brought to mind by the pet exposure are associated with eagerness (cautiousness) strategies commonly employed by a promotion (prevention) orientation, consumers' different regulatory orientations (promotion vs. prevention) will be activated. When evoked, these motivational regulatory mindsets will carry over to influence consumers' subsequent, unrelated judgments and decision making, rendering them more eager (cautious) during behavioral regulation, leading them to pursue promotion- (prevention-) focused goals such as growth and advancement (safety and stability), and making them more risk seeking (more risk averse) in decision making. Thus,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong>: Pet exposure activates different regulatory motivational mindsets among consumers, such that (a) exposure to dogs or dog-featuring stimuli (vs. cats or cat-featuring stimuli) activates a more promotion-focused mindset and (b) exposure to cats or cat-featuring (vs. dogs or dog-featuring) stimuli activates a more prevention-focused mindset.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A key premise of our theorizing that exposure to pets activates different regulatory mindsets is that such exposure will remind consumers of the stereotypical temperaments and behavioral characteristics of dogs (cats), giving rise to a promotion-focused (prevention-focused) mindset. In other words, through repeated socialization, consumers have developed preestablished mental connections between dogs' (cats') typical temperaments and behaviors and the promotion (prevention) focus, and exposure to pets or pet-featuring stimuli can render these stereotypical associations accessible, thus activating the corresponding regulatory-focus mindset among consumers. Prior research has shown that established mental associations are likely to be temporarily weakened, nullified, or even reversed when presented with information inconsistent with the original associations. For example, Gorn, Jiang, and Johar (2008) reversed the association between baby-faceness and unintentionality by presenting counterassociation information about a baby-faced person intentionally harming others. Thus, if our reasoning that mental associations between dogs (cats) and promotion- (prevention-) focused mindsets is right, our proposed effects should persist to the extent consumers are reminded of the stereotypical behaviors and temperaments of the pet species; when consumers are reminded of pet information inconsistent with the stereotypes of the species (e.g., dogs [cats] unlike a stereotypical dog [cat]), we are likely to show that our results are attenuated. More formally,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>H<sub>2</sub></strong>: Pet stereotypicality moderates the effect of pet exposure on regulatory mindsets, such that the effect dissipates when consumers are exposed to pets that are inconsistent with the stereotypes of the species.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expect that the impact of pet exposure on consumers' motivational mindsets will carry over to influence downstream variables, including ad evaluation, purchase intention, and real purchasing behavior, even in pet-unrelated consumption contexts. We anticipate that the effects of pet exposure on these variables will stem from the activation of a regulatory mindset and regulatory fit. Regulatory fit occurs when the regulatory strategies individuals employ during goal pursuit are compatible with their regulatory orientations (Higgins 2000; Hong and Lee 2007); it usually results in favorable effects on downstream consumer responses, such as enhanced value of the product ([<a id="bib7up

Specifically, using secondary data gathered from the American Veterinary Medical Association, Google Trends, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Study 1 finds that people in states with a higher percentage of dog (cat) owners search more promotion- (prevention-) focused words (Study 1a) and show a higher COVID-19 transmission rate (Study 1b). Study 2 shows that dog (vs. cat) owners are more likely to invest in stocks and are less likely to invest in mutual funds in financial decision making. Studies 3a–3d establish the basic effect that exposure to dogs (cats) activates a promotion- (prevention-) focused motivational mindset by employing multiple experimental manipulations of pet exposure and different measures of regulatory orientation in both pet-related and pet-unrelated contexts, including incentive-compatible choices. Study 4 explores a moderating effect for our findings, showing that our hypothesized effects will dissipate when consumers are exposed to pet information inconsistent with the stereotypes of the pet species. Study 5 examines the downstream effects of pet exposure on consumers' incentive-compatible behaviors, showing that consumers exposed to dogs (cats) bid higher for products framed with a promotion (prevention) focus. Studies 6 and 7 provide additional support for our theorizing by examining the mediation effect of regulatory fit.

Given its viable role in monitoring public interests, Google Trends has become an increasingly used data source for research in psychology ([46]), political sciences (Mellon 2013; Weeks and Southwell 2010), and marketing (Du, Hu, and Damangir 2015; Kozinets, Patterson, and Ashman 2017).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To build the state-level regulatory orientation index, we first selected ten representative promotion-focused words (i.e., "growth," "gain," "achievement," "aspiration," "pleasure," "proud," "hope," "earn," "win," and "spontaneous") and ten representative prevention-focused words (i.e., "privacy," "safety," "loss," "prevention," "pain," "stable," "saving," "frugal," "rules," and "risky"), in line with literature on regulatory focus (Higgins 1997, [29], [30]; Scholer, Cornwell, and Higgins 2019). We then obtained search interest scores of these words on Google Trends from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, across the 48 continental states plus the District of Columbia. For each state, we calculated the average search interest score for the ten promotion-focused words (α = .85) and the ten prevention-focused words (α = .74). Finally, we built a regulatory orientation index for each state by dividing the promotion search interest score by the prevention search interest score (i.e., higher numbers indicate a higher promotion focus).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To demonstrate the ecological validity of our findings, we also controlled for state-level microeconomic influence (income), macroeconomic influence (gross domestic product [GDP]), and political orientations.

Unlike Study 1, which used aggregate, state-level data, Study 2 relies on individual-level pet ownership data. In addition, we used an established measure of regulatory orientation ([65]), which involved participants in a financial decision-making task choosing between two investment options: stock (a proxy for promotion focus) and mutual fund (a proxy for prevention focus).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We recruited 145 pet owners from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (M<sub>age</sub> = 35.3 years; 53.1% female; 53% dog owners and 47% cat owners). We recruited only participants who own dogs only or cats only; owners of both dogs and cats were excluded (for the screening criteria, see Web Appendix E). We asked participants to partake in a financial decision-making task, which served as our measure of regulatory orientation (Zhou and Pham 2004). We first gave them basic definitions of stocks and mutual funds and told them that stock investments were typically associated with a higher level of risk, whereas mutual fund investments were typically associated with a lower level of risk and therefore more conservative. Next, we asked participants to imagine that they had $2,000 and were considering investing in two assets: a stock and a mutual fund. Afterward, we asked them to indicate which asset they would invest in if they could choose only one asset and then to indicate the amount of money they would invest. Given that prior research has shown that the activation of a promotion- (vs. prevention-) focused mindset entails greater risk taking (vs. risk aversion; Zhou and Pham 2004), we expected that dog (vs. cat) owners would be more willing to take risks in their financial investments and choose the stock option. After the financial decision-making task, participants completed measures of their mood using PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule; Watson, Clark, and Tellegen 1988) and a few demographic measures, including their age, gender, ethnicity, and income level (Web Appendix F presents the measures used).</p><a id="AN0158338733-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-12" title="Results">Results</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A logistic regression showed a significant effect of pet ownership (cat owners = 0, dog owners = 1) on investment choice, such that dog owners (36.4%) were more likely to choose to invest in the riskier stock option than cat owners (20.6%; b = .79, SE = .38, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.73, <em>p</em> = .039, Exp (B) = 2.20).

Specifically, in Study 3a, consumers preferred the ad with promotion-focused (prevention-focused) benefits for a dog (cat) toothpaste product. In Studies 3b–3d, we extended this finding to pet-unrelated domains. In Studies 3b and 3c, consumers exposed to dogs (vs. cats) were more willing to take risks in their decisions. In Study 3d, exposure to dogs (vs. cats) prompted consumers to prefer a vitamin brand with promotion-focused benefits. These findings provide converging support for our basic prediction that in both pet-related and pet-unrelated contexts, exposure to dogs can activate more of a promotion-focused mindset, whereas exposure to cats can activate more of a prevention-focused mindset.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, in Studies 3a–3d, we found no systematic differences between the dog- and cat-exposure conditions in terms of mood, age, gender, ethnicity, income, and pet ownership.

Although some stimuli used in these studies may not be completely balanced (e.g., the pet pictures used in Study 3c may differ on certain dimensions, and the energy-boosting benefits of the vitamin seem less consequential than the cancer-risk-reducing benefits of the product in Study 3d), these studies taken together show convergent evidence for our main hypothesis and suggest that the proposed effect is robust across different contexts.</p><a id="AN0158338733-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-20" title="Study 4: Moderating Role of Pet Stereotypicality">Study 4: Moderating Role of Pet Stereotypicality</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The primary purpose of Study 4 is to examine the moderating effect of pet stereotypicality on the activation of regulatory-focus mindsets (H<sub>2</sub>).

Specifically, we show that pet exposure fosters divergent regulatory orientations among consumers, such that exposure to dogs activates a promotion-focused motivational mindset while exposure to cats activates a prevention-focused motivational mindset (Studies 1–3). In Study 4, we further show that this effect is moderated by pet stereotypicality, such that the effects of pet exposure on regulatory mindsets dissipate when consumers are reminded of a pet that is inconsistent with the stereotypes of the species. These regulatory mindsets, when activated by pet exposure, carry over to influence downstream pet-unrelated consumer judgments, purchase decisions, and behaviors through regulatory fit (Studies 5–7), even in pet-unrelated consumption contexts.</p><a id="AN0158338733-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-37" title="Theoretical Contributions">Theoretical Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it recognizes pets as an important source of social influence on consumers' judgments and behaviors (Cavanaugh, Leonard, and Scammon 2008; Hirschman 1994; Holbrook and Woodside 2008). Prior research on marketplace social influence has examined the contexts of consumer-to-consumer and marketer-to-consumer interactions (e.g., Argo, White, and Dahl 2006; Chan and Sengupta 2010; Duclos, Wan, and Jiang 2013; Lee and Shrum 2012; Mead et al. 2011; White and Argo 2011; White and Dahl 2006, [75]). As examples of consumer-to-consumer interactions, Duclos, Wan, and Jiang (2013) show that social exclusion prompts riskier financial decisions because interpersonal rejection heightens the instrumentality of money to obtain benefits in life; Lee and Shrum (2012) find that social exclusion can lead to conspicuous consumption or prosocial behavior. As an example of marketer-to-consumer interactions, Chan and Sengupta (2010) find that consumers who receive insincere flattery from marketers still form favorable implicit evaluations of the marketer, but their explicit evaluations of the marketer are negative. Beyond these human-to-human contexts, our research suggests that the context of pet–human interactions as a source of social influence can similarly affect consumers' motivations, judgments, and behaviors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our research diverges from extant literature on human–animal relationships by going beyond the immediate context of pet ownership and investigating how pet exposure affects the way people render subsequent pet-unrelated judgments and decisions. Prior research on the effects of human–animal relationships has mainly focused on the immediate context of pets and their owners, such as pet owners' health and psychological well-being ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref72" title="2">2</a>]), their awareness and protection of animal rights (Kidd, Kidd, and Zasloff 1995), and their relationship satisfaction with pets (Cavanaugh, Leonard, and Scammon 2008). Going beyond this immediate context between pets and their owners, we posit and find that exposure to pets or pet-featuring stimuli fosters divergent regulatory orientations, which in turn influence downstream pet-unrelated judgments and decisions in the consumption domain. We hope that this research will stimulate further research to gain a more nuanced understanding of the impact of human–animal relationships.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, prior research identifies several antecedent variables of regulatory focus, such as one's cultural background (Lee, Aaker, and Gardner 2000), impulse purchase ([65]), and choosing for oneself versus others ([59]). Most of these factors, however, are intrapersonal. Only recently have researchers begun exploring the interpersonal drivers of regulatory focus (e.g., social exclusion [Park and Baumeister 2015], reminders of friends vs. family members [Fei, You, and Yang 2020]). Contributing to this stream of research, we uncover a novel social source of regulatory orientation: exposure to pets. We find that dog exposure is associated with a promotion orientation, whereas cat exposure is associated with a prevention orientation. Additional research is necessary to further explore the social and interpersonal impact on people's regulatory orientation.</p><a id="AN0158338733-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-38" title="Practical Implications">Practical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our findings also offer novel implications to marketers. First, marketers should consider crafting their advertising messages differently or recommending different products and services when they target consumers depending on their pet exposure situations. For example, to enhance the effectiveness of their advertising appeals or communication messages, marketers should emphasize promotion-focused goals such as gains and nongains if they are targeting dog owners or after consumers are exposed to dogs or dog-featuring stimuli (e.g., after just watching an ad about dogs). Conversely, they should focus on prevention-focused goals such as losses and nonlosses if they are pursuing cat owners or after consumers who are exposed to cats or cat-featuring stimuli. Importantly, our findings show that this advice holds even when the advertised product or service has nothing to do with pets or pet products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our findings offer important insights into how to incorporate pets into marketing communications. Dogs and cats frequently appear in advertisements and marketing campaigns. For example, Subaru has been running the "Dog Tested, Dog Approved" campaign since 2009 (Subaru 2020), and Sainsbury's "Mog the Cat" campaign raised a great amount of attention during the 2015 Christmas season ([25]). One consideration factor, according to our findings, is the type of products or services being advertised. For products or services mainly perceived as promotion-focused (e.g., stock investment, sports cars), featuring dogs in the ad is likely to increase the ad's persuasiveness. For products or services deemed more prevention-focused (e.g., mutual fund investment, insurance), featuring cats may increase the ad's appeal. According to the findings of the pet stereotypicality study, a caveat is that marketers should ensure that stereotypical pet temperaments are made salient in the message (e.g., the eagerness [cautiousness] aspect of the dog [cat] should be highlighted). Otherwise, the intended effects of featuring pets in the ad may not be achieved.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, pet-related marketing strategies are especially relevant in today's big-data era, in which marketers likely know more about consumers, including which types of pets they own or interact with. For example, marketers could obtain consumers' pet exposure information from the pet-related products purchased, the YouTube pet videos watched, or the Instagram pet photos posted and use this data to decide what type of marketing information to highlight. Alternatively, census information can provide marketers with an aggregated level of information about pets, as certain states or zip codes may have a higher concentration of dog (cat) owners. Marketers could use this information to determine the design of regional marketing campaigns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Lastly, our findings that pets and pet ownership are potentially related to COVID-19 transmission rate and prevention behaviors could shed new light on policies related to prevention of COVID-19 and potentially other infectious diseases. For example, policy makers in states with more dog owners could design more customized educational programs and materials related to the diseases. Alternatively, when designing ads to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, cats could be incorporated as a spokesperson and/or their temperaments can be referenced in the message to enhance the effectiveness of the ad.</p><a id="AN0158338733-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338733-39" title="Future Research Directions">Future Research Directions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research indicates that pets can exert a strong social influence on consumers. Future research could examine the strength of the influence of pets versus people on consumer behavior. On the one hand, one may argue that pets' influence on consumers is weaker than other human influences, because people are more influenced by similar others ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=8&amp;sid=2f60404b-593b-4720-b9c3-ac09e9840d42%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref76" title="3">3</a>]; Bandura 2002). On the other hand, it is also possible that pets may occasionally exert a stronger influence, especially considering that many pet owners admit that they prefer spending time with their pets over other people ([56]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another possible research direction is to examine other differences between dog and cat exposure. For example, exposure to dogs may be more likely to lead to conspicuous consumption than cat exposure. This follows because many people likely perceive dogs (vs. cats) as less seclusive and more social. Along similar lines, research could examine the different effects of dog versus cat stimuli. For example, using a dog (cat) as a spokescharacter can increase a brand's perceived excitement. Although our research focuses on examining the effect of pet exposure on consumers' regulatory orientations, future research could investigate the reverse relationship of whether promotion- (prevention-) focused consumers are more likely to adopt a dog (cat) or prefer dog- (cat-) related stimuli.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research could also examine additional moderators for our findings. One example is pet anthropomorphism, or people's tendency to assign human characteristics to pets ([<a id="bib2up

One prediction is that our findings that dog (cat) exposure evokes a promotion (prevention) orientation would be more salient among consumers who engage in pet anthropomorphism, because these consumers are more likely to be influenced by the pets. Another possible moderator is the role of culture. We conducted our studies primarily with American participants, and the United States is a culture in which the majority of people treat their pets as friends and family members (Sanders and Hirschman 1996).
