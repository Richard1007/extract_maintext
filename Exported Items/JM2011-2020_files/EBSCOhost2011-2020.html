However, evidence from extant research raises doubt as to whether this form of recognition matters in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Using a demand shock conceptualization to capture the signaling role and demand uncertainty of such recognition, this research argues that third-party recognition for design excellence does create firm value in B2B markets. The effect varies, however, depending on certain types of chief executive officer functional experience (market and finance) and the criteria used by third parties in judging design superiority. Modelfree evidence and matched-sample analysis provides empirical evidence in support of the demand shock perspective and the hypothesized effects. The research adds a new theoretical conceptualization describing the impact of thirdparty recognition for design excellence and unveils several new research areas. Managerially, the results identify several new facilitating conditions that enable B2B firms to create greater value from an innovation strategy based on superior design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online Supplement: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.15.0150">http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.15.0150</a></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Product design is a critical aspect of the innovation process and involves the configuration of a firm’s product offering (Dahl 2011; Ulrich 2011). Belief in the importance of good design can be found in discussions by chief executive officers (CEOs) who suggest that “good design will become the price of entry” (Brown 2005) and in business press articles stating, “At the Forefront of the Economy, Good Design Is a Priority” (Safian 2013, p. 26). A more nuanced perspective suggests that good design is a “necessary, but not sufficient” (Martin 2011, p. 243) condition for success and “not an unfailing recipe for business success” (Cantamessa 1999, p. 305). Understanding when design creates more or less value for a firm is important because of the significant investments required by a firm to produce a superiorly designed product (Kouvelis and Mukhopadhyay 1995).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has suggested that third-party recognition for design excellence is a factor influencing the success of products with a superior design (e.g., Chen, Liu, and Zhang 2012). This form of recognition consists of judgments by independent third parties regarding a product’s design superiority. Its impact is considered a result of the recognition’s ability to signal product quality (e.g., Reddy, Swaminathan, and Motley 1998) and the overall innovative capability of a firm (e.g., Xia, Singhal, and Zhang 2016) to customers. Using a signaling theory framework, research has linked the recognition with firm performance measures including long-term sales growth (e.g., Guo 2010; Zhang, Yu, and Xia 2014) and firm value (e.g., Chen, Liu, and Zhang 2012; Xia, Singhal, and Zhang 2016).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While understanding of the topic has benefited from prior research, there has been a tendency to explore the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence in business-toconsumer (B2C) markets such as movies (e.g., Chen, Liu, and Zhang 2012), automobiles (e.g., Balasubramanian, Mathur, and Thakur 2005), and running shoes (e.g., Chen and Xie 2005), where a signaling theory conceptualization has been sufficient to explain the recognition’s impact. In contrast, the small body of research examining third-party recognition in business-tobusiness (B2B) markets has painted a less than favorable picture. Tippins and Kunkel (2006), for instance, examined the impact of Clio awards won by advertising agencies and found limited instances of a positive linkage between design recognition and firm value. Xia, Singhal, and Zhang (2016) recently took a different approach and examined the relative impact of third-party recognition for design excellence across B2B and B2C markets and found that the effect was much larger in B2C markets. These less than positive findings create a difficult situation for B2B marketers who are faced with the question of whether to make the significant financial, market, and technological investments required for creating designs that receive recognition from expert judges (Larsen and Lewis 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The purpose of this research is to provide clear and unambiguous insight for researchers and marketers regarding the implications of third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets. The objective is accomplished by addressing several limitations in prior research. First, this research focuses solely on B2B markets. Previously, Xia, Singhal, and Zhang (2016) showed that the impact of third-party recognition is higher in B2C markets. However, their research did not reveal whether the higher effect for B2C firms is relative to no effect for B2B firms or whether the effect in both B2C and B2B markets is significant and the B2C effect is simply larger. Results using event study analysis in our research provide evidence of a positive impact of third-party recognition for design excellence on firm value in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our research addresses a conceptual limitation associated with prior research and its reliance on signaling theory. According to a recent meta-analysis examining switching costs and purchasing behavior in both B2B and B2C markets (Pick and Eisend 2014), unlike in B2C markets, product quality perceptions play a much less significant role in B2B markets. Furthermore, research has suggested that switching costs and purchasing behavior in B2B markets are driven by a host of factors, only some of which are influenced by product quality (Blut et al. 2016). These findings reflect the complex nature of purchasing in B2B markets and cast doubt on the ability of signaling theory and its focus on product quality to explain the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To address this theoretical challenge, our research conceptualizes third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets from a demand shock perspective. Theoretically, a demand shock perspective focuses attention on both a buyer’s reaction to third-party recognition for design excellence and a firm’s actions taken in anticipation of how buyers will respond to the recognition (Aggarwal and Wu 2015; Ahmadjian and Oxley 2013; Landsman, Nelson, and Roundtree 2009; Mitchell and Singh 1996; Tokar et al. 2014). Empirical findings based on a matched-sample analysis of 102 instances of third-party recognition for design excellence support the contribution of a demand shock perspective in accounting for the financial impact of this form of recognition in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conceptualization</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firm value is created when investors update their expectations positively about the level, timing, and riskiness of a firm’s cash flows (Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998). The primary means by which firms generate cash flow is through sales to existing and potential customers. In B2B markets, an important determinant of existing and new customer purchasing is a buyer’s perception of the switching costs associated with terminating and/or creating an exchange relationship with a supplier (Pick and Eisend 2014). Prior research has identified three types of these switching costs as being influential in B2B markets: (<a id="bib1up

A demand shock represents a sudden and unexpected shift in demand due to an exogenous event (Tokar et al. 2014). In line with the definition of a demand shock, third-party recognition for design excellence often occurs suddenly when independent third parties release their judgments to the public; the exact timing of which is often unknown a priori. In addition, the outcome of these judgments is unexpected (or at least uncertain) and exogenous because it is based on the actions of independent judges whose judgments are outside of the firm’s influence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The literature suggests the demand shock associated with third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets occurs at a firm level and as a result of the publicity associated with the recognition. Prior research has studied demand shocks in B2B markets at both industry and firm levels of analysis. Past examples of industry-level demand shocks in B2B markets include the attacks of September 11 (Aggarwal and Wu 2015), changes in economic conditions (Ahmadjian and Oxley 2013), regulatory changes (Landsman, Nelson, and Roundtree 2009), and changes in industry standards (Mitchell and Singh 1996).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Demand shocks also occur in B2B markets at a firm level through the impact of exogenous events on a focal firm. For instance, when Samsung suddenly recalled and stopped production of the Note 7 because of a faulty battery, a demand shock was created for suppliers such as Qualcomm, which provided materials for the manufacture of the Note 7 (Shah 2016). Publicity associated with third-party recognition can also create a demand shock, as described by Sajeel Hussain, chief marketing officer at Cafe´X, a company that sells robotic cafe kiosks to food and beverage retailers. Mr. Hussain describes the impact of third-party recognition on demand for the firm’s products in the following manner: “Do not underestimate the power of industry awards: When Cafe´X was formed in late 2013, nobody knew much about us until we won the Best of Show award at Enterprise Connect 2014. That changed everything for us and we received immediate endorsement from the industry, which gave us the air cover to seek new partnerships and client relationships that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible” (Hussain 2016).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A demand shock perspective also can account for the demand uncertainty that is likely to characterize third-party recognition for design excellence. Demand uncertainty characterizes the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence for two reasons. The first reason relates to the role of product quality in B2B switching costs and purchasing. Procedural switching costs are partially driven by search costs associated with finding a high-quality supplier (Blut et al. 2016). Third-party recognition creates a ranking of firms in an industry that reduces search-related procedural costs associated with switching to a recognized firm by its potential customers. Likewise, the quality signal can positively affect the brand aspect of relational switching costs that are based on brand spillover effects such as those that occur in cobranding strategies (Helm and O¨ zergin 2015), making it less likely that existing customers will switch from a recognized firm. However, while third-party recognition can positively affect quality-related switching costs in favor of a recognized firm, the importance of these switching costs is uncertain; research has suggested that quality perceptions are not necessarily a critical factor affecting purchasing behavior in B2B markets (Pick and Eisend 2014).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second reason for expecting that demand uncertainty will characterize third-party recognition is that the recognized firm lacks complete information about those switching costs that are unrelated to product quality. For instance, B2B exchange re</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">lationships tend to be long term, and this creates the opportunity for employees from each firm to develop personal relationships (e.g., Lian and Laing 2007). Breaking these personal bonds creates relational switching costs that are often unknown to those outside of the exchange relationship. Similarly, a recognized firm will have little knowledge of contract-based financial switching costs that are driven by the financial costs of breaking existing buyer–supplier contracts (Blut et al. 2016). Contract length and termination costs can vary widely across buyer–supplier relationships and are often unknown to those outside an exchange relationship because of confidentiality agreements and/or business norms (Hobbs 2016; Snell 2007). The lack of knowledge in these areas creates uncertainty regarding how buyers will react to a firm receiving third-party recognition for design excellence, making it difficult for a recognized firm to gauge the magnitude and timing of thirdparty recognition’s impact on demand in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The demand shock literature recognizes the demand uncertainty that can characterize a demand shock like third-party recognition for design excellence by focusing attention on “bracing” activities firms undertake in trying to anticipate how to respond to the shock. Research has shown that the bracing activity of B2B firms varies in effectiveness. Aggarwal and Wu (2015), for instance, demonstrated that some B2B firms were able to more effectively reshuffle their product portfolio in anticipation of the demand effect 9/11 had on armament purchases by the U.S. federal government. Ineffective bracing activity often occurs as a result of a firm over- or underreacting in response to the demand uncertainty associated with a demand shock. For example, Tokar et al. (2014) reported a tendency of firms in a B2C context to be overly aggressive in building-up excess inventory in response to a demand shock (Tokar et al. 2014). There are reasons to expect that the same mismanagement occurs in B2B markets based on research revealing a tendency of B2B firms to react suboptimally to demand uncertainty by under- or overestimating demand (Dearden, Lilien, and Eunsang 1999).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The preceding discussion suggests that third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets can be viewed from a demand shock perspective on the basis of the sudden nature of its occurrence, its potential to quickly affect B2B demand, and the uncertainty associated with its demand impact in B2B markets. In addition to capturing the demand-side aspect of third-party recognition for design excellence, the demand shock perspective also captures the supply-side dimension associated with bracing activity undertaken by firms in anticipation of the demand effect the recognition will cause. It draws attention to the possibility that a firm’s reaction to the recognition can be biased as a result of demand uncertainty characterizing its effect. In the next section, we use this conceptualization to hypothesize the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence on firm value and hypothesize boundary conditions influencing its impact. Figure 1 outlines our hypothesized model.</p><a id="AN0128990187-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-2" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several factors provide a basis for expecting third-party recognition for design excellence will result in greater firm value for firms receiving the recognition. One reason relates to the impact of switching costs on customer loyalty (Han and Sung 2008; Lam et al. 2004). Higher customer loyalty protects a firm’s sales and cash flow, and this increases firm value by lowering the riskiness of the firm’s cash flow (Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998). Third-party recognition should lead to higher customer loyalty because it increases procedural and relational switching costs for existing customers. Procedural switching costs related to search are higher for existing customers of a recognized firm because the recognition makes it more difficult for existing customers to find a supplier with quality superior to that of the recognized firm. Relational switching costs related to brand relationships are also higher for a recognized firm’s existing customers because the recognition increases the possibility of positive brand spillover effects from the recognized firm’s brand to the existing customer’s brand, making it costly for existing customers to break the brand relationship by switching to another supplier. In addition to promoting less risky cash flow through higher customer loyalty, the higher switching costs for existing customers will promote higher cash flow levels in the form of greater share of wallet and cross-buying (Blut et al. 2016).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third-party recognition should also affect switching costs of potential customers in ways that allow a recognized firm to generate new revenue streams through customer acquisition. For example, the recognition lowers procedural switching costs related to search for a recognized firm’s potential customers because the public nature of the recognition increases awareness by its potential customers of the recognized firm’s product superiority. The recognition also lowers relational switching costs associated with a recognized firm’s potential customers breaking their brand relationships with their current supplier because of the potential positive brand spillover effects that can come as a result of the brands of potential customers being associated with the recognized firm’s brand. The lower switching costs experienced by a recognized firm’s potential customers should promote firm value by supporting customer acquisition and new revenue streams from potential customers (Blut et al. 2016). This could happen even when the product is in a mature category with the award drawing attention to the design excellence of the product and making it salient.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1: Third-party recognition for design excellence creates value in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The preceding discussion suggests B2B firms will experience an expected positive shift in demand from third-party recognition for design excellence due to its positive impact on the procedural switching costs related to search costs and the relational switching costs related to brand relationships. However, the magnitude and timing of the demand shift can be uncertain because of the influence of additional switching costs about which less is known. For example, there will be uncertainty about relational costs from broken personal bonds and financial costs from prematurely terminated contracts that are unique to exchange relationships. This demand uncertainty could lead to mishandling of the demand shock by the recognized firm through a bracing response that is either too safe or too risky (e.g., Dearden, Lilien, and Eunsang 1999; Tokar et al. 2014). What can prevent mishandling of the sales opportunity presented by third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets? Recent research focusing on strategic decision making, in general (Maitland and Sammartino 2015), and demand shocks, specifically (Tokar et al. 2014), has suggested that the availability of task-related information plays a large role in reducing the biasing effects of uncertainty on decision making.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One important form of task-related information is functional experience reflecting the experience accumulated in the performance of an organizational task. We focus on CEO functional experience on the basis of anecdotal evidence suggesting that CEOs recognize the importance of third-party recognition for design excellence and actively respond to the recognition. Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, for instance, responded to the Bowflex receiving an award for design excellence by describing the recognition as “an incredible honor and testament to the efforts of our entire product design team” (Business Wire 2014). As such, we expect that CEOs will play an influential role in a firm’s response to third-party recognition for design excellence and that their functional experience will provide insight that can reduce demand uncertainty and allow for more effective bracing activity. The types of CEO functional experiences explored include experience related to markets and finance. These types were chosen because of the insight each type of experience provides relative to B2B switching costs that can create demand uncertainty in the presence of third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><a id="AN0128990187-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-3" title="CEO Market Experience">CEO Market Experience</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Chief executive officers vary in their market experience to the extent that they have previously worked in marketing-related and sales-related positions (Hui, Morgan, and Rego 2015). As CEOs gain market-related experience, their knowledge of existing and potential customers’ procedural, financial, and relational switching costs increases. This insight should reduce the demand uncertainty characterizing the recognition and lead to more effective bracing activity. One reason for expecting CEO market experience to be important is that through marketing activity like market research and market segmentation, CEOs acquire general market knowledge related to brands and products (Homburg and Jensen 2007). This information can aid in understanding relational switching costs related to brand relationships. Similarly, sales experience provides insight into the personal nature of exchange relationships, lending insight into the relational switching costs associated with relationships between a buyer’s and supplier’s employees (Johnson, Sohi, and Grewal 2004). In addition, a CEO’s knowledge gained through advertising and related promotional activities provides insight into the search dimension of procedural switching costs (Holak and Reddy 1986).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A CEO’s knowledge gained through past sales efforts to acquire new customers will provide the recognized firm with insight into the financial and relational switching costs for its potential customers. A CEO’s experience in sales activity can also involve working with customers postpurchase to ensure that they experience value from their relationship with a supplier (Burger and Cann 1995). This experience provides a CEO with insight into the adoption aspect of procedural switching costs associated with buyers’ use of a supplier’s product. Thus, the market-related functional experience of a firm’s CEO provides an important information source that can reduce the uncertainty associated with various forms of B2B switching costs, increasing the likelihood that the firm will effectively respond to the demand shock accompanying third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2: A firm creates greater (vs. less) value from third-party recognition for design excellence when its CEO has more (vs. less) functional experience related to markets.</p><a id="AN0128990187-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-4" title="CEO Finance Experience">CEO Finance Experience</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The finance function focuses on effectively managing a firm’s cash flows through financial instruments like equity and debt (Proctor 2014). Experience in finance provides a CEO with various forms of knowledge that provide insight into potential customers’ switching costs in B2B markets. One form of knowledge is contract knowledge gained through participation in financial negotiations with buyers. Business-to-business purchases are often large-volume purchases that involve extended financial negotiations related to payment terms and the provision of trade credit to buyers (Geiger 2017). The knowledge gained through this form of financial experience will provide insight into the financial switching costs associated with terminating contracts. In addition, experience in finance provides a CEO with knowledge related to financial policies, such as inventory cost management, and their value in decision making (Custodio and Metzger 2014). This information can enable CEOs to better understand how past investments can influence procedural switching costs associated with the adoption of a supplier’s product. Chief executive officers with experience in finance will also have a better understanding of switching costs involving personal relationships on the basis of their experience working with clients’ purchase departments as well as the investment community, where personal relationships play an important role (Andrews and Welbourne 2000). These different sources of knowledge a CEO acquires through experience in finance should lessen a firm’s uncertainty regarding the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence on B2B switching costs and allow the firm to best leverage the demand shock.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3: A firm creates greater (vs. less) value from third-party recognition for design excellence when its CEO has more (vs. less) functional experience in finance.1</p><a id="AN0128990187-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-5" title="Design Excellence Criteria">Design Excellence Criteria</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The criteria used by third parties when making their judgments of design excellence may include design dimensions related to function, form, or both function and form. These criteria can affect the importance of CEO functional experience by influencing the nature of the demand shock associated with third-party recognition. Specifically, design criteria based on both function and form should dampen the immediate demand shock through a slower purchase deliberation process and less new customer acquisition relative to designs focused on only one design dimension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One reason for expecting a slower B2B buying decision for designs based on both function and form versus buying decisions for designs based on form or function is related to price. Designs excelling in both function and form will be priced higher because suppliers will need to recoup the higher investments required to excel in both function and form (Kouvelis and Mukhopadhyay 1995; Larsen and Lewis 2007). The higher price will increase the importance of the purchase to buyers because of its greater impact on a buying firm’s financial outlay for supplies, cost structure, and profitability (Wathne, Biong, and Heide 2001). When making more important purchase decisions, firms tend to follow a more formalized buying process that can slow purchase decisions by adding complexity and conflict to the purchase process when the cost of acquired supplies is high (Lau, Goh, and Phua 1999; Pemer and Skjølsvik 2016). In addition, this can also dampen the likelihood of acquiring new customers, whose costs in switching from existing suppliers increase as a result of the aforementioned factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second reason for expecting a slower purchase process for designs emphasizing both function and form involves the financial risk associated with these types of designs. The higher price associated with designs achieving recognition for both function and form creates higher financial risk, which will motivate B2B buyers to consider more purchase criteria (Tullous and Munson 1992). The inclusion of more purchase criteria increases the amount of information search associated with a purchase and this can result in a longer duration for the purchase decision (Weiss and Heide 1993).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third factor to consider is the complexity associated with adopting designs emphasizing both function and form. Adopting and leveraging products excelling on both design dimensions will likely require buyers to develop more complex processes and systems relative to the processes and systems involved in adopting and leverage designs emphasizing only one design dimension. When faced with more complex purchasing decisions, firms generally create larger buying groups that allow for the input of people from across a firm whose knowledge can aid in decision making (Crow and Lindquist 1985). Identifying whose input should be considered, gathering the input, and using it to make a decision all require time, and this can slow down the purchase process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Taken together, the higher price, higher financial risk, and greater complexity associated with products excelling on both design dimensions versus one dimension should result in a slower B2B buying decision process than designs excelling on only one design criteria. The slower purchase process will limit the demand shock for products excelling on both design dimension relative to products excelling on one dimension. This will especially be the case with new buyers switching from their existing suppliers to the award-winning firm, thus damping the demand shock effect that occurs through new customer acquisition. As a result, the functional experience of CEOs and the insight it provides for managing the demand shock associated with third-party recognition for design excellence should make less of a difference when design criteria involve both function and form.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4: The positive impact of CEO functional experience related to markets on the value a firm creates from third-party recognition for design excellence is smaller when the criteria used in determining the recognition are based on both the function and form dimensions of design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5: The positive impact of CEO functional experience related to finance on the value a firm creates from third-party recognition for design excellence is smaller when the criteria used in determining the recognition are based on both the function and form dimensions of design.</p><a id="AN0128990187-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-6" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several methodological challenges arise when trying to examine the effect of third-party recognition for design excellence. The first challenge involves isolating the effect of third-party recognition, because many activities contribute to a product’s development and the eventual value it creates (Hertenstein, Platt, and Veryzer 2005). To overcome this challenge, we utilized the event study methodology originally developed in the finance literature (Brown and Warner 1980, 1985) and adopted by researchers within the marketing literature (e.g., Sorescu, Shankar, andKushwaha 2007; Wiles, Morgan, and Rego 2012). The event study methodology captures changes in investors’ expectations regarding the future cash flow of a firm experiencing an event. The event study enables us to measure the financial effect of third-party recognition after accounting for all other effects of the firm and the market (Brown and Warner 1985).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second challenge requires effectively identifying occurrences of recognition for design excellence by a third party. We address this challenge by analyzing awards granted by third parties for product design excellence. Awards for product design excellence are won through a competitive process that firms enter through their own application or by being nominated by another party. The judging of a product’s design excellence involves third-party experts involved in industrial design, marketing, and other areas related to product design. In some cases, customers also play a role in judging the superiority of product designs. Consistent with prior research (e.g., Guo 2010; Xia, Singhal, and Zhang 2016), we measure third-party recognition for product design excellence on the basis of a product winning a product design award.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third challenge involves testing the causal impact of the recognition and the factors proposed to moderate its effect. To address this challenge, we created a matched sample of “good” design firms not receiving third-party recognition for design excellence using procedures recommended in prior methodological research (e.g., Barber and Lyon 1996; Cram, Karan, and Stuart 2009). In the first step of the matching procedure, we sought potentialmatches within the same industry at a two-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) level. In the second step, we analyzed those firms sharing at least a two-digit SIC match with a firm recognized for design excellence, identifying potential matches as those with a market value within 10% of the recognized firm to find firms that are similar on our dependent variable (i.e., firmvalue). In the third step, we identified the nearest neighbor to the recognized firm based on research and development (R&amp;D)/sales. We used this lastmatching filter to account for factors associated with a firm’s ability and motivation to seek third-party recognition for design excellence. The choice of R&amp;D/sales for matching purposes is based on prior research linking R&amp;D investment with an emphasis on design (e.g., Hsu 2006). Finally, in step four, we verified that no information about the nearest-neighbor match identified in step three was released into the market on the same day the recognized firm received its recognition for its design excellence. This last step ensured that the only difference between the recognized firm and its match was third-party recognition of the former firm for design excellence. The matching procedure employed in the research is consistent with matching procedures used in prior research studying firm value in a variety of contexts related to this research, including marketing management (Mizik 2010) and innovation (Miller 2004).2</p><a id="AN0128990187-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-7" title="Sample">Sample</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We collected the sample used in testing the stated hypotheses by identifying all announcements of firms receiving a product design award that appeared in major daily newspapers and wire services such as the Wall Street Journal, PR Newswire, and Dow Jones Newswire between 1997 and 2014. This resulted in a sample of 369 third-party product design award announcements received by publicly traded firms. Our initial sample consisted only of publicly traded firms to accommodate the event study methodology and the research focus on the value implication of third-party recognition for design excellence. Firms in the initial sample were classified as B2B (vs. B2C) on the basis of their two-digit SIC codes, following prior research examining marketing activity in B2B markets3 (Srinivasan, Lilien, and Sridhar 2011).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following recommendations from the event study literature (e.g., McWilliams and Siegel 1997), we removed third-party product design award announcements that involved confounding events. For purposes of this study, a confounding event is an event within a three-day window around the focal event that may influence investors’ expectations of firm performance. Examples of confounding events include quarterly performance reports, alliance formations, and executive officer appointments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One concern is the possibility of self-selection (i.e., whether a firm applied for the award itself). We do not believe a selfselection issue characterizes our sample for several reasons. First, all the awards are based on the evaluation of third-party independent judges, and this prevents firms from being able to directly influence their selection for an award. Second, firms do not completely control whether they are considered for an award. An examination of our sample of awards reveals that third parties consider firms for an award through a nomination process that allows a firm to nominate itself and/or allows a third party (e.g., customer) to nominate the firm. We attempted to isolate those situations in which a firm nominated itself for an award; however, we were unable to identify any instances in which an award recognized whether a firm had self-nominated or been nominated by a third party. Third, we attempted to control for a firm’s motivation to apply for an award by including R&amp;D intensity when constructing a matched sample, recognizing that two firms would be more likely to apply for an award when they place a similar emphasis on R&amp;D. Fourth, our difference model controls for unobserved firm-specific effects that may be related to a firm’s motivation to apply for a design award but are not formally captured in our model.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also ensured that the recognition for design excellence (<a id="bib1up

The event study method estimates the abnormal movement in the stock price of a firm receiving thirdparty recognition for design excellence using the Fama–French four-factor model (i.e., the original Fama–French three-factor model with Carhart’s momentum factor) on the day the design excellence award is first announced.

Rtm captures the usual market factor in stock returns while SMBt and HMLt are meant to reflect risk factors related to size and book-to-market equity. The residual ARit represents a zero-mean abnormal portfolio return that is unexplained by common risk factors. We then use the estimates obtained from the model to calculate abnormal returns (ARs) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) by summing the individual ARs across time to account for information leakage before the event date or information dissemination after the event date. We followed prior research in obtaining the ordinary least squares parameter estimates using a 90-trading-day estimation window, ending six days before the focal event (e.g., Wiles, Morgan, and Rego 2012).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has recommended using a difference model when analyzing matched sample data (e.g., Cram, Karan, and Stuart 2009).

We measured the functional experience of CEOs related to markets and finance on the basis of their prior functional experience, following previous research in our measurement process (e.g., Barker and Mueller 2002; Hambrick and Mason 1984). Specifically, we created a set of dummy variables indicating whether a CEO had experience in any of eight functional areas including marketing, sales, engineering, human resources, legal, finance, operations, and R&amp;D. To accomplish the coding, two raters reviewed the biographical background of each CEO for a firm recognized for its design excellence and its matched counterpart to assess the presence or absence of each of the functional areas in a CEO’s background. The coders were first provided with a listing of roles associated with functional experience in marketing, sales, engineering, finance, R&amp;D, operations, legal, and human resources. The roles used to identify a CEO with functional experience related to markets included experience in roles involving marketing, advertising, branding, customer service, merchandising, media planning, sales, selling, business development, and account management. The roles used to identify a CEO with functional experience related to finance included experience roles involving finance, accounting, and bookkeeping and titles such as controller and treasurer.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The coders were then provided with biographies of CEOs for the recognized firms and control firms in the sample. We employed multiple sources in identifying CEO biographies, including firm documents (e.g., 10-Ks), executive profile databases (e.g., Bloomberg’s Executive Profiles and Biographies), and social media databases (e.g., LinkedIn). The coders were provided with a subsample of biographies (5%) and trained on classification of the biographies using the role listings provided to them. This process also identified and resolved questions regarding role-related information in the biographies, interpretation of titles, and assignment of titles using the classification. When there were no more training questions, coders were provided with the full sample of biographies and coded them. There was 98% agreement between the raters, and we resolved any discrepancies. The high level of coder agreement was credited to the extensive training they completed before classifying the full sample.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/119n1.jpg" alt="119n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 1 Measures"><em>TABLE: TABLE 1 Measures</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Conceptual Variables</th><th valign="top">Measures</th><th valign="top">Data Sources</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">CEO market experience</td><td valign="top">Percentage of a CEO’s functional experience in marketing and sales</td><td valign="top">10-Ks, DEF-14s, Bloomberg’s Executive Profiles and Biographies, LinkedIn</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CEO finance experience</td><td valign="top">Percentage of a CEO’s functional experience in finance</td><td valign="top">10-Ks, DEF-14s, Bloomberg’s Executive Profiles and Biographies, LinkedIn</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Design excellence criteria</td><td valign="top">Design excellence third-party recognition based on both functional and form aspects of design</td><td valign="top">Third-party recognition announcement, third-party website</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Firm prior awards</td><td valign="top">Number of design awards prior to third-party recognition for design excellence</td><td valign="top">Major daily newspapers and wire services</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Product age</td><td valign="top">Days since launch of product recognized fort design excellence</td><td valign="top">10-Ks, major daily newspapers and wire services</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Promotional intensity</td><td valign="top">SG&amp;A/total revenue</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Firm SOA</td><td valign="top">Revenue/total assets</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Industry environmental uncertainty</td><td valign="top">Coefficient from regressing five-year period of industry sales over time divided by average industry revenue</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Industry environmental munificence</td><td valign="top">Standard error from regressing five-year period of industry sales over time divided by average industry revenue</td><td valign="top">Compustat, 10-Ks</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Industry competitiveness</td><td valign="top">Herfindahl index based on industry revenue</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Award: consumer judge</td><td valign="top">Indicator variable: 1 = design excellence thirdparty recognition based on input from consumers; 0 otherwise</td><td valign="top">Third-party recognition announcement, third-party website</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Award: magazine sponsor</td><td valign="top">Indicator variable: 1 = sponsor of third-party recognition is a magazine; 0 otherwise</td><td valign="top">Third-party recognition announcement, third-party website</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CEO duality</td><td valign="top">1 if CEO is also Chair of the Board; 0 otherwise</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SIC 4-digit</td><td valign="top">Four-digit SIC code</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Market value</td><td valign="top">Stock price • common shares outstanding</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">R&amp;D intensity</td><td valign="top">R&amp;D investment/total revenue</td><td valign="top">Compustat</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Notes: SOA = sales on assets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We originally wanted to measure actual years for each functional experience. However, data reflecting the actual years of experience for each CEO in each area of work experience were not consistently available across CEOs. As an alternative, we measure each area of functional experience as the percentage of a CEO’s functional experience in that area relative to all areas of functional experience for the CEO. For instance, a CEO with functional experience related to markets, legal, and engineering would have a measure of .33 for market experience, while a CEO with functional experience only in markets would receive a value of 1.0 for market experience. This approach provides a method for determining the intensity of a CEO’s functional experience related to markets and finance versus other functional areas. The value for this measure ranges from 0 (no functional experience in an area) to 1 (all functional experience in an area) and varies between these extremes depending on the other areas of functional experience for a CEO. The way CEO functional experience is measured results in the measures being akin to seasonal dummies.

The variable was created on basis of the classification of two reviewers independent of the research. The two coders were provided definitions for function and form aspects of design based on definitions offered in prior research (e.g., Homburg, Schwemmle, and Kuehnl 2015). The definition provided to the coders for design function stated that function refers to the ability of a product to successfully perform a task and deliver on customer expectations in performing the task. The coders were also provided with examples of ways to describe design function that included descriptions of the product being “helpful,” “capable,” “sturdy,” and/or “practical” in its performance of a task. The definition provided to the coders for design form stated that form refers to the “look” or aesthetic appeal of the product and its features, including size (e.g., big, small), shape (e.g., round, wide) and packaging (e.g., creative, eye-catching). The coders were also provided with examples of ways to describe design form that included descriptions of the product as being “beautiful,” “appealing,” “elegant,” and “striking” in its appearance. We collected the design criteria for each award from information provided in each announcement and on the third party’s website. We provided a subsample (5%) from the full sample to the coders to train them on use of the criteria in classifying each award. Afterward, the coders were given the full sample to code. There was 82% agreement between the coders, and we resolved the remaining discrepancies.</p><a id="AN0128990187-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-11" title="Control Variables">Control Variables</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Factors other than the variables identified in the hypotheses may have an impact on investors’ reactions to a firm receiving thirdparty recognition for design excellence. At a firm level, the efficient market hypothesis suggests that changes in firm stock price are the result of investors reacting to new information about a firm. Given our focus on product design excellence, we accounted for the newness of design-related information by controlling for the number of prior design awards received by a firm for other products before the focal award examined in our analysis. We also recorded product age to account for the level of prior information investors had about a recognized product. We control for marketing by including a measure of promotional intensity based on a firm’s investment in sales, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) relative to its revenue. We account for the potential impact of prior performance on investor reaction to a superior product design by including a variable measuring sales on assets (sales/total assets). The model also controls for the influence of CEOs by measuring whether a CEO served as both CEO and chair of the board.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The research also controls for macroenvironmental factors. We control for environmental uncertainty and environmental munificence by using measures from prior research based on an analysis of industry sales (e.g., Boyd, Chandy, and Cunha 2010). We measure environmental uncertainty by regressing industry sales onto a five-year time period prior to a firm announcing its participation a trade show. The standard error from this regression is then standardized by the mean of industry sales over the fiveyear time period. Environmental munificence is measured using the same regression analysis of five-year industry sales and dividing the coefficient from the analysis by the mean of industry sales over the five-year time period. We account for the competitive nature of a recognized firm’s industry by including a measure of industry concentration using the Herfindahl index.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several aspects of a product design award may influence investor reaction to a firm winning an award. The judging varies in line with the identity of the third-party expert, which could lead to different performance impacts of an award (Gemser, Leenders, and Wijnberg 2008). All awards involved evaluations by industry experts, but there were awards that also included feedback from consumers. Drawing on prior research suggesting the influence of consumer word of mouth (Chakravarty, Liu, and Mazumdar 2010), we included a dummy variable indicating whether the judging included consumer feedback. The research also controls for the sponsor of the award by identifying those awards sponsored by a magazine to account for market exposure to the recognition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The last set of control variables account for possible concerns regarding the validity of our matching process. Cram, Karan, and Stuart (2009) empirically demonstrate that validity in matched-sample analysis is best established by recognizing the inexactness inherent in matching techniques and the potential of unobservable factors not accounted for by matching. Following their recommendation, we include difference measures for the variables used in creating the matched sample: industry SIC, market value, and R&amp;D intensity. Difference in industry SIC code was measured using a dummy where the value of 1 reflected an exact match at a four-digit level between a recognized firm in our sample and its matched counterpart; the measure was given a value of 0 otherwise. Differences in market value and R&amp;D intensity were measured between a firm recognized for design excellence and its matched counterpart.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/121n1.jpg" alt="121n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 2 Correlations and Descriptive Statistics"><em>TABLE: TABLE 2 Correlations and Descriptive Statistics</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">1</th><th valign="top">2</th><th valign="top">3</th><th valign="top">4</th><th valign="top">5</th><th valign="top">6</th><th valign="top">7</th><th valign="top">8</th><th valign="top">9</th><th valign="top">10</th><th valign="top">11</th><th valign="top">12</th><th valign="top">13</th><th valign="top">14</th><th valign="top">15</th><th valign="top">16</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">1.

For the first step of our analysis, we aimed to provide evidence of a demand shock being associated with third-party recognition for design excellence. We use the sample of recognized firms and compare their sales growth with that of their matched counterparts during each of the four quarters immediately following recognition. The benchmark for generating sales growth during each quarter subsequent to recognition is the quarter immediately preceding recognition. Table 3 reveals that only recognized firms experience any significant postrecognition sales growth, and this growth occurs only during the quarter immediately following their winning of an award. Nonrecognized firms do not experience any significant sales growth during the same period. It is important to note that there is a large range of values characterizing sales growth for recognized firms, suggesting that there is significant variation in the extent to which firms are able to generate more or less sales from the recognition. Furthermore, 56% of the sample experienced a positive return, while 44% of the sample experienced a negative return. This distribution aligns with our demand shock perspective. These results provide empirical evidence consistent with a demand shift for firms receiving third-party recognition for design excellence and provide support for a demand shock conceptualization.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/122n1.jpg" alt="122n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 3 Demand Shock Model-Free Evidence"><em>TABLE: TABLE 3 Demand Shock Model-Free Evidence</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">Mean</th><th valign="top">SD</th><th valign="top">p-Value (Mean 5 0)</th><th valign="top">Median</th><th valign="top">95% Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" colspan="6">Recognized Firms</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 1 = ln[qt + 1/qt - 1]*</td><td valign="top">3.95</td><td valign="top">24.86</td><td valign="top">.09</td><td valign="top">2.80</td><td valign="top">[-29.21, 88.05]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 2 = ln[(qt + 2)/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">4.99</td><td valign="top">36.95</td><td valign="top">.17</td><td valign="top">6.87</td><td valign="top">[-37.60, 46.44]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 3 = ln[(qt + 3)/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">6.43</td><td valign="top">40.98</td><td valign="top">.11</td><td valign="top">8.81</td><td valign="top">[-36.53, 59.38]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 4 = [ln(qt + 4/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">7.00</td><td valign="top">44.00</td><td valign="top">.11</td><td valign="top">11.88</td><td valign="top">[-44.09, 49.44]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="6">Nonrecognized Matched Sample Firms</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 1 = ln[(qt + 1)/(qt - 1)]*</td><td valign="top">2.34</td><td valign="top">27.29</td><td valign="top">.38</td><td valign="top">5.18</td><td valign="top">[-49.85, 34.27]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 2 = ln[(qt + 2)/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">3.62</td><td valign="top">37.51</td><td valign="top">.33</td><td valign="top">7.43</td><td valign="top">[-47.90, 43.63]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 3 = ln[(qt + 3)/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">4.07</td><td valign="top">36.68</td><td valign="top">.26</td><td valign="top">7.33</td><td valign="top">[-44.65, 50.38]</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales Growth Quarter 4 = [ln(qt + 4/(qt - 1)]</td><td valign="top">6.47</td><td valign="top">44.26</td><td valign="top">.15</td><td valign="top">10.36</td><td valign="top">[-65.37, 74.42]</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><a id="AN0128990187-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-15" title="Results">Results</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As Table 4 shows, third-party recognition for design excellence positively affects firm value on the day it is announced.

Table 5 provides the model statistics and the results from regressing the ARs from the event day onto the hypothesized variables and control variables included in the model. We also calculated the variance inflation factors for the variables in our model and found all variance inflation factors to be well below the recommended threshold of 10. The full model is significant and explains 31% of the variation in the abnormal stock return associated with a firm receiving third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2 focused on the impact of CEO market experience. The sign for the CEO market experience coefficient is positive (coefficient = .08) and significant (p &lt; .05). As a result, there is evidence in support of the importance of CEO market experience as a factor influencing the value a firm creates from receiving third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3 examined the effect of CEO experience related to finance. The positive (coefficient = .09) and significant (p &lt; .01) coefficient for finance experience provides support for H3. This finding illustrates the important contribution of CEO finance experience as a factor influencing investors’ expectations regarding the value creation opportunity provided by recognition for product design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4 and H5 argued that the positive effect of CEO market and finance experience is smaller when third-party recognition for design excellence is based on criteria that include both functional and form dimensions of design because of the slower purchase process associated with products emphasizing both design dimensions and the resulting dampened demand shock. The results support both H4 and H5 based on the negative and significant coefficient for the interaction term involving CEO market experience and design excellence criteria (coefficient = -.08; p &lt; .10) and the negative and significant coefficient for the interaction term involving CEO finance experience and design excellence criteria (coefficient = -.08; p &lt; .05).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, the results provide strong support for viewing third-party recognition for design excellence as a factor creating firm value in B2B markets. The results also support the influence of a CEO’s functional experience related to markets and finance on the value created from third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets. The significant impact of CEO functional experience highlights the importance investors assign to a firm’s anticipated reaction to recognition when evaluating the financial impact of third-party recognition for design excellence. In addition, the significant and negative interaction of functional experience with design excellence criteria provides empirical evidence demonstrating that management’s contribution depends on the level of sales opportunity created by third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><a id="AN0128990187-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-18" title="Robustness Checks">Robustness Checks</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We performed several forms of follow-up analysis to assess the robustness of the research findings. The first follow-up analysis involved testing the proposed model with alternative dependent variables. The original analysis used the difference in AR between each firm recognized by a third-party for design excellence and its matched counterpart as the dependent variable. This difference measure represents a novel approach to using ARs from an event study within marketing. To address concerns that our results are an artifact of the way we constructed the dependent variable, we created an alternative difference measure using one-day buy and hold returns on the event day for the recognized firms in our sample and their matched counterparts. The results from testing this alternative model are consistent with the original results (see Web Appendix B). As an additional robustness check related to our dependent variable, we also created a random sample of ARs for our recognized firms and their matched counterparts by randomly identifying a date within 60 days of the actual award event date. We calculated ARs for the random event date and the analysis rerun. None of the hypothesized findings from our original model replicate with the random sample of ARs (see Web Appendix C).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also aimed to ensure that findings related to CEO functional experience, in general, are not a by-product of the measure used for CEO functional experience by examining an alternative measure of the variables. As highlighted previously when discussing the measure of CEO functional experience, we originally sought to measure actual years for each functional experience. However, this was not possible because of missing data for multiple CEOs with respect to time spent in a particular function. Instead, the analysis measured each area of functional experience as the percentage of a CEO’s functional experience in that area relative to all areas of his or her functional experience. The robustness analysis aimed to validate that it is the intensity of functional experience and not simply the presence of experience that is important. We pursued this objective by creating a dummy variable equaling 1 if a CEO has experience in a functional area and 0 otherwise. The alternative approach led us to recode CEO market and finance functional experience, respectively, resulting in a binary indicator measure for each type of experience. None of the CEO functional variables are significant using this new indicator measure, confirming that it is the intensity of CEO functional experience that matters to investors (see Web Appendix D).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also explored whether the results from our analysis are sensitive to the presence of outliers. To do this, we Winsorized the data at 99% and reran the analysis. We were also sensitive to the possibility that our choice of a cutoff value for Winsorizing the data could potentially bias the results. Therefore, we also Winsorized the data at 95% and reran the analysis. The results are robust across both levels of Winsorization, suggesting that outliers are not influencing the results (see Web Appendix E).</p><a id="AN0128990187-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-19" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">With this research, we aimed to provide insight into the financial impact of third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets. To do so, we employed a demand shock conceptualization to account for possible reactions to the recognition. The research hypothesized a positive average effect across B2B markets and hypothesized CEO functional experience and the design criteria used by experts when determining design excellence as moderating factors. An event study method of analysis involving a matched sample and difference score regression analysis examining 102 incidences of design excellence awards received by B2B firms both provide strong support for the hypothesized model. Next, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings.</p><a id="AN0128990187-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-20" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One contribution of this article is the clarity and confidence it provides to the small body of research on third-party recognition for design excellence in B2B markets. Prior research on the topic created doubts regarding the effect of this form of recognition in B2B markets because of limited positive findings (e.g., Tippins and Kunkel 2006) and findings that showed lesser effects in B2B versus B2C markets (e.g., Xia, Singhal, and Zhang 2016). Our research addressed these empirical concerns by analyzing a cross-sectional sample of third-party recognitions for design excellence received by B2B firms. The positive results from the event study method of analysis and the model-free evidence regarding an immediate and significant sales effect eliminate doubts about the significance of this type of recognition in B2B markets, highlighting the importance of third-party recognition for design excellence for B2B researchers and managers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second theoretical contribution of the research is the broader conceptual perspective it provides regarding thirdparty recognition for design excellence. To this point, researchers have heavily emphasized the impact of third-party recognition using signaling theory and focusing on changes in customer demand as a result of changes in consumers’ perceptions of a firm’s product quality (e.g., Balasubramanian, Mathur, and Thakur 2005; Chen, Liu, and Zhang 2012; Chen and Xie 2005). The current research offers an alternative but complementary view by focusing on the topic from a demand shock perspective. This new perspective recognizes the demand-side impact suggested by signaling theory while highlighting a supply-side perspective that emphasizes a firm’s bracing activity in the context of demand uncertainty as it attempts to leverage the demand shock. This latter managerial viewpoint is missing from a signaling theory perspective, but the empirical findings involving CEO functional experience support its importance and the contribution of a demand shock conceptualization.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, the results related to CEO functional experience cannot be explained purely by signaling theory. Prior research has suggested that investors should expect superior designs from CEOs with market experience because of the important contribution of this type of knowledge in creating superior product designs (Im et al. 2016). Thus, CEO market experience should be a weak quality signal. Alternatively, investors should have lower expectations of superior designs based on CEO finance experience because of the internal focus of this type of experience. This should make CEO finance experience a stronger signal to investors relative to CEO marketing experience. However, follow-up analysis of the standardized coefficients reveals that the effect of CEO market experience (beta coefficient = .62) and the effect of CEO finance experience (beta coefficient = .65) are very close in magnitude. The closeness of the effects aligns with the demand shock arguments we proffer here, such that both types of experience provide important information related to B2B switching costs and their role in determining the effect of third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third contribution of the research involves its addition of hitherto unexplored boundary conditions to the literature. Prior research by Balasubramanian, Mathur, and Thakur (2005) has found that the effect of recognition for design excellence can vary by the source of recognition. Guo (2010) showed how the impact can vary on the basis of differences in the history of design’s competitive importance across industries. In our research, we included several controls to account for these findings. The significance found for CEO role experience related to markets and finance demonstrates the importance of adding CEO functional experience to the set of factors known to create boundary conditions moderating the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While these findings broaden researchers’ theoretical understanding of third-party recognition and design excellence in B2B markets, they also raise several important questions in need of research. For instance, do investors vary the importance they assign to CEO functional experience in managing a demand shock depending on the source (e.g., economic events, natural disasters), valence (positive or negative), and level (macro or micro) of a demand shock? Moreover, what other factors create demand shocks in B2B markets besides third-party recognition for design excellence? Research in B2C markets has suggested that firm promotional activity can create a demand shock (e.g., Pauwels et al. 2004). Does firm-level promotional activity have a similar effect in B2B markets? If so, how does the effect vary across different forms of promotion in B2B markets? Addressing these questions will be important for marketing researchers to fully understand the role of demand shocks and the factors that influence a firm’s ability to manage them effectively.</p><a id="AN0128990187-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-21" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research suggests several factors managers should consider to ensure that their firms benefit from innovation strategies based on superior designs. First, the findings recommend that B2B marketers invest in receiving thirdparty recognition for design excellence. The doubts induced by prior research regarding the effect of this kind of recognition in B2B markets created a difficult situation for B2B marketers. It forced them to choose between making significant investments to achieve recognition (Larsen and Lewis 2007)—without any confidence that the investments would pay off—and forgoing the investments and assuming the risk of being classified into a low-quality group because of a lack of recognition (Rossman and Schilke 2016). This research provides strong evidence in support of the former decision, and B2B marketers can use this empirical evidence to acquire the resources necessary to achieve third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another implication of the research is that it calls for marketing managers to alter their view regarding third-party recognition for design excellence. A recent survey of practitioners reveals that managers see little direct economic value in third-party recognition for design excellence (Sung, Nam, and Chung 2010). This research clearly shows that this form of recognition warrants more serious attention from managers because of the positive impact it can have on firm value and sales, as shown in the event study and model-free analysis, respectively. Importantly, the research also reveals that B2B marketers can expect to best leverage the recognition when their CEO possesses the right types of functional experience. We found that marketing and finance experience were especially helpful in managing and benefiting from the demand shock accompanying third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, promotion intensity has a significant and positive effect on the difference in ARs. When viewed in light of the overall positive effect we found for third-party recognition of design excellence, this finding suggests that firms can amplify the positive effect of achieving third-party recognition for design excellence through their marketing efforts. Importantly, we measured promotional activity based on expenditures toward SG&amp;A relative to revenue drawing on prior research suggesting that the sales force is the primary promotional activity within B2B firms (Biemans, Brencic, and Malshe 2010) and that sales force activity is typically associated with short-term promotional activity that aligns closely with the short-term nature of a demand shock (Homburg and Jensen 2007). The positive effect found for promotion intensity suggests that investment in the sales force can be one way in which a B2B firm can enhance the returns from third-party recognition for design excellence.</p><a id="AN0128990187-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990187-22" title="Limitations">Limitations</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There are several limitations to note when considering the research findings. Because of data limitations, our measurement of CEO functional experience did not measure actual years of experience. Instead, CEO functional experience was measured on the basis of the relative intensity of the CEO’s experience in different functional areas. This measurement approach should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another point to consider is that the removal of announcements with confounding events in the research helped ensure internal validity of the empirical findings. However, the trade-off is that it may weaken external validity if the recognition is considerably more significant when conflated with other events (Warren and Sorescu 2017). Thus, one should interpret the results reported in this research as a conservative estimate of the impact of third-party recognition for design excellence on firm value in B2B markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, the research did not identify the path through which CEO functional experience has its influence within a recognized firm. The CEO effect could be the result of the CEO’s individual decision making or it could be the result of the CEO’s effectiveness in coaching the firm’s staff (or some combination thereof). Future research is needed to provide insight on this issue.</p><a id="AN0128990187-23"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0128990187-23" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  In testing H2 and H3, the baseline is other CEO functional experiences because each type of CEO functional experience is measured as a percentage of a CEO’s total experience across functional areas.

In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products' tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product's past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products' biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: storytelling; narrative thinking; repurposed products; upcycling; recycling; felt specialness; product history</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A worn-out airbag becomes a backpack. A leaky boat turns into a table. An old mosquito net transforms into a laptop sleeve. Product biographies that entail transformations from an old past identity to a new product identity are characteristic of production modes that involve the repurposing of old or dysfunctional products into new products. These include recycling, which is already common practice ([86]), and upcycling, which is gaining in popularity ([63]; [85]). For instance, a search on Instagram for upcycling yields over 1 million results, and the upcycled offers on the online marketplace Etsy have increased by 1,000% since 2011, with Etsy now featuring more than 300,000 different upcycled products in the United States alone. Many established companies, such as the outdoor brand Patagonia or the fashion retailers ASOS and Urban Outfitters, have also started to operate in this domain.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, when companies offer new products manufactured from old or waste products, how can they ensure that customers will demand these products? In this article, we show how the unique properties of repurposed and transformed products illustrate a novel way of storytelling in marketing. Unlike conventionally produced goods, such products have both a clear past and present product identity. Although they may vastly diverge in their form and purpose, both identities are embodied in the product. We argue that the past identity of a repurposed product amounts to the starting point of its biographical story of transformation, and that this holds storytelling potential. We refer to this strategy of alerting customers to a product's past identity as "past identity salience" and argue that it increases demand because it triggers narrative product thoughts and allows customers to feel special with the storied product. Notably, the past identity involves a waste product (e.g., a broken mosquito net) that may not serve the product's current primary function (e.g., a wallet made from a broken mosquito net). Even though a product's past identity is effectively useless (and potentially even disgusting), we suggest that marketers highlight it because it unlocks the product's storytelling potential.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results of three field experiments, four experiments conducted in controlled settings, and several replication studies support these claims. Our evidence pertains to different proxies of demand, stretches across multiple product categories and past identities, holds at both the store and product level, and emerges across different methods of making the past identity salient. We rule out several alternative accounts (perceived environmental friendliness, interestingness, surprise, originality, authenticity, a handmade effect, and informational value) and deduce two relevant boundary conditions. When a mere glance at the product allows customers to discern its past, simple appeals to the past identity do not further increase demand. Moreover, making the past identity salient only increases demand if the product had a prior life—and thus, a starting point of its biographical story. This applies to upcycling and the closely related practice of recycling ([55]; [86]) but not to conventionally produced products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The present research offers important contributions to the storytelling literature in marketing. First, we show that marketers can utilize products' own biographical stories rather than craft stories around product use or brand values, which dominate existing practices ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref6" title="3">3</a>]; [27]; [71]; [79]). Second, and in line with the story-prone nature of the human mind ([10]; [15]), we show that storytelling does not require explicit detail. Simple cues suffice for customers to note the presence of a story and essentially tell it to themselves ([40]). Notably, we show that this boosts demand even if the starting point of these stories is prosaic, such as a past identity as a mundane pallet or an old mosquito net. Third, and drawing on the finding that storied objects are deemed special ([34]), we identify a rarely examined key mechanism that underlies our effects on demand: storied products provide customers with felt specialness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also contribute to the growing literature on products that entail the use of materials with a prior life and identity ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref14" title="1">1</a>]). As one of the first empirical studies of upcycling from a marketer's perspective, we highlight that success is more likely if marketers focus on the special biographies of upcycled products as their unique selling proposition ([46]). This is an important contribution, because it also extends to recycling and provides marketers of upcycled and recycled goods with actionable techniques to increase customer demand—an effort that is needed to realize the environmental and economic potential of these market practices ([48]).</p><a id="AN0138992844-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-2" title="Conceptual Background">Conceptual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0138992844-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-3" title="Repurposed Products and the Salience of Past Identities">Repurposed Products and the Salience of Past Identities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Upcycling is a sustainable production mode that prolongs the life of old objects by creatively reusing and reshaping them into new products ([13]; [85]). This repurposing practice allows brands to tap into new markets and generate value from what otherwise might be waste ([12]; [30]; [88]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Upcycling shares this benefit with other sustainable practices of product reuse, such as secondhand products ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref22" title="2">2</a>]; [45]; [46]), vintage products ([20]; [82]), or social recycling ([22]). However, these practices amount to the simple reuse of the same product by a different owner. In contrast, upcycling entails repurposing old products and results in a new product. It is thus similar to recycling, wherein the value is in old materials being transformed by breaking them down into raw materials before turning them into new products again ([12]; [77]; [84]). Both upcycling and recycling involve the repurposing of old products and entail a true and substantive transformation, in which the nature of the outcome product differs from the nature of its discarded source product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a result of this transformation, repurposed products have two differing identities: a past identity, which is derived from the form and functionality of the source product, and a present identity, which captures the product's current and mostly different form and functionality. While marketers can focus on the upcycled product's benefits and emphasize elements of its present identity, they can also highlight the product's now dysfunctional past and draw customers' attention to the old or waste materials that compose the product. We call this strategy of alerting customers to the repurposed product's past identity "past identity salience." For example, an ad for a wallet made out of old mosquito nets could either not mention this past or explicitly state that it is made from mosquito nets, which is what some upcycling brands do. For example, the luxury bag brand Elvis &amp; Kresse (<a href="http://www.elvisandkresse.com/">www.elvisandkresse.com</a>) prominently references to the past identities of its products in its communications, and the Swiss brand Freitag leverages the fact that its bags and accessories are made from truck tarps (<a href="http://www.freitag.ch/">www.freitag.ch</a>). The Berlin-based store Upcycling Deluxe even enables its customers to search for products on the basis of what they used to be (<a href="http://www.upcycling-deluxe.com/">www.upcycling-deluxe.com</a>). Recycling brands, in contrast, frequently draw attention to the recycled nature of their products but do not disclose their specific past identities. It is still unclear whether the demand for repurposed products benefits or suffers from a strategy of "past identity salience."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several findings actually discourage highlighting repurposed products' past identities. Many customers are skeptical about purchasing used goods ([41]), and they can be sensitive to the physical distortion of a product, which makes them dispose of it more quickly ([77]). Indeed, upcycled products often show traces of wear and tear from their original purpose, which makes customers aware that they are not the first person to interact with the product. Drawing attention to the product's past identity may thus elicit processes of contagion that prevent customers from opting for a product contaminated by other people ([<a id="bib5up

Through this transformation, a salient past identity not only fails to harm demand but, on the contrary, fuels demand, and we propose that this is because past identity salience draws attention to the product's special story. Repurposed products can serve as a prime example of how past identity salience can trigger the persuasive story of a product's biographical transformation.</p><a id="AN0138992844-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-4" title="Past Identity Salience as a Story Cue">Past Identity Salience as a Story Cue</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This argument is new to the storytelling literature in marketing. To support it, we first need to address the question "What is a story?" Essentially, a story is a linear temporal sequence of causally related events ([27], [28]). It is a chronological description of which events occurred and how they are connected. Another term consumer researchers have used to describe this is "narrative" ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref39" title="3">3</a>]; [27], [28]). Note, however, that other literature has distinguished between these terms in that "story" refers to a chronological chain of events and "narrative" to their causal factors ([68]; [73]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Chronology and causality are the central structural characteristics that enable narrative thinking ([19]; [27], [28]; [73]). Chronology refers to the temporal sequence or episodes of events ([65]) and to the fact that stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end ([28]; [74]). Causality is defined as the causal connections or relationships between story elements ([27]) that enable customers to assign meaning to a narrative. Rather than causality, some authors use the term "plot," which refers to the theme of a story and imbues story events with meaning ([65]). Stories can feature any number of specific story elements, which are woven together in a plot. Several typologies have been offered to explain the plots of stories throughout history (e.g., [<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref53" title="9">9</a>]; [16]; [76]). Although plots differ, a prototypical narrative features a protagonist who is the main character of the story ([65]), such as Cinderella, who participates in story events ([19]). Notably, the mere presence of a main character can serve as a means to provide causality ([19]; [79]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Humans have been attuned to stories and narrative thinking since the dawn of humankind and stories wield considerable power over people ([15]). They are able to demonstrate, communicate, and persuade ([27], [26]). The marketing literature has been well aware of stories' ability to fuel demand ([79]; [83]; [87]), and storytelling is a common marketing practice ([71]; [80]). Marketers tell brand stories ([71]) and stories in which products affect consumers ([49]; [83]), and artists tell stories that feature products or brands as contextual elements or accessories, as in the case of product placement ([44]; [70]). In most of these stories, the product is not the main protagonist, and all of them are clearly recognizable as fully fledged stories that someone tells.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Advancing current theorizing, we suggest adding the product's own biographical story to marketers' storytelling toolbox. Moreover, we suggest that marketers can trigger these stories without spelling them out. Simply making the product's past identity salient, as we propose, can induce customers to infer a repurposed product's biographical story and in turn increase demand for the storied product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">But how can customers comprehend such stories when an ad features no more than the product and a reference to its past identity? The answer lies in the fact that humans are uniquely attuned to engage in narrative thinking and discern, self-tell, and appreciate a good story ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref73" title="3">3</a>]; [27]). Moreover, even simple past identity appeals map onto the key structural story characteristics of chronology and causality. As to chronology, a product's past identity is an episode in its life that chronologically precedes its present identity. Making the past identity salient thus ensures that multiple chronologically ordered episodes in the product's life become salient. As to causality, salience of the product's past and present identities implies their causal connection. The repurposed product is the protagonist that ensures causality through its implied identity transformation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Transformational stories are historically one of the most popular forms of story ([16]; [67]). They involve a change in identity as part of the protagonist's biography. Also known as metamorphosis ([76]), this type of plot involves a temporally bounded event (i.e., the transformation) wherein the protagonist changes from one permanent state to a new permanent state without the disappearance of the protagonist from the story ([40]). Metamorphosis plots are present throughout history ([33]), ranging from stories from antiquity (e.g., Ovid's <em>Metamorphoses</em>), to more recent novels (e.g., Franz Kafka's <em>The Metamorphosis</em>), fairy tales (e.g., Cinderella), and popular culture (e.g., <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>). Notably, it also extends to the biographical stories of repurposed goods, which transform from being a depreciated product on the verge of the waste-bin to a storied new object with multiple identities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Transformational stories are particularly powerful in terms of inducing narrative thoughts. They only need what narratologists term a "minimal narrative" to unfold in people's minds. A minimal narrative consists of identical entities that are present in two temporally and qualitatively distinct states ([66]). The essence of minimal narratives is time change and, often, transformation ([54]). In our research, the minimal narrative consists of the protagonist in time 1 (the salience of the product's past identity) and the transformed protagonist in time 2 (the upcycled or recycled present product identity). Minimal narratives are more than a mere ordered sequence of events because of their overall meaning ([54]), which unfolds in perceivers' minds.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We propose that customers will infer a repurposed product's story when its past is salient because this salience allows for an awareness of the plot (i.e., how the different identities are connected via the transformation). To attain that meaning, customers need to engage in inferential processing. Inferencing forms the narrative linkages that empower minimal narratives (past identity, present identity). To engage in inferential processing, individuals need to draw on their personal knowledge and imagination. In a dynamic process, individuals interact with the presented story elements, infer missing information, and include past information to disambiguate stories ([32]; [42]). Research in psychology and consumer research shows that humans are genuinely prone to take agency and engage in inferencing and using their imagination to generate story causality ([27]; [35]; [79]) and to thus complete or comprehend a story that is not fully spelled out.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A plot of transformation provides a particularly rich resource for inferential narrative processing. The multiple identities and the metamorphosis itself allow for multifaceted interpretations ([32]; [42]) and provide perceivers with a wide projection; inferencing; and, thus, storytelling space. We therefore expect that a salient cue for a repurposed product's past identity will suffice to induce perceivers to infer its biographical story of transformation.</p><a id="AN0138992844-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-5" title="Specialness as a Mechanism">Specialness as a Mechanism</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Why would people demand a product that holds a story of having been waste more than a product that does not? We propose that storied products cause higher demand because they imbue customers with felt specialness—that is, the belief that they will feel more special as a result of acquiring and utilizing a product that holds a story.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To understand how stories can evoke a sense of specialness in people, it is important to understand the ways in which stories affect people ([15]; [27]; [49]). On the one hand, stories focus them on the narrative rather than on rational arguments ([49]), potentially even transporting (i.e., absorbing) recipients into a story ([36]; [79]). However, for this to happen, people must experience the pathos of a dramatic story ([64]) and feel empathy for story characters ([79]). This tends to necessitate the act of telling a fully-fledged story to passive recipients. The minimal narrative provided by quick exposure to an ad including past identity cues is unlikely to allow for either of these experiences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On the other hand, and largely fueled by inferential processes, stories help people in their sensemaking process ([87]). This mechanism is well-suited to explain the appeal triggered by minimal narratives. People's narrative thoughts help shape their perceptions of the story's protagonist and its meanings ([27]). When stories are self-inferred, they are personal to the individual ([74]; [83]) and can evoke diverse special and individual meanings ([57]; [69]). For example, if a customer sees an ad for a wallet made from an old mosquito net, they might draw on their own associations and think of the lives the net has saved or connect it with their own personal travels. These self-inferred, special meanings help decommodify the object ([25]; [46]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Simply "having" a story suffices for the protagonist to become more special. Cinderella, for example, is a special princess thanks to her story of transformation (see [31] for how biographical transformations affect the appreciation of the "transformer"). Like Cinderella, repurposed products are the protagonist in a transformational story that imbues them with a unique biographical history, and objects with such a story are likely to be perceived as special ([46]), even by young children ([62]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, the meanings of objects tend to transfer to those who acquire and utilize them ([52]) and can help individuals in their identity work, a process that often motivates the decision of whether to acquire an object ([<a id="bib4up

This invites customers to engage in narrative thinking and allows them to infer an individualized and special version of the product's story. Perceiving the product as storied, in turn, enables customers to feel special with the product, which eventually triggers demand. Figure 1 provides an overview of the propositions made.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1.

Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 provide evidence for the effect of past identity salience on real-world product demand. Studies 1a and 1b investigate this in actual Facebook campaigns. Study 2 examines sales data for an experimental upcycling pop-up store. Studies 3, 4, and 6 demonstrate that past identity salience increases demand because the product's biographical story affords people with specialness and generalizes our findings to different types of products and past identities as well as the various claims that make these identities salient.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also provide evidence of the limits of past identity salience. Marketer-crafted allusions to a product's past identity are not the only means through which individuals may infer a product's biographical story. Products with an easily discernible past identity, such as a bag sewn out of highly visible candy wrappers, already provide all the cues needed for the story to unfold in a customer's mind. We thus do not expect additional appeals to a product's past identity to increase demand when the past identity is already salient. Study 5 demonstrates that visual discernibility of a product's past identity acts as a moderator.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given that any biographical transformation requires a past identity, we also do not expect results to generalize to genuinely new products. Study 6 thus compares different production modes and shows that our effect is specific to repurposed products. In particular, it extends our findings to the more prevalent market practice of recycling and demonstrates that they do not generalize to conventional modes of production.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we address several alternative explanations across studies.

The respective codes are past identity, in which the prior life of the product was prominent; metamorphosis, in which the product's transformation was prominent; and other biographical elements, in which chronology and causality of the product's story were present but neither could be clearly identified as central.

If felt specialness drives the effect, then this route should be less pronounced for those who feel very special already. In addition, Study 4 ensures robustness of the results by extending the inquiry to minimal appeals (i.e., simple "made from" claims that neither spell out the story directly nor depict the past identity) and to a new product category and different source product (i.e., a wooden table made from a pallet).

These insights advance our current understanding of customer reactions to goods made from repurposed materials and open the window to a new facet of powerful storytelling in marketing.</p><a id="AN0138992844-61"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-61" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we provide novel contributions to the extant literature on storytelling and to the burgeoning literature on upcycling and recycling as two production modes that involve the use of repurposed materials. With regard to the storytelling literature, we show that one salient piece of information, the product's past identity (i.e., the beginning of its biographical story) suffices to trigger the perception of the product as having a story. We observe this regardless of how we worded this information, from the somewhat story-like "in my previous life I used to be..." (Study 5) to the less story-like "I was made from..." (Study 4), to the purely informative "upcycled from..." (Supplementary Study 2, Web Appendix W3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In contrast to prevalent storytelling practices, which focus on stories about product use or storied metaphors of a brand's essence ([21]; [27]), we focused on the story entailed in a product's own biography. We thus extend this literature by highlighting how products can be protagonists in their own life stories. This raises the question of what such product life stories need to look like to persuade. Our evidence suggests that a product's metamorphosis, its transformation from a past identity, plays a crucial role. Metamorphosis or transformations are powerful narratives ([18]; [40]), and it seems that the source or consequence of the transformation is secondary to there <em>being</em> a transformation. Whatever past identity we used (from airbags to insulators) and whatever the transformation (from bags to tables), the results generalized. Just knowing that there <em>has been</em> a different past identity appears to suffice. We argue that it is this knowledge that invites the inference of all elements necessary for narrative thinking ([27]), a sequence of episodes (chronology) that logically build onto each other (causality).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Contrary to most current literature, we never actually spelled out the product's story. Instead, we had customers infer the story by using a "minimal narrative" of making two different identities of the same product salient ([66]). Our minimal intervention of past identity salience highlights that the mere presence of a story can be persuasive. This adds a novel facet to storytelling in marketing and advances prior literature that suggests that stories work particularly well, if people experience narrative transportation ([26]; [79])—that is, become absorbed in narrated stories (see [21]] and [49]], who also find that stories can persuade without transportation).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Why are these minimal stories persuasive? Because customers feel more special with a product that holds a biography (i.e., a story). We consistently found this, even when we controlled for novelty, surprise, authenticity, and originality. A good story increases appreciation for the story character ([<a id="bib3up

Because people want to feel special, the promise of specialness fuels demand ([38] ; [81]). This observation fits with prior insights on the specialness-affording value of object history ([20]; [46]; [82]), but it constitutes a novel insight in the domain of storytelling. Having a story to tell should thus be added among the factors known to make customers feel special (e.g., [<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref191" title="8">8</a>]; [38]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The power of the mere presence of a product's biographical story also allows our insights to be positioned with regard to different production modes. On the one side, our results help distinguish upcycling (our key phenomenon) from consumption of secondhand goods and vintage items, in which a product's prior life matters greatly and contagion is an issue ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref193" title="2">2</a>]; [37]; [45]). In contrast, upcycling encompasses the presence of a radical transformation away from a product's past identity. This transformation eliminates any taint associated with an upcycled product's past, although this past still makes it special. Notably, our findings generalize to recycling, in which products with past identities are broken down prior to being transformed into new products ([55]). A process of transformation thus appears to be a managerially relevant conceptual distinction within market practices that draw on used materials. This insight also aligns well with [86], who find that highlighting a product's transformative potential increases rates of recycling waste materials. Notably, our focus on metamorphosis or transformation also distinguishes upcycling and recycling from conventional production modes that create products from raw materials that are mostly devoid of a prior life and identity (Study 6). Our results suggest that insights from recycling may generalize to upcycling and vice versa. For both practices, marketers would do well to utilize transformational product biographies as their unique selling proposition. This sets a first benchmark for marketers in upcycling and provides a new lens for thinking about recycling. To date, most recycled products stress the environmental benefits rather than the specialness affordance inherent to past identities. More broadly, our results answer calls for marketing research on products created in environmentally friendly ways ([48]) and add to findings that suggest that environmentally friendly options are not necessarily preferred or avoided for their environmental impact ([14]; [50]). We show that these products may be preferred if they afford specialness.</p><a id="AN0138992844-62"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-62" title="Future Research Directions">Future Research Directions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Highlighting a novel facet of storytelling within an upcoming mode of production provides substantial scope for future research. On the one hand, there are several open questions with regard to storytelling. One question is whether there are story elements that might be particularly powerful. In Study 3, we found that past identity salience triggered different narrative thoughts. Future research could explore how and whether such differences affect felt specialness and demand. Another open question is whether results would differ if marketers were to narrate the product's biography in full. Would the effect be enhanced because everyone picks up on the story, or would it be reduced because there is less scope for self-inferencing? A related question asks how powerful a product's biographical story would be compared with other stories told in marketing. This is a relevant but tricky question because stories are more than the sum of their elements. We nonetheless explored this in a supplementary study (Supplementary Study 2, Web Appendix W3). An ad for a laptop sleeve either implied its story through its stated past identity (upcycled from an old mosquito net) or narrated a story of its inception (the product creators were inspired by watching a spider web). The respective stories affected demand to the extent to which participants perceived the product to hold a story. Notably, the marketer-narrated story about the design inspiration imbued the product with less of a story and led to a smaller increase in appeal than the self-inferred story triggered by past identity salience. Future research is needed to identify whether the embodiment of a story in the product outperforms narrated stories that are meant to "rub off" onto the product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future research is also needed to ensure that the results are unaffected by the specific sampling frames we used. We tested our predictions across a range of samples from Austria, including Facebook users (Studies 1a–b), passers-by on campus (Study 2), convenience samples (Study 5), and pure student samples (Study 6). In addition, we conducted some studies with U.S.-based MTurk workers (Studies 3 and 4). Future research is needed to ensure that our conclusions extend beyond these populations. In particular, non-Western cultures may be more reluctant to adopt used goods ([89]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Running our own pop-up store, we learned firsthand how different reactions to upcycling can be. Some people appear to be entirely averse to the notion of old source products. Past identity salience may intensify these individuals' aversions, but these individuals might never fall into the target group. This does, however, raise the question of whether brands should highlight the fact that their branded products become repurposed, and whether they should use the same or a different brand for repurposed products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The effects we observed appeared rather robust regarding who makes the product (see follow-up analyses on perceptions as handmade for Study 4, Web Appendix W2) and what the product was made of. We surmise that the metamorphosis removes the potential taint of nearly any past identity, and we find in a supplementary study (Supplementary Study 3, Web Appendix W3) that even the salience of a truly disgusting past identity (dirty mosquito net) did not hurt demand. The appeal of the past identity may nonetheless influence the size of the effect. This speaks to the power of transformations in overcoming issues of contagion and opens up several lines of future inquiry. For example, does the extent to which the past identity becomes transfigured and distorted in the process of upcycling matter ([77])? Do functional source products (e.g., a glass window) result in different responses to hedonic source products (e.g., a decorative glass vase)? Moreover, who reacts most to past identity appeals, and are there people for whom such appeals backfire? Given that we find that demand is driven by felt specialness, it is plausible that customers who are low in power ([23]) or who feel a need for status ([24]; [75]) would react more strongly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The observed power of a prior life may also advance research on other effects attributed to a product's origin or production mode. Storytelling principles might further increase the effectiveness of appeals related to prior users (e.g., [<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref206" title="6">6</a>]), brands, and production sites (e.g., [59]) as well as production and design modes (e.g., [29]). Whether results generalize to such diverse aspects of a product's origin is, however, an open question. Prior research has only tended to find positive effects of appeals to a product's origin when the highlighted origin aspect is desirable. This rests on the notion that the essence of what goes into a product persists in the final product. For example, [59] found that products made in a firm's original manufacturing location hold more appeal because they are believed to contain more of the brand's authentic essence. In contrast, we found that past identity appeals work even when they highlight a discarded origin. In this respect, our findings are particularly novel.</p><a id="AN0138992844-63"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-63" title="Practical Implications">Practical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The salience of a product's past identity robustly increased demand across a wide variety of contexts (store and product level, online and offline), categories (e.g., wallets, vases, chandeliers), ad appeals, and product origins (e.g., mosquito nets, parachutes, airbags). In a real store (Study 2), revenues more than quadrupled when we made the past identities of products the focal point of our marketing materials. Online (Study 1a), social media likes more than doubled, and in all instances where we expected to find an increase in WTP or choice share, such an increase was found. The upcycled (vs. conventional) alternative was chosen at least 12% more often when the past identity was made salient.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, our results generalized to recycling. When marketing products made from either of those production modes—recycling or upcycling—marketers should appeal to the product's past, even though this past has no bearing on the product's present identity or functionality. Regardless of what source product we used, past identity salience never reduced demand. However, when upcycled products told their story at a glance, simply restating the past identity did not further boost demand. This finding holds two important implications. First, in recycling, products are broken down to their granular structure. The past identities of recycled products are thus never visually discernible, suggesting that the more prevalent practice of recycling may benefit from past identity salience even more consistently than upcycling. This is an important contribution. In line with our market observations, most companies that use recycled materials simply stress their environmental friendliness but do little to highlight the specific source material going into their products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, the boundary condition of past identity discernibility (Study 5) may be overcome even for upcycled products. In two additional studies (Supplementary Studies 4a and 4b in Web Appendix W3), we devised ways in which marketers can do so. We found that easily executed visual tweaks that logically reinforce the product's biographical story boosted product demand even when the product's past identity was discernible at first glance. The key appears to lie in storytelling principles. These suggest reinforcing the chronological and causal structure inherent to the product's story ([51]; i.e., feature the past identity first and more prominently than the resulting product).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our implications also extend to the general adoption of the practice of upcycling. Every year, two billion tons of waste go to landfills around the world, posing a continuous threat to the environment, the economy, and society ([77]; [84]). Encouraging upcycling means that product waste will be reduced, resulting in less landfill and incineration, more energy savings, and decreases in industrial emissions ([11]). Upcycling has experienced impressive growth rates ([72]) and allows for a value-adding possibility in companies' own waste management, but it is still a niche phenomenon. Entering this market may be a worthwhile opportunity. Whenever we asked participants to choose between an upcycled product and conventional product, a substantial proportion of people preferred the upcycled option, and our pop-up store sparked interest. The addition of upcycled products to a retailer's portfolio may be an actionable way to attract customers who want to feel special but lack the financial resources for status symbols.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Like Cinderella, the life of upcycled products holds the ingredients for the plot of a bestselling story. This article shows that we can learn from this story and that there may be more to storytelling than currently practiced in marketing. Stories truly unfold in customers' minds ([27]; [79]), but to date marketers appear to think that they have to do all the telling. Our results suggest that customers infer stories, even when they only see a single piece of information. Our results also suggest that stories may imbue potential weaknesses in a product's image (such as a useless past identity) with meaning that benefits rather than hurts demand. Customers appear to feel special when they obtain a product that allows them to infer its story. Perhaps it is time to think of marketing as the creation of a projection space for stories that customers tell and help marketers sell.</p><a id="AN0138992844-64"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138992844-64" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919872156 - A Cinderella Story: How Past Identity Salience Boosts Demand for Repurposed Products</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919872156 for A Cinderella Story: How Past Identity Salience Boosts Demand for Repurposed Products by Bernadette Kamleitner, Carina Thürridl and Brett A.S.

Kumar’s (2018) insightful editorial focuses on transformative marketing and its implications for research in marketing, marketing practice, marketing education, and marketing and public policy. While Kumar covers a vast terrain, in this commentary, I specifically focus on the transformative marketing landscape framework and related discussion in the editorial. In the framework, Kumar delineates a number of environmental changes that challenge the status quo of organizations, transformative marketing as the organizational response, and greater marketing effectiveness and efficiency as among the outcomes. Kumar notes that transformative marketing operates in an environment that is rooted in data (i.e., use of a firm’s data resources to formulate and implement marketing strategy) and innovation. He notes that unlocking the potential of a firm’s data resources, in itself, constitutes an innovation. Kumar further notes that firms operating in a data-rich environment (a consequence of the rapid growth of digital data and digitization of data) actively engage in new ways of exploring data to gain insights.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a complement to the transformative marketing framework presented in Kumar (2018), in this commentary, I propose a conceptual framework delineating the relationships between a firm’s customer information assets, information analysis capabilities, customer knowledge, marketing strategy, and performance in a transformative landscape. Common to both frameworks are the outcomes of marketing strategy effectiveness and efficiency. Data resources, unlocking their potential, and generating insights from them in Kumar’s framework overlap with customer information assets, information analysis capabilities, and customer knowledge, respectively, in the proposed framework. The principal focus of the proposed framework is the digital data-rich environment as a transformative force in marketing. Although Kumar does not explicitly delineate this aspect in his framework, it reverberates in much of his discussion relating to it.</p><a id="AN0130025369-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0130025369-2" title="Market-Based Resources, Marketing Strategy, and Performance in a Transformative Landscape">Market-Based Resources, Marketing Strategy, and Performance in a Transformative Landscape</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey (1998) conceptualize marketbased assets as resources that arise from a firm’s commingling with entities in the external environment. They broadly distinguish between relational assets (resources that arise from a firm’s relationship with key external stakeholders) and intellectual assets (knowledge gained by the firm about the environment and specific entities in the environment). The authors highlight brand equity, customer equity, and channel equity as illustrative of a firm’s relational market-based resources, and knowledge about market conditions, customers, competitors, channel members, and suppliers as illustrative of intellectual market-based resources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In a digital data-rich environment, three market-based resources of major importance are a firm’s customer information assets, customer information analysis capabilities, and customer knowledge. Figure 1 presents a conceptual framework delineating the relationships between these resources, marketing strategy, and performance. As the figure shows, by effectively leveraging its customer information assets and information analysis capabilities, a firm can achieve an advantageous resource position in customer knowledge. Analogously, by effectively leveraging its advantageous resource position in customer knowledge to inform its marketing strategy decisions, a firm can achieve a better marketing strategy–market environment fit relative to its competitors and, thereby, greater marketing strategy effectiveness and efficiency as well as superior marketing and financial performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer information assets is defined as information of economic value about customers owned by a firm. In the DataInformation-Knowledge-Wisdom Pyramid framework (BurtonJones 1999, p. 6), information is conceptualized as “processed data that is meaningful and of value,” and knowledge as “understanding of information and its associated pattern.” Customer information analysis capabilities is defined as a firm’s complex bundles of skills and knowledge embedded in its organizational processes that it uses to generate customer knowledge from its customer information assets. The proposed definition builds on Day’s (1994) conceptualization of capability as complex bundles of skills and knowledge embedded in a firm’s organizational processes by which it transforms available resources into valuable outputs. It conceptually overlaps with Rubera, Chandrasekaran, and Ordanini’s (2016, p. 170) conceptualization of market information management capabilities as skills used by a firm to develop and use market knowledge (i.e., customer knowledge and competitor knowledge).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer knowledge is defined as a firm’s understanding of customers that informs its business decisions. Customer knowledge, broadly construed, encompasses a firm’s insights into or understanding of customers’ attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, demographics, desires, emotions, habits, interests, involvement, lifestyles, motives, needs, perceptions, preferences, psychographics, tastes, values, wants, and more—hence the proposed inclusive conceptual definition. However, the broad scope of customer knowledge necessitates the scope of the operational definition to be limited to a specific facet (e.g., wants) or a small number of facets (e.g., affects, cognitions, behaviors) of customer knowledge in specific research studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Marketing strategy is defined as a business’ crucial decisions concerning its planned pattern of behavior in the marketplace to achieve (facilitate the achievement of) a competitive advantage, and thereby realize specific organizational objectives. Marketing strategy addresses the fundamental question of how to compete in the marketplace (How to create, communicate, and deliver products that offer value to customers in mutually beneficial exchanges with the organization? How to engender specific affects, cognitions and behaviors in target customers?) Crucial and internally consistent decisions that are germane to marketing strategy include marketing activities to perform, their manner of performance in chosen markets and market segments, and the allocation of marketing resources among markets, market segments, and marketing activities (see Varadarajan 2010). In the proposed framework, the focus is not the full spectrum of marketing strategy, but rather those elements of marketing strategy that can be optimized in a digital data-rich environment (e.g., personalization of product offering and/or specific elements of the marketing mix).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fit refers to the degree to which a firm’s marketing strategy is appropriate for a particular market environment. In the context of a digital data-rich environment, in the limit, fit is the degree to which specific elements of a firm’s targeted marketing efforts are appropriate for individual customers (e.g., personalization of the product offering and promotional message content). Marketing strategy effectiveness is the extent to which the implementation of the strategy enables an organization to achieve its stated objectives. Marketing strategy efficiency is the ratio of the amount of marketing output generated to the amount of marketing resource inputs employed to implement the strategy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the internet-enabled, interactive and digital data-rich environment, the effect of customer knowledge advantage on marketing performance (i.e., effect of increase in market share in a growth market on the size of a firm’s customer base) will have a positive feedback effect on customer information assets accumulation. This is shown in the framework by the link from marketing performance to customer information assets. The dotted arrows in Figure 1 denote a firm’s assessment of gaps in its customer knowledge that limit its ability to compete more effectively and efficiently in the marketplace, and the underlying gaps in customer information assets and customer information analysis capabilities. Along the lines of heterogeneity among competitors in their customer information assets, customer information analysis capabilities and customer knowledge, there will also be heterogeneity among them with respect to customer knowledge gaps they aware of (known unknowns), and gaps they are unaware of (unknown unknowns).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The relationships delineated in the framework (Figure 1) are informed by insights from the resource-based view (RBV), capabilities-based view (CBV), and dynamic capabilities-based view (DCBV) of the firm. RBV posits that heterogeneous market positions result from effectively leveraging heterogeneous firm resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable and nonsubstitutable (VRIN resources) to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage in the marketplace (Barney 1991). CBV distinguishes between resources (stocks of available factors controlled by the firm), and capabilities (capacity of a firm to deploy resources, usually in combination, using organizational processes to achieve a desired end) (Amit and Schoemaker 1993). Rather than the mere possession of idiosyncratic assets and static capabilities, the DCBV considers a firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure competencies in response to a changing environment as crucial to achieving and sustaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (p. 516) define dynamic capabilities as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” The knowledge-based view (KBV) posits that knowledge is at the core of a firm’s competitiveness, and the way a firm creates, acquires, assimilates, and exploits knowledge leads to the creation of new sources of revenues and persistence of performance differences among competing firms (Grant 1996; Rubera, Chandrasekaran, and Ordanini 2016).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the proposed framework (Figure 1), customer knowledge, modeled as a firm resource, is distinct from knowledge embedded in a firm’s customer information analysis capabilities. The former refers to knowledge as understanding (knowing what something means) and the latter to knowledge as knowhow (knowing how to do something) (see Kogut and Zander 1992). Bierly, Kessler, and Christensen’s (2000) conceptualization of knowledge as the understanding of information and its associated pattern augurs with the former. Organizational knowledge embedded in a firm’s capabilities refers to the latter. Its tacit nature makes it relatively difficult for competitors to diagnose and/or replicate (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997) and transfer from one firm to another without also transferring ownership of the firm, or some self-contained subunit of the firm within which the capabilities reside (Makadok 2001).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although the proposed framework builds on literature insights from the RBV, CBV, and DCBV of the firm, it differs in certain respects. The proposed framework highlights organizational contexts in which certain types of resources (assets and capabilities) are leveraged to create another type of resource (knowledge), which is then leveraged to effectively compete in the marketplace. The following linkages underlying the RBV,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">CBV, and DCBV and the proposed framework (Figure 1) serve to highlight this distinction:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• RBV: Competing by leveraging superior resource positions in VRIN resources (A) → Competitive Advantage (B) → Performance (C).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• CBV and DCBV: Competing by leveraging superior firm</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">capabilities (A2) to effectively deploy superior firm resources (A1) → Competitive Advantage (B) → Performance (C).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Assets, capabilities, and knowledge framework (Figure 1):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Utilizing superior firm capabilities (A2) to effectively leverage superior firm assets (A1) to create superior knowledge resources (A3) → Competing by leveraging superior knowledge resources (A3) → Competitive Advantage (B) → Performance (C).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the broader context of interdependencies between three broad types of firm resources (information assets, information analysis capabilities, and knowledge), the proposed framework delineates the relationships between a firm’s customer information assets, customer information analysis capabilities, customer knowledge, marketing strategy and performance. The representative assets listed in Boxes A1 and A2 in Figure 1 highlight these relationships in the context of the digital data-rich environment characteristic of the transformative marketing landscape. The principal relationships delineated in Figure 1 can formally be stated as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer Knowledge Advantage Hypothesis</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Heterogeneity in customer information assets and customer information analysis capabilities, through their effects on customer knowledge, result in heterogeneity in the competitive market positions of firms. This effect will be more pronounced in digital data-rich competitive environments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The following real-world examples provide anecdotal support for the proposed framework and hypothesis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Doubling down on your distinctive strengths not only helps you fight disruption from upstarts, but it also enables you to disrupt an industry on your own terms. That’s exactly what Netflix did. In the late 1990s, the company competed directly with the Blockbuster retail chain. In 2007, when streaming video became viable, Netflix rapidly pivoted to offer that service. It … has pioneered the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to tailor its output to consumer interests. All along, its success has been enabled by a core distinctive strength: the ability to understand what its customers want and do, using in-depth analytics and the behavioral data it captures. (strategy+business 2017)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another blowout quarter from Alibaba highlights the Chinese e-commerce company’s ability to harness its trove of data to boost earnings… Its operating margin widened by 7 percentage points, which management attributed in part to better use of data, as operating profit almost doubled from a year ago…. It attributes the revenue increase to more shoppers as well as its ability to deliver more relevant content to them.… The company accounts for around three-quarters of online retail sales in China and hence has a trove of data on consumer behavior. Such data allow Alibaba to display ads to shoppers that they will most likely be interested in… Merchants are willing to pay higher prices if they know the ads are likely to draw in sales. Better algorithms allow Alibaba to earn more ad dollars without a similar rise in costs. (Wong 2017, p. B12)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By their very nature, models and frameworks such as that proposed here (Figure 1) are abstractions of reality. In this regard, an important societal issue in the current digital data-rich environment (and the focus of numerous journal articles, opinion pieces, and editorials) that merits mention is the divide between a firm profitably serving consumers by leveraging its advantageous resource positions in customer information assets, information analysis capabilities and customer knowledge, and invasion of consumers’ privacy.</p><a id="AN0130025369-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0130025369-3" title="Transformative Forces Affecting Marketing and Marketing as a Transformative Force">Transformative Forces Affecting Marketing and Marketing as a Transformative Force</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Certain environmental developments have a transformative effect on marketing, and certain marketing innovations have a transformative effect on the environment.

The effects of transformative innovations, broadly construed (e.g., breakthrough, disruptive, game changing, radical, revolutionary innovations), such as the following, provide a baseline frame of reference for gaining insights into the transformative effects of marketing innovations, both past (e.g., supermarket, discount, and department store chains; e-commerce, mobile e-commerce, and e-customer relationship management) and future:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in how a specific need or set of needs and</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">wants of consumers are met.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in how consumers search, evaluate, purchase, consume/use, and dispose of a product—fundamental changes in consumer behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in the value proposition offered to customers and/or expected by customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in how a product is produced, promoted, distributed, priced, and so on—fundamental changes in the marketing behavior of firms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Emergence of a new industry, or convergence of two or more existing industries.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in the structural characteristics of an industry such as market size, market growth rate, industry concentration, entry barriers and exit barriers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in the composition of competitors in an industry following entry of new firms, exit of incumbent firms, and changes in the competitive positions of incumbent firms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Major changes in the configuration of value chain activities, assets mix, cost elements, and/or revenue model in an industry.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• In the limit, the effects of an innovation (e.g., civilization transforming/epochal innovation) can be tectonic in nature, such as transformative cultural, economic, political and/or social changes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The history of successful transformative innovations, the technologies underlying them, and the role of marketing as a catalyst in their adoption and diffusion is suggestive of technology, innovation, and marketing as a transformative triad.

Of the various types of firm resources, the framework specifically focuses on three major types: assets (A1), capabilities (A2), and knowledge (A3). The dotted arrows denote a firm’s assessment of customer knowledge gaps that constrain its ability to more effectively and efficiently compete in the marketplace, the underlying customer information assets gaps, and customer information analysis capabilities gaps. Here again, there will be heterogeneity across firms in respect of known unknowns (customer-related knowledge gaps that the firm is aware of), and unknown unknowns (customer-related knowledge gaps that the firm is not even aware of).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">DIAGRAM: FIGURE 1 Conceptual Framework</p><a id="AN0130025369-4"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0130025369-4" title=" REFERENCES  "> REFERENCES  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Amit, Raphael, and Paul J.H.

The authors use a meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on advertising creativity and test different theoretical explanations for its effects. The analysis covers 93 data sets taken from 67 papers that provide 878 effect sizes. The results show robust positive effects but also highlight the importance of considering both originality and appropriateness when investing in advertising creativity. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are stronger for high- (vs. low-) involvement products, and that the effects on ad (but not brand) reactions are marginally stronger for unfamiliar brands. An empirical test of theoretical mechanisms shows that affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly explain these effects, and that originality mainly leads to affect transfer, whereas appropriateness leads to signaling. The authors also call for further research connecting advertising creativity with sales and studying its effects in digital contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: advertising; affect transfer; creativity; meta-analysis; processing; signaling</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Creativity is important in marketing and is often considered to be at the heart of the advertising industry. The importance of creativity is highlighted, for example, in the popularity of industry competitions, such as the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the growing academic literature on its effects (e.g., [68]; [85]). However, the value of creativity is also subject to longstanding debate ([<a id="bib5up

Marketers wanting to answer these questions will find little guidance in the academic literature. Although the link between advertising expenditure and advertising effects has been consistently supported ([38]; [80]), to date, there is no comprehensive account of advertising creativity and its influence on consumer response. Even [83] failed to account for creativity as a factor in their insightful and influential review of how advertising works.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several factors seem to hold back scholarship in advertising creativity: (<a id="bib1up

Given the apparent confusion about what advertising creativity is and when it might benefit a brand, it is not surprising that marketers often make the wrong decisions when investing in advertising creativity ([68]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we synthesize the fragmented literature on consumer response to advertising creativity. Based on a literature review, we develop a conceptual framework linking advertising creativity to consumer outcome responses in terms of ad, brand, and sales. Through a meta-analysis, we then integrate 878 effect sizes in the first quantitative empirical overview of the literature. Thus, we capture the impact of advertising creativity on 19 different consumer responses taken from 93 data sets in 67 papers. We thereby contribute a comprehensive and empirically grounded account of how and when advertising creativity works, providing researchers with generalized findings that can serve as benchmarks and a common foundation for future studies of this important topic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, we provide an empirically validated account of how advertising creativity works. The results show robust positive effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses but also inform researchers about the relative importance of various consumer responses to advertising creativity. Overall, effects are stronger for ad rather than brand responses (r =.491 vs..317) and for attitudinal rather than memory outcomes (all below.140). This suggests that the main advantages of advertising creativity are not grabbing attention and making ads memorable but rather the ability to foster positive ad and brand attitudes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we highlight that advertising creativity is different from originality. Effects on consumer response are greater when creativity is measured as a bipartite construct comprising of originality and appropriateness. Effects of originality only on ad and brand attitudes are comparatively small (.362 and.164), suggesting that marketers who view creativity as synonymous with originality will not reap the full benefits of investments in advertising creativity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we show that the different theoretical accounts used in the literature to explain how advertising creativity works are complementary. Although previously considered separately, affect transfer, processing, and signaling provide the best account when considered jointly. The results further show that processing is a key mediator of the effects, whereas originality fosters affect transfer and appropriateness signaling. When marketers invest in bipartite creativity, affect transfer and signaling occur in parallel to processing, which can explain the stronger effects of creativity compared with originality only.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, we find that when the three theoretical accounts are considered jointly, the effects of advertising creativity on brand response are not dependent on ad responses. This is in line with the signaling account of advertising creativity and suggests that to fully understand how advertising creativity works, marketers should assess consumer responses in terms of brand rather than ad outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For managers, the results provide guidance on how, when, and why to invest in advertising creativity. For example, advertising creativity leads to greater ad responses in high (vs. low) involvement communication contexts (.653 vs..340) and (marginally) for unfamiliar (vs. familiar) brands (.577 vs..435). The literature review also highlights the need for more studies on the relationship between advertising creativity and sales, as well as its effects in digital media contexts, two areas that are especially important given the ongoing debate about the value of advertising creativity in contemporary marketing practice.</p><a id="AN0146362523-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-2" title="Conceptual Framework">Conceptual Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1 presents the conceptual framework guiding the meta-analysis. We developed this framework on the basis of a review of the literature on consumer responses to advertising creativity. The framework focuses on consumer responses that have been empirically studied and distinguishes between immediate and outcome responses. The categorization of immediate responses is based on the three main theoretical accounts of how advertising creativity works found in the literature: affect transfer, processing, and signaling (i.e., consumer response in terms of affect, processing, and perceived signals at the time of exposure to creative advertising). The categorization of outcome variables is based on ad and brand responses and characterized in terms of attitudinal or memory responses (i.e., longer-lasting responses related to the ad and brand, such as attitudes, memory effects, and sales). The framework also highlights two moderators of these responses: definitions and assessments of advertising creativity and properties of the communication context (involvement and familiarity).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. How and when advertising creativity works: conceptual framework.aNot tested empirically due to lack of data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Whereas research on advertising creativity generally has found positive effects on immediate and outcome responses (for reviews, see [74]] and [77]]), empirical findings suggest that the effects vary between different types of consumer responses. Findings generally show that advertising creativity has benefits in terms of immediate responses, such as attention ([65]; [78]), positive affect ([30]; [86]), and signals, such as perceived sender effort ([19]; [50]), but results are inconsistent regarding when and how this might also lead to outcome responses, such as attitudes and intentions ([61]; [77]) or memory effects ([65]; [82]). Results also varied regarding whether attitude and memory outcomes are affected ([<a id="bib4up

Creativity is a general construct that has been widely researched in fields such as psychology and organizational behavior, as well as in marketing ([37]; [74]). Creativity can be used to describe individuals (e.g., an art director at an advertising agency), processes (e.g., design thinking methods used to brainstorm advertising campaigns), or outputs (e.g., the actual ad executions used in a marketing campaign). In this article, we adopt the output perspective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on the creativity literature ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref39" title="2">2</a>]; [33]; [73]), we define advertising creativity as advertising execution(s) that is (are) original and appropriate. This bipartite definition of creativity has been widely adapted in the marketing literature, in which the definition has been applied in advertising ([14]; [41]), new product development ([<a id="bib8up

					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref48" title="2">2</a>], a bipartite definition of creativity is required, because outputs that are original or unique but carry no use or meaning are perceived as weird or bizarre. However, any judgments of creativity are subjective and likely to vary across context and time. For example, judgments about originality and appropriateness in a work of art differ from the same judgments in an advertising context (even if the actual object being judged is the same). Similarly, judgments of the creativity of the same object can vary over time. In the art domain, for example, there are several artists who are now considered creative but whose art was controversial or even rejected in their time (e.g., Monet, Picasso, Dalí). Such works were initially seen as "weird" or "bizarre," mainly because the type of appropriateness expected of them at the time of creation was a literal representation of reality. Thus, these artists were redefined as creative later, when judgment of appropriateness changed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the advertising context, the best documented dimension of creativity is originality. This dimension has also been referred to as novelty, divergence, unexpectedness, and newness ([42]; [48]; [76]; [78]). Originality has positive effects on consumer responses to advertising, as originality makes advertising more likely to be attended and processed ([65]; [77]). Originality also has a positive effect on consumer response, as people have a predisposition to appreciate divergent stimuli and deem them intrinsically interesting ([86]). Advertising practitioners typically view originality as the most defining aspect of advertising creativity ([48]; [60]), especially when it comes to advertising creativity awards ([15]; [78]). Thus, it is not surprising that many scholars focus primarily or exclusively on originality when assessing advertising creativity ([49]; [65]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When it comes to appropriateness, this dimension complements originality by connecting the advertisement with brand strategy and consumer problem-solving abilities and goals ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref62" title="3">3</a>]; [25]; [60]; [78]). In the advertising literature, appropriateness is also referred to as relevance and usefulness (and when assessed by practitioners as "on strategy"; cf. [41]; [74]). Appropriateness as such has received much research attention (often using the term "relevance"; e.g., [31]). However, in contrast with originality, scholars rarely consider appropriateness to be an indicator of creativity in and of itself. Instead, researchers typically view appropriateness as a prerequisite for advertising to be interesting to its intended audience regardless of its level of creativity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Theoretically, it is clear that creativity is both originality and appropriateness. Some scholars also argue that additional dimensions could be needed to fully understand advertising creativity ([<a id="bib3up

They argue in favor of including a third advertising-specific dimension of creativity—namely, the quality of the ad execution, also referred to as artistry or production ([60]; [78]). In the literature, we distinguish four approaches to empirically assess advertising creativity. First, some studies measure advertising creativity as a holistic perception of the creativity of an ad, typically by using a single item "creative" or multiple creativity items that do not refer specifically to different dimensions (e.g., [71]). Second, other studies rely on only one dimension of advertising creativity (typically originality; e.g., [57]). Third, acknowledging the bipartite definition of creativity, some researchers use the interaction between originality and appropriateness as a creativity measure (e.g., [78]). Fourth, acknowledging the multidimensionality of the bipartite definition, some studies rely on measures of both originality and appropriateness ([42]), sometimes combined with one or more additional dimensions related to the production quality or artistic value ([60]; [68]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that researchers who focus on originality only (e.g., [57]; [65]) are likely to get different results from those who study creativity in terms of a bipartite (e.g., [60]; [78]). Although we cannot test the validity of different assessments, we propose that the best measure of advertising creativity should explain more variance in outcome response variables than alternative measures of creativity, leading to stronger effect sizes (for a similar argument, see [23]). The approach that has the highest explanatory value should also be the most managerially relevant. Given that creativity is defined as a combination of originality and appropriateness, we propose that the effect sizes should be stronger when both dimensions are considered and weaker when only originality is used.

In the literature review, it was apparent that little attention has been paid to such contextual moderators in the existing literature ([86]). However, we identified two theoretically relevant moderators: involvement and familiarity. Both variables have been found to affect consumer response to advertising in general, but of interest here is how they affect consumer responses to advertising creativity. Specifically, the literature suggests that advertising creativity (i.e., a combination of originality and appropriateness) has benefits regardless of the type of processing (peripheral vs. central; e.g., [10]) depending on these moderators.</p><a id="AN0146362523-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-5" title="Involvement">Involvement</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers' involvement with advertising reflects their level of interest in brand evaluation in any given context and has been found to moderate the effects of advertising processing and response (e.g., [56]; [59]). Specifically, consumer responses to advertising differ depending on how much effort goes into processing it. For example, high involvement with a product category motivates consumers to pay attention to and actively process advertising. When involvement is low, attention is typically allocated to other things, and consequently, ad processing is limited and utilizes few processing resources and peripheral cues (e.g., [10]; [56]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although advertising creativity has typically been thought of as an attention-grabbing device (e.g., [65]), implying that it would work best in low-involvement contexts (where it can foster situational involvement; [10]), creativity has been found to have additional processing advantages when it comes to high-involvement contexts ([79]; [86]). In a low-involvement context, any additional processing stimulated by a creative ad is likely to be shallow ([56]; [86]). In a high-involvement context, however, additional processing makes consumers more likely to actively assess the claims. In this context, the combination of originality and appropriateness fosters more open-minded and less defensive processing of claims made ("willingness to delay closure"; [39]; [86]). This means that consumers will be more open to new information about the brand and less likely to use defensive mechanisms when processing advertising messages that are communicated creatively. Whereas advertising creativity in low-involvement contexts stimulates more affective processing, in high-involvement contexts creativity influences affective and cognitive processing ([86]). In both contexts, advertising creativity should have a positive impact on consumer response, but in a high-involvement context, in-depth processing, coupled with the willingness to delay closure, makes the effects stronger.

Consumer response to advertising has been found to vary with familiarity ([55]; [75]). Specifically, the effects of advertising are generally stronger for unfamiliar than familiar brands. This effect is due to consumers not being able to draw from previous experiences (neither their own nor the experiences of others) when evaluating unfamiliar brands, which makes advertising more important for these brands. However, advertising for unfamiliar brands wears out faster ([11]). For marketers of unfamiliar brands, this poses a challenge, as they need advertising to build familiarity but also must be careful about how they advertise to avoid negative reactions caused by (too much) repetition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Familiarity has also been found to moderate the effects of advertising creativity in terms of familiarity with the specific ad ([14]; [65]).

The latter finding is in line with results showing that advertising creativity (in terms of originality) helps draw attention to familiar ads that might otherwise be overlooked due to tedium ([65]). For unfamiliar brands, these advantages are more important ([11]). Overall, this suggests that advertising creativity should be beneficial for unfamiliar and familiar brands, but given its attention-grabbing character ([65]), the immediate wear-in effect that it can generate ([14]), and the higher impact of advertising in general ([55]; [75]), the effects should be stronger for unfamiliar brands.

The affect transfer model focuses on the potential of creativity to evoke positive feelings that spill over into consumer responses to the ad and brand (i.e., regarding "positive affect" as a key mediator; [86]). The processing model focuses primarily on the ability of creativity to get consumers interested in the ad and brand (i.e., "ad processing" is the key mediator; [78]). The signaling model proposes that creativity works as a marketing signal, directly influencing perceptions about the sender and thus, consumer responses to the brand (i.e., "perceived sender effort" is the key mediator; [19]).[<a id="bib5up

This explanation focuses on the ability of affectively loaded information to transfer into other, more or less unrelated, targets. In the advertising creativity context, the affect transfer model builds on the fact that consumers generally like creative ads ([71]; [77]). Processing creative ads is seen as intrinsically motivating and pleasurable ([71]; [86]), which means that consumers are likely to experience positive affect while exposed to such advertising. This positive affect spills over to the ad and brand, leading them to be evaluated more favorably ([30]; [86]). According to this explanation, the positive effects are driven by creative ads being more enjoyable and liked, and the positive feelings that this stimulates. Although theoretically exceptions might occur, as may be the case for executions of fear appeal advertising that combines originality and appropriateness, the reviewed literature on advertising creativity unanimously provides empirical support for positive reactions to advertising creativity. Thus,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is mediated by positive affect.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0146362523-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-9" title="Processing Model">Processing Model</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Explanations of how advertising works often draw on information processing models (e.g., [56]; [59]). Specifically, they explain consumer responses to advertising based on different levels of ad processing. This is also a common explanation for the effects of advertising creativity. Creativity is said to stand out, thus making creative ads more likely to be attended to and processed ([78]; [86]). This means that more creative advertising stimulates more ad processing, resulting in longer exposure and greater attention ([30]; [65]), which has positive effects on consumer outcome response. According to this explanation, the positive effects of creativity are driven by creativity being more interesting and therefore, processed more. Thus,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H6: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is mediated by ad processing.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0146362523-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-10" title="Signaling Model">Signaling Model</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third explanation for the effects of advertising creativity focuses on creativity as a signal of brand and company ability (e.g., [19]; [50]). This model builds on research on marketing signals ([44]; [46]), showing that certain behaviors on behalf of a firm (e.g., offering long-lasting warranties) can be used to signal unobservable quality to consumers. For example, advertising spending (i.e., monetary investments) has been found to work as a signal of brand quality ([45]; [47]). Similarly, advertising creativity has been found to be perceived by consumers as a signal that the sender has invested effort (in terms of time and money) in their brand ([18]; [19]). Through creative advertising, a brand conveys that it is committed to its advertising and its products, which is interpreted as a signal that positively affects how the brand is perceived and evaluated. According to this explanation, the positive effects of creativity are driven by creativity signaling effort on behalf of the sender, thus affecting the ad and brand positively. In contrast to the other two models, this account considers process reactions to creative advertising to be about the immediate perceptions of the <em>brand</em> rather than the <em>ad</em>.

Given that the initial models focus on different variables, we propose several additional relationships in the full model. First, ad processing is likely to spur stronger perceptions of sender effort. This is because processing facilitates a more careful understanding of the ad ([77]), which should, in turn, enhance perceptions of sender effort stimulated by advertising creativity. Second, affective responses can influence not only the ad and brand but also perceptions of sender effort. The underlying logic is, again, affect transfer ([86]). Furthermore, affect and processing should be positively related, because feelings ease processing (mood theory), and easy processing is experienced as a good feeling (processing fluency theory).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

To be able to assess the relevance of different assessments of creativity, we included all studies that identify as "ad* creativity" studies independent of their definition and operationalization of advertising creativity. This means that we also included all studies that relied on advertising stimuli judged to be creative (even if they did not use the bipartite definition), as well as studies that investigated the two main dimensions of creativity, even if they did not use the term "creativity" ([51]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To identify relevant papers, we first referred to review articles that provide an overview of previous research on advertising creativity (e.g., [74]). We applied an ancestry tree search by searching all papers that refer to the review papers that were available in the Web of Science database. Second, we performed a keyword search of electronic databases (e.g., ABI/INFORM, Emerald, Elsevier, EBSCO, and ProQuest Dissertation Publishing) using "advertising creativity," "ad creativity," "advertisement creativity," and "advertising creative," "ad creative," and "advertisement creative" as key words, followed by a search with key words that relate to the two main dimensions of advertising creativity ("original*," "novel*," "newn*," "unexpected*," "divergen*," "innovati*," "incongru*," "relevan*," "appropriate*," "useful*," and "meaningful*" combined with "advertis*"). The database search was complemented by a search on Google Scholar. Third, we performed a manual search of the journal outlets that turned out to be major sources for articles on advertising creativity. Fourth, once we identified a paper, we examined the references in a search for additional studies. The search period covered all papers (published and unpublished) that were available by December 2018. The retrieval approach was consistent with recommendations in the literature ([35]) and closely followed the steps taken in recent meta-analyses published in marketing ([69]; [88]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After identifying manuscripts for potential inclusion in the data set, we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine which manuscripts to retain. We included all empirical studies that measured or manipulated advertising creativity (as described previously) and provided estimates on its effects on consumer responses. We excluded any manuscripts outside this scope. For instance, we excluded studies that investigated nonconsumer response to creative ads (e.g., advertisers; [84]), or studies on creative media choice, but not creative ads ([16]). We also excluded studies that failed to provide sufficient data for the meta-analysis and for which necessary data could not be retrieved from the authors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To avoid duplications in the data set, a document with original analyses and findings by the same authors (e.g., journal article, working paper, conference paper) is called a "paper." In some papers, the authors analyzed more than one distinct data set (e.g., a paper with several experiments), while some data sets were analyzed in more than one paper (e.g., a study that was published as a conference paper and a journal paper). The analysis is based on data sets. Each data set can provide single or multiple effect sizes that refer to the effect of advertising creativity on any consumer response variable. The search resulted in 67 usable papers covering 93 data sets (see Web Appendix Table&nbsp;1). The sample includes journal articles, book chapters, working papers, unpublished theses, and conference proceedings, thus reducing the risk of a biased representation of the state of research because of the source of publication.

To determine whether the full model provided a better explanation than the three parsimonious models that were nested within it, we compared the fit of the full model that was restricted to any of the nested models with the fit of the full model with unrestricted paths. The model fit worsened significantly when it was restricted to the affect transfer model (Δχ<sup>2</sup>/d.f. = 1,629.935/8, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), the processing model (Δχ<sup>2</sup>/d.f. = 1,733.093/8, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), or the signaling model (Δχ<sup>2</sup>/d.f. = 1,528.916/8, <em>p</em> &lt;.001). Thus, the full model provides an explanation that goes beyond the explanatory power of each nested model; H<sub>8</sub> was empirically supported. Interestingly, in the full model, the mediating effect of A<sub>ad</sub> on A<sub>brand</sub> dropped from around.5 in the individual models to a marginally significant effect of.078 (Δχ<sup>2</sup>/d.f. = 96.512/1, <em>p</em> &lt;.001). This suggests that the effect of advertising creativity on brand response is only weakly mediated by ad response, which adds additional insight into RQ<sub>1</sub> about the effects of creativity on ad versus brand response.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We performed two additional analyses to further explore how well the three models explain the effects of creativity on consumer response. First, we compared how much of the variance in A<sub>ad</sub> was explained directly by advertising creativity and indirectly by either process suggested by the three individual models (we could not apply this comparison to A<sub>brand</sub>, as there was no direct effect of creativity on A<sub>brand</sub> in the model). We computed the proportion of mediation as the ratio of indirect to total effect; that is, the indirect path(s) was/were divided by the sum of the direct path and indirect path(s) ([36]). The proportion of mediation via positive affect was 26.8%, via ad processing was 28.3%, and via perceived sender effort was 33.9%. When we tested the mediation paths in the full model against each other by restricting two corresponding paths at a time (see Web Appendix Table&nbsp;3), we found no differences between the paths from advertising creativity to any of the three mediators (positive affect, ad processing, and sender effort). However, the effect of sender effort on A<sub>ad</sub> was significantly different and stronger than the effect of either positive affect or ad processing on A<sub>ad</sub>. The findings indicate that signaling explains more variance in A<sub>ad</sub> than the two other models, thus providing the strongest explanation for the effect of creativity on A<sub>ad</sub> of the three models.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we compared the theoretical explanation offered by the full model between the two dimensions of creativity by using correlation matrices that considered the variable relationships with either originality or appropriateness instead of creativity (see Web Appendix Table&nbsp;4). The results showed that the positive effects on ad processing are equally strong for both dimensions. However, affect transfer mainly explains the effects of originality as indicated by the fact that the path from creativity to positive affect was statistically significant for originality, but not for appropriateness. When it comes to signaling, however, appropriateness seems more important, as indicated by the significantly stronger link between creativity and sender effort.</p><a id="AN0146362523-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-19" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0146362523-20"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-20" title="Summary of Findings">Summary of Findings</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we offer a comprehensive synthesis of the effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses. The study highlights the importance of advertising creativity by showing robust positive effects on a wide range of immediate and outcome responses. The effects are stronger for ad responses compared with brand responses and for attitudinal compared with memory outcomes. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are weaker when creativity is assessed as originality only, compared with a bipartite comprising originality and appropriateness. This suggests that the effects of advertising creativity go beyond those of originality alone. The results further show that advertising creativity has stronger effects in high-involvement contexts, and that effects on ad response are (marginally) stronger for unfamiliar brands. Furthermore, we find empirical support for all three theoretical accounts (affect transfer, processing, and signaling) used in the literature, but also that a full model (where the three accounts are considered jointly) best explains the effects of advertising creativity on consumer outcome response. In the full model, the effect of the three advertising creativity mediators (positive affect, ad processing, and perceived sender effort) on brand response is only marginally mediated by ad response, suggesting that although ad responses are generally more affected than brand responses, they are not needed for advertising creativity affect brand response. Additional analyses show that affect transfer mainly explains the effects caused by originality and that signaling provides the strongest account of advertising creativity in terms of ad response.</p><a id="AN0146362523-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-21" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although marketing researchers and practitioners tend to agree that advertising creativity is important, there are contrasting views on what advertising creativity is, and how and when it can lead to positive outcomes. Through this meta-analysis, we provide a synthesis of the growing, but dispersed, literature on advertising creativity, thus building a common foundation for future studies of this important topic. The results inform about important outcome variables and moderators of advertising creativity effects. The meta-analytic findings can serve as benchmarks for future advertising creativity studies, as well as for studies dealing with other ad execution elements. Future findings can be compared against the meta-analytic results in terms of explained variance as a measure of advertising effectiveness. The results also have several implications for future studies of advertising creativity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, we offer an empirically validated understanding of how advertising creativity works. The pattern of results suggests that advertising creativity has a role to play in stimulating positive consumer responses that goes beyond being a source of attention. If the attention-grabbing nature of advertising creativity were the key benefit, its effects should be greater for memory rather than attitudinal responses, and in communication contexts where consumers are less likely to attend to and process ads, such as for low-involvement products and for unfamiliar brands ([19]; [65]), which is not in line with the empirical results. Although claims that advertising creativity enables advertising to "cut through clutter" and make advertising more memorable ([65]) are true, they risk directing focus away from attitudinal consumer responses, which are more affected. The fact that advertising creativity has stronger effects in high-involvement contexts suggests that processing is important for the effects to occur. It also raises the question of what to expect from advertising creativity in contexts where consumers are unlikely to pay attention to and process ads, such as digital and mobile media. The meta-analysis did not include any such studies, but the results suggest that effects should be weaker in media such as smartphones where focus is very directed at other focal tasks ([58]). At the same time, effects should be stronger for advertising content in own channels and in media where consumers voluntarily seek out advertising ([70]). However, future research is needed to explicitly study the role of advertising creativity in these contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we contribute insights into how to define and assess advertising creativity. In line with the creativity literature ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref179" title="2">2</a>]; [73]), the results indicate that creativity is not just about originality. A bipartite definition and multidimensional assessments of creativity offer better explanations of the effects (for a similar argument, see [<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref181" title="3">3</a>] and [60]). This suggests that researchers should be mindful when using the term advertising creativity and restrict it to studies of original <em>and</em> appropriate ads. When studying original advertising only, the term creativity should be avoided. It also suggests that the reliance on advertising awards as an operationalization of advertising creativity is not valid, as such awards tend to focus on originality ([15]; [41]). The fact that empirical studies have found positive effects of original and award-winning ads, however, is reassuring, as the results suggest that, if anything, those studies underestimate the effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of how advertising creativity works. The findings show that the different theoretical accounts of advertising creativity available in the literature are complementary, but also that they have different relationships with creativity dimensions. Our meta-analytic path analysis show that originality primarily stimulates affect transfer, whereas appropriateness is more important for signaling. We also find that signaling has the highest explanatory value. Again, this reinforces the notion that a bipartite view of advertising creativity is most relevant, as ads that combine originality with appropriateness allow these mechanisms to work simultaneously, whereas original ads do not. It also suggests that future studies of advertising creativity should include more comprehensive theoretical frameworks than what has previously been the case. Together, these insights offer the basic building blocks for a more complete processing model of advertising creativity called for by [85].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, the finding that the three theoretical mediators of advertising creativity have direct effects on brand response (A<sub>brand</sub>) that are only weakly mediated through ad response (A<sub>ad</sub>) adds further to our understanding of how advertising creativity works.[<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref186" title="9">9</a>] It shows that although creativity has stronger effects on ad responses than brand responses, these effects are not necessarily dependent on ad response. Again, this pattern can be understood in terms of the combination of (high) originality and (high) appropriateness in creative ads. In line with [78] finding that originality has advantages in terms of attention and that appropriateness stimulates downstream effects and brand response, advertising creativity allows the two to work in parallel, which also has more direct brand outcomes. This finding is in line with the signaling account of advertising creativity that suggests a more direct effect on the brand. For researchers, it suggests that when studying the effects of advertising creativity, brand (and sales) responses must be included through direct measures rather than relying on A<sub>ad</sub> or other ad responses as proxies of such effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, the empirical results provide convincing evidence of the positive effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses and thus highlight the need for marketing scholars to consider not only media investments (ad spend; [38]; [80]) but also creativity investments in models of how advertising work.</p><a id="AN0146362523-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-22" title="Managerial Contributions">Managerial Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For marketers, we contribute a systematic account and empirical evidence of the value of advertising creativity. Specifically, we offer important insights into how, when, and why to invest in advertising creativity. Given the ongoing debate about the value of creativity in advertising ([27]; [66]), this contribution is timely and useful. It also shows no evidence of advertising creativity becoming less (or more) effective over time.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When it comes to <em>how</em> to invest, [68] found that many marketers make suboptimal decisions regarding investments in advertising creativity. We suggest that a tendency to focus on originality might be the root of this problem. Creativity is more than originality, and by incorporating appropriateness consumer response will be more positive. To achieve this, marketers must find ways to assess advertising creativity. This is easier said than done, given that creativity judgments are subjective and vary across context and time. We find that award-winning ads lead to marginally weaker brand response, suggesting that consumer rather than professional judgments should be used. This supports [<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref193" title="3">3</a>] argument that marketers should involve consumers more in advertising development. Whereas there is a growing literature focusing on consumers as cocreators of advertising ([17]; [81]), consumers could also be engaged as prejudges of advertising. A post hoc analysis of the role of ad judges provided additional support for this notion. Specifically, we coded a variable that distinguished between ads that were judged to be creative by either consumers, by experts, or selected from award shows. As some studies did not provide details on ad judges, we first ran analysis of variance models for a combination of all three outcome responses (A<sub>ad</sub>, A<sub>brand</sub>, and intentions) to ensure sufficiently large sample sizes. We found significant effects (F(<a id="bib2up

The effects were stronger when consumers judged advertising creativity (.373) compared with experts (.300) or award shows (.193). When we analyzed the three responses separately, the effect held for A<sub>brand</sub> and intentions, but not for A<sub>ad</sub>. As brand outcomes are more valuable for marketers, this reinforces the potential in allowing consumers to (pre)judge advertising creativity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When it comes to <em>when</em> to invest, the results suggest that advertising creativity has positive effects in general but also that the effects are stronger for attitudinal rather than memory response and marginally stronger in audiovisual media (TV/movies vs. print/outdoor). Furthermore, the effects are stronger for high-involvement contexts. For marketers, this challenges the established view of advertising as a tool for gaining attention and suggests that creativity is especially valuable in contexts where consumers are likely to process advertising. Although we studied product involvement, this logic should also hold for media context involvement, meaning that creativity is more likely to work in situations where more focused ad processing occurs. Thus, advertising creativity should be more important for media contexts in which consumers voluntarily direct their attention to, or are forced to focus directly on, advertising than in in media contexts that rely on incidental and divided attention (see also [17]; [70]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also find that advertising creativity has marginally stronger effects for unfamiliar compared with familiar brands. However, this effect is related only to ad rather than brand response. As suggested by [11], ad response is a strong indicator of brand response for unfamiliar brands (as consumers have little other information on which to base evaluations), suggesting that this finding is still managerially important. By investing in advertising creativity, such brands can increase the value of their advertising to consumers ("advertising equity"; [70]). Taken together, this suggests that advertising creativity is especially valuable when establishing a new brand in the market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When it comes to <em>why</em> advertising creativity works, the mechanisms underlying its positive effects are more profound than many marketers might think. An in-depth understanding of how affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly contribute to brand response help make investments in advertising creativity less risky ([85]). Although marketers who focus on originality can expect positive effects due to affect transfer, they will miss out on the potential effects of signaling and appropriateness. By investing in bipartite advertising creativity, marketers can increase the chances of their ads being liked, processed, and interpreted as signals of what the brand has to offer. It also means that there is little risk that positive effects will be for ad response only.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a managerial perspective, the effects of signaling are especially important to consider, as they offer the strongest explanation for the effects on ad response and because appropriateness is especially important in high-involvement and low-familiarity contexts, where advertising creativity also has the strongest effects. It suggests that advertisements can produce effects by way of the signals they send rather than the specific messages they convey. Signals are especially important in situations where there is information asymmetry between marketers and their customers ([13]; [46]). This is arguably the case for unfamiliar brands and high-involvement products as well as in other situations where the decision-making process is complex, such as in business-to-business, business-to-government, and recruitment contexts ([13]; [18]). In fact, recent research suggests that the effect of advertising signals extends beyond consumers to other stakeholders, such as employees and investors ([18]), though this is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><a id="AN0146362523-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362523-23" title="Limitations and Further Research">Limitations and Further Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given the nature of a meta-analysis, we could study only consumer responses that previous researchers had investigated. This means, for example, that we could not consider potential negative effects of creativity on, for example, confusion, negative affect, and fear appeals. However, we found a marginally significant negative effect of complexity, suggesting that the potential downsides of creativity warrant further investigation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, the literature review revealed a lack of studies on the effects of advertising creativity on sales (for an exception, see [68]) and the effects of advertising creativity in digital contexts, such as the effects of advertising creativity on social media influencer engagement ([34]). Future studies are needed to explore how advertising creativity works in those contexts. Studies linking the effects of advertising creativity to behavioral measures, such as brand choice or sales, seem especially important. This could be done by combining quantitative (advertising spend) and qualitative (advertising creativity) assessments of advertising investments with behavioral outcomes, for example, adding advertising creativity in marketing-mix models or adding sales as a dependent variable in experimental studies. In such efforts, additional moderators, such as clutter ([65]) and repetition ([14]), should also be considered.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As another limitation, the present study focused on consumer responses to advertising creativity only. There are several related issues in the literature that could contribute to our understanding of advertising creativity. For example, there is a vast literature on creative processes in agencies that foster creativity in advertising ([29]; [40]), and synthesizing this literature should bring additional insights to marketers. Relatedly, there should be room to further integrate the literature on advertising creativity with creativity research focusing on other marketing contexts ([<a id="bib8up

It should also be noted that all three accounts have primarily been developed using experimental approaches.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib6"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib6up" id="bib_upbib6" title="6">6</a>  2 We excluded the following variables from further analysis (mean correlations in parentheses): negative thoughts (−.105, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), other thoughts (.047, n.s.), negative feelings (.083, n.s.), actual creativity (.189, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), brand familiarity (.192, <em>p</em> &lt;.10), presumed influence (.309, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), and willingness to pay (.429, <em>p</em> &lt;.10).</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib7"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib7up" id="bib_upbib7" title="7">7</a>  3 Of 878 effect sizes, we converted 21 from coefficients in multivariate regressions via the formula suggested by [64]. These parameters were partial correlations, and therefore, we checked whether they had an influence on the meta-regression results by including a dummy variable that distinguishes between partial correlations and correlations. Because partial correlations did not appear in the set of correlations referring to A<sub>brand</sub>, the dummy was included in the A<sub>ad</sub> model only.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib8"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8up" id="bib_upbib8" title="8">8</a>  4 To further explore the role of originality and appropriateness in explaining these effects, we also tested several plausible interactions between creativity measurements and moderators (similar to the procedure in [75]). For A<sub>ad</sub>, we tested interactions between measurements (using dummy variables for originality, appropriateness, and multidimensions, the cell sizes for interactions with "interaction only" were too small to provide a robust analysis) and the hypothesized moderating variables (involvement, familiarity). The analysis showed a significant interaction effect for appropriateness × familiarity (b = −.239, SE =.062, t = 3.830, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), suggesting that appropriateness is more important for unfamiliar brands. There was also a significant interaction effect for appropriateness × involvement (b =.271, SE =.058, t = 4.643, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), suggesting that appropriateness is more important in high-involvement contexts. We conducted the same analysis for A<sub>brand</sub>, where we were able to test interactions between measurements focusing on originality and appropriateness (the cell sizes for "interaction only" and "multidimensional" were too small to provide a robust analysis). However, we did not find any statistically significant interactions.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib9"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib9up" id="bib_upbib9" title="9">9</a>  5 This suppression effect is especially interesting because the A<sub>ad</sub> and A<sub>brand</sub> relationship is typically very strong, as evidenced in previous meta-analyses (e.g., [7]]: r =.600 [# effect sizes = 33], [22]]: r =.581 [4], [24]]: r =.624 [11]).</em></p><a id="AN0146362523-26"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0146362523-26" title=" References  "> References  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em> Alba Joseph W., Wesley Hutchinson J.

In the voluntary-pay format, the seller asks all bidders to pay their own high bid. The authors explore motives and boundary conditions for compliance behavior based on internal and external triggers of social norms. The voluntary-pay format generates higher revenue than the winner-pay format for charity auctions, despite imperfect compliance, but it generates lower revenues in noncharity settings. To characterize bidding strategy, the authors study time to bid, auction choice, and jump bidding and find evidence that bidders in voluntary-pay auctions more commonly use jump bidding and late entry. The findings have important implications for marketing managers, augmenting the growing stream of empirical auction studies and work on corporate social responsibility. Specifically, combining an auction with a charitable cause may result in increased revenues, but managers should ensure that they are accounting for differential compliance rates between auction formats. Even if low-compliance bidders can be identified and screened out, doing so is not advantageous, because noncompliant bidders bid up prices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online Supplement: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.16.0476">http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.16.0476</a></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In a voluntary-pay auction format, all bidders—both winning and losing—are asked to pay their highest bid. This format contrasts with a winner-pay format, in which only the winners are asked to pay. Little is known about voluntary-pay auctions’ impact on auction revenue and how bidders bid in voluntary-pay auctions, their willingness to pay, and bidding strategies. This study addresses this lack by examining voluntary-pay and winner-pay auctions in charity and noncharity settings. We examine whether the voluntary-pay format increases collected revenues and, if so, whether this is merely a charity-related phenomenon or extends to noncharity settings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In winner-pay auctions, which include most commonly used nonphilanthropic auction formats, one bidder wins the item and pays for it. Although payment compliance is known to be imperfect even in legally unambiguous settings, payment enforcement is not generally an issue if the seller can ensure that payment is delivered prior to the buyer obtaining the item.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Payment compliance is a far greater problem in voluntary-pay auctions, where all bidders are asked to pay whether or not they win. Although a substantial theoretical literature has advocated the use of all-pay auctions, this body of theory largely assumes perfect payment compliance. Therefore, a pressing question is whether there is high payment compliance in legally unenforceable settings in which the participating bidder commits to pay regardless of winning, specifically in a voluntary-pay auction context. We examine the factors that influence this rate of compliance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To study the conditions that foster payment compliance, we test different appeals for compliance. Specifically, we explore motives and boundary conditions for compliance behavior based on internal and external triggers of positive (pride) versus negative (shame) social norms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we conduct two field studies to study voluntary-pay auctions and payment compliance in a real-world setting to determine whether this format offers any benefits. We study these issues on an active large-scale auction website with a strong reputation for charity auctions (though thiswebsite also runs noncharity auctions). It operates primarily in one major North American city and has raised $4 million for local charities in the past decade. The auctions run on the site are ascending-bid (English-language) auctions, and sellers have flexibility in terms of format.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In analyzing strategic considerations, we focus on three factors:</p><ol><li><span class="medium-normal"> The strategic interaction between jump bidding and late bidding in a field setting. This interaction is far more important in settings with contractual obligations for losing bidders, as waiting to bid might be a better option.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> The opportunity cost of entering a bid in an auction. This cost is far more important when entry involves a nonbinding contractual obligation—the opportunity cost being an alternative for obtaining the same item.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Contract compliance when social consequences may differ between settings: a noncharity setting, in which the social contract is with only the contracting party, and a charity setting, in which the social contract is broader.</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To study these factors, we estimate a model with four components: time to bid, auction choice, jump bid, and propensity to pay.</p><a id="AN0128990188-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-2" title="Background">Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0128990188-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-3" title="All-Pay Auctions in Philanthropic Settings">All-Pay Auctions in Philanthropic Settings</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The auctions we study are not strictly all-pay auctions owing to imperfect collection; therefore, we call these “voluntary-pay” auctions. They are motivated similarly to all-pay auctions: all bidders, including losing bidders, are asked to pay an amount equal to their highest bid. In all-pay auctions, payment compliance is assumed to be fully enforceable (which may be inconsistent with real constraints; Budig, Butler, and Murphy 1993; Posner 1977). Voluntary-pay auctions relax that full-enforceability assumption. In contrast to both these formats, in winner-pay auctions only the bidder with the highest bid is asked to pay. We summarize the differences between the winner-pay, all-pay, and voluntary-pay auction formats in Table 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All-pay noncharity auctions belong in the class of auctions that satisfy revenue equivalence under standard conditions, even though, in general, revenue equivalence has not been established empirically (e.g., Gneezy and Smorodinsky 2006). However, this equivalence does not hold for ascending-bid all-pay auctions, which we use, because in dynamic all-pay auctions a bid reveals something about the value of the bidder. Another difference is that in the sealed-bid auction, bidders have no opportunity to place a second bid after they find that they are not the high bidder (and that they need to pay their bid anyway) and thus need to consider this possibility before placing a bid. In the ascending-bid auction, bidders can update their bids and adjust their strategy as the auction progresses. They are more likely to continue bidding due to the commitment already made, which may result in bidding frenzy (Heyman, Orhun, and Ariely 2004).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, in charity auctions, revenue equivalence between formats is not theoretically expected. When participation rates are exogenous and pledges are binding (neither is the case in the current study), all-pay charity auctions are expected to dominate other common formats in terms of revenues (Engers and McManus 2007; Goeree et al. 2005; Schram and Onderstal 2009).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Revenue in the voluntary-pay auction consists of the ending price and the compliance rate. Because compliance is not enforceable, revenue depends on losing bidders’ propensity to pay. However, bidders with a low propensity to pay are likely to bid more aggressively. Furthermore, we expect greater bidder entry into the voluntary-pay than into the all-pay auction, which also has a positive effect on ending price. Higher revenue is likely to result as long as a considerable proportion of losing bidders pay. However, this possibility may not hold for non-charity auctions, where bidders tend to be less likely to enter and may bid less aggressively.</p><a id="AN0128990188-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-4" title="Payment Compliance">Payment Compliance</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Issues with payment compliance are commonplace in consumer auctions. For example, eBay has a help page for sellers who do not receive payments.1 In philanthropic settings, the compliance problem is exacerbated. Even with the most explicit legal contracts, perfect enforcement of social responsibility is nearly impossible from a legal standpoint (e.g., Budig, Butler, and Murphy 1993; Posner 1977).2 However, in recent years theoretical and experimental articles have advocated the use of the all-pay auction, particularly for charity. These articles, which we discuss next, offer assurance that all-pay auctions are sound under the assumption that enforcement is perfect.</p><a id="AN0128990188-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-5" title="Background on Field Studies">Background on Field Studies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All-pay field studies and endogenous entry. A comparison of revenues for sealed-bid auction formats—including all-pay charity auctions, first-price charity auctions, and second-price charity auctions—revealed that all-pay auctions were revenue-dominated by winner-pay auctions, a result the authors attributed to low participation and low bids (Carpenter, Holmes, and Matthews 2008). This highlights the importance of accounting for endogenous entry, which we do. However, that finding emerged in a sealed-bid context, in which jump bidding and timing do not play a role, and with binding payment with perfect compliance—possible in the smaller controlled setting.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another study also used a sealed-bid format to compare voluntary contribution mechanisms, lottery, and all-pay auctions in a door-to-door fundraising field experiment (Onderstal, Schram, and Soetevent 2013). Results indicated that the all-pay condition performed worse than all other formats owing to lower participation—reinforcing our focus on endogenous participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A field experiment on Taskcn, a large Chinese crowdsourcing site, modeled the submissions of solutions as a first-price sealed-bid all-pay auction, because all submitters had to expend some effort regardless of whether they won (Liu et al. 2014).

This practice is common in empirical auction research (for examples, see Table 2). Although this approach would be unacceptable in laboratory methodology, it is not only acceptable but also desirable in field methodology. In field auctions, the notion of ceteris paribus cannot be routinely assumed between auctions run at different times. Therefore, it is important to run alternative formats during approximately the same time frame. Second, one cannot typically exclude real-world bidders from bidding in other formats or designs that overlap. Third, giving bidders a choice between auctions is advantageous because it indicates preference. Study 3’s approach clearly has shortcomings, and we urge readers to be cautious in comparing formats in this study, because comparisons are based on mixed experimental manipulations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/130n1.jpg" alt="130n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 1 Core Principles of Different Auction Types"><em>TABLE: TABLE 1 Core Principles of Different Auction Types</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">Winner-Pay</th><th valign="top">All-Pay</th><th valign="top">Voluntary-Pay</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">The winner is the bidder with the highest bid</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The winner must pay to obtain the item</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">The loser is asked to pay his or her highest bid</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Payment is enforceable</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">There are revenue equivalences in noncharity settings under mainstream assumptions</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes for sealed-bid formats, but not dynamic</td><td valign="top">No</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">There are revenue equivalences in charity settings under mainstream assumptions</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bidder entry</td><td valign="top">Costless</td><td valign="top">Costly</td><td valign="top">Costless to costly depending on bidder’s propensity to pay</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Defensive Bidding Strategies</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Effectiveness of jump bidding to reduce competition</td><td valign="top">Low</td><td valign="top">High</td><td valign="top">Medium</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Effectiveness of late bidding to reduce commitment</td><td valign="top">N.A.</td><td valign="top">High</td><td valign="top">Medium</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><a id="AN0128990188-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-8" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The hypotheses are summarized in the conceptual framework in Figure 1. We first identify the conditions that foster payment compliance. Without payment compliance, voluntary-pay auctions will not generate any revenues from losing bidders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Social pressure is effective in generating compliance with costly social norms. Field experiments (held during elections) designed to explore whether positive (pride) or negative (shame) social pressure is effective in reinforcing voting (the social norm) revealed that negative pressure was a stronger motivator (Panagopoulos 2010). More closely related to our current work is research on tax compliance that showed social pressure to be critical in increasing payment compliance in tax scenarios (Bobek and Hatfield 2003). However, results revealed that moral obligation—the intrinsic pressure—is key in that respect, thus creating what we call internal social pressure, which primes intrinsic motives. We distinguish between internal and external social pressure, as well as between negative and positive framing. The manipulations examine appeals to internal moral code versus external social pressure for compliance (Trevino 1986). We contrast positive versus negative social appeals for compliance, wherein positive and negative appeals can be through either external consequences (Bearden and Rose 1990; Burke and Logsdon 1996) or internal consequences (Yi 1990). We state these relationships in a single hypothesis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1a: Social pressure increases payment compliance by bidders in voluntary-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results of a charity field experiment with various formats conducted in preschools revealed that participation in the all-pay format is lower than in the other formats (Carpenter,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Holmes, and Matthews 2008), also observed by Schram and Onderstal (2009). Thus, as we state in H2b, owing to costly entry in voluntary-pay auctions, bidder participation is expected to be lower. In addition, the presence of social pressure, which (per H1a) increases pressure to pay, is expected to further decrease entry, as potential bidders who anticipate the increased compliance pressure will not enter the auction. Accordingly, we conjecture that social pressure reduces participation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1b: Social pressure decreases participation in voluntary-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Theoretically, the expectation is that although individual bidders reduce their willingness to pay in all-pay auctions, total revenues are higher in all-pay auctions than in any other form of winner-pay auction when all potential bidders participate (Engers and McManus 2007; Goeree et al. 2005). However, with endogenous participation (Liu et al. 2014), entry in all-pay auctions is generally highly sensitive to incentives. Accordingly, when bidders enter because of social pressure (per H1a), a negative incentive, we expect that (applying similar rationale as for H1b) they are willing to pay less (Carpenter, Holmes, and Matthews 2008), resulting in the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1c: Social pressure reduces bidders’ willingness to pay in voluntary-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Choice of auction format. The remaining hypotheses pertain to the theory for the charity setting with choice between formats. The choice is between a voluntary-pay and a winner-pay format for the same item. We focus on bidders’ propensity to pay (if they lose) in the voluntary-pay auction. Conceivably, some degree of adverse selection may occur whereby bidders with lower propensity to pay (upon losing) find engaging in the voluntary-pay auction to be less costly in expectation. Adverse selection in auction choice has been previously documented (Dewan and Hsu 2004), and we extend this to format choice in auctions, resulting in the following hypothesis:</p><p

Bidder entry is a particularly problematic dimension in a voluntary-pay context, because it can result in complete reversal of revenue predictions (e.g., Carpenter, Holmes, and Matthews 2008). However, in contrast to prior work using sealed-bid auctions (Carpenter, Holmes, and Matthews 2008), we consider an ascending-bid format, in which entry tends to be less costly (because entry cost is generally lower than the amount pledged). As a result, more bidders should enter an ascending-bid auction than into a sealed-bid auction, but overall we expect that the number of bidders will be lower in the voluntary-pay auction than in the winner-pay auction owing to the financial commitment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2b: Fewer bidders enter voluntary-pay auctions than enter winner-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Jump bidding. Do bidders use jump bidding and time to bid strategically to reduce competition (e.g., Isaac, Salmon, and Zillante 2007)? Jump bidding can be effective in deterring competitors from entry by signaling aggressiveness when bidding is costly (e.g., Avery 1998; Easley and Tenorio 2004). If bidding is costly, this aspect makes the auction an all-pay variant. Thus, jump bidding is a critical aspect of the present investigation into voluntary-pay auctions, because it can have animportant deterrence potential owing to the costly commitment by all bidders. Jump bids do not have that deterrence potential in winner-pay auctions because losing bids do not entail a financial commitment. Thus, we expect that if jump bids are an effective deterrent, then in voluntary-pay auctions large jump bids (especially early in the bidding process) will deter other competitors from entering or continuing to bid, thereby increasing the likelihood of winning an auction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3a: Jump bidding occurs more frequently in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Late bidding. Late bidding can be effective in avoiding early commitment and bidding wars (Roth and Ockenfels 2002). Given the entry (commitment) costs in voluntary-pay auctions, bidders will have a greater incentive to avoid early commitment and reduce competition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3b: Late bidding occurs more frequently in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Effect of propensity to pay on bid pledges.. In a voluntary-pay auction, a bid pledge is equal to the highest bid by a bidder. When people make ethical choices in hypothetical scenarios with no commitment mechanism, they pledge to make ethical choices that they do not adhere to in incentivized scenarios (FeldmanHall et al. 2012). Likewise, bidders who have a lower propensity to pay (upon losing) are expected to bid (pledge) higher in voluntary-pay auctions, because if they do not win the auction they are likely to default on the losing-bidder payment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4: Bidders with a higher propensity to pay tend to have a lower willingness to pay in voluntary-pay auctions than bidders with a lower propensity to pay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Bid pledges in auction format. Drawing on economic theory (Isaac, Pevnitskaya, and Salmon 2010), we predict that for both charity and noncharity settings, both willingness to pay and the winning bid in the voluntary-pay auction are lower than in the winner-pay format. The intuition is that in the voluntary-pay format, bidders have to allow for the probability of losing the auction and still paying their bids, so bidders will not bid up to their valuations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5: Bid pledges are lower in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Auction revenue. Current theory posits that in charity settings, revenues will be higher with all-pay auctions than with winner-pay auctions, given exogenous entry and full compliance from nonwinning bidders (Engers and McManus 2007; Goeree et al. 2005). The basic intuition is that in a winner-pay charity auction, a bidder who outbids a competitor forgoes a positive externality associated with the competing bidder’s contribution. In contrast, in all-pay charity auctions, competing bidders pay irrespective of whether they win, so the issue of forgoing competitors’ contributions by outbidding them does not arise. This result has a positive effect on revenue in all-pay charity auctions, despite the expected adverse effect on bidder entry. We expect that this difference in revenue will be preserved or be even greater in the voluntary-pay auction, because payment by losing bidders is not enforced. Bidders with low propensity to pay may drive up prices, because losing bidders will be less concerned about paying, as the money goes to charity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H6: Total revenue in voluntary-pay auctions is higher than in winner-pay auctions.</p><a id="AN0128990188-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-10" title="Study 1: Compliance Behavior for Different Triggers of Social Norms">Study 1: Compliance Behavior for Different Triggers of Social Norms</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Of importance in the analysis is the rate of compliance. Study 1 tests different appeals for compliance in voluntary-pay charity auctions. Specifically, we explore motives and boundary conditions for compliance behavior based on internal and external triggers of social norms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We report on an experiment involving 125 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants in five treatments. The experiment is a 1 + 2 · 2 design with the following conditions: benchmark, negative internal, negative external, positive internal, and positive external. Appendix A shows the scenarios used. The benchmark condition included only the nonitalicized text. (None of the text was in italics when shown to participants—italics are for this exposition only.) The square brackets contain the manipulated text in the 2 · 2 conditions. The manipulations enable us to examine appeals to internal moral code versus external social pressure for compliance (Trevino 1986).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For each manipulation, we elicited the highest bid for each of the two formats of winner-pay and voluntary-pay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expected bidders to pay far higher amounts in the winner-pay auction, but an internal validity check is still necessary. One relevant construct for comparison of manipulations is the difference in the highest bids between winner-pay and voluntary-pay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The primary issues are compliance and format choice, and particularly the trade-off between the two. If we compel people to pay—either legally (not an option here) or socially (which is investigated here)—then they will pay, but that comes at the cost of reduced entry and more cautious bidding. We observe this particularly for the negative internal and positive internal conditions, which are characterized by very high compliance but low choice of the voluntary-pay auctions (Table 3). The positive internal condition has the added disadvantage of a large drop (25%) in willingness to pay in the voluntary-pay format relative to the benchmark. Low entry combined with low bids mean that the higher compliance cannot possibly compensate ina terms of revenue. An attempted manipulation through positive appeals to internal norms would not have been effective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The external comparisons provide the best of both worlds. They increase compliance even more than internal appeals but also raise preference for the voluntary-pay auction. In the case of positive external appeal, the appeal resulted in higher willingness to pay. In summary:</p><ol><li><span class="medium-normal"> Negative and positive external social pressure both result in a significantly higher likelihood of paying than internal social pressure.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Internal social pressure—negative or positive—improves the likelihood of paying over the benchmark of no social pressure.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> External negative or positive social pressure changes format choice in favor of voluntary-pay, indicating that decision makers derive value from public acknowledgment.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Internal pressure—negative or positive—relative to the benchmark setting improves the likelihood of paying but does not significantly change format preference, perhaps because it confers no additional benefit to subjects beyond the benchmark.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> The positive internal pressure condition has the highest willingness-to-pay difference between formats, with willingness to pay in the voluntary-pay format being the lowest of all formats by nearly $100. It is possible that bidders perceive that format as a donation scheme. Thus, although positive internal pressure increases compliance, it does so at a drop of approximately 40% in revenues. Negative internal pressure is a close second in terms of willingness-topay differences between formats.</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, we find that social pressure (whether internal or external, negative or positive) increases payment compliance compared with the benchmark without social pressure (t = 1.74, p = .042),3 providing strong support for H1a. We also find support for H1b that social pressure decreases participation in the voluntary-pay format, though only for (both positive and negative) external pressure (t = 1.83, p = .036) and not for internal pressure (t = .06, p = .48). Finally, we find no statistical support for H1c’s proposition that social pressure has a greater negative influence on willingness to pay in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions, for either internal pressure (t = .87, p = .19) or external pressure (t = .10, p = .46). We test this hypothesis through the difference in willingness to pay between the winner-pay and voluntary-pay auctions. Although we find a larger difference for positive and negative internal pressure, consistent with H1c, this difference is not statistically significant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, the conjecture that one can “guilt” participants into paying is correct, but the result may be a loss of revenues. External pressure is the exception, possibly because of conditionally higher conferred benefits such as higher social status.</p><a id="AN0128990188-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-11" title="Field Studies">Field Studies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our data for Studies 2 and 3 come from a local nonprofit auction website in a midsized metropolitan area in North America with a population greater than one million.

All treatments were identical with respect to items and differed only in auction format. For each format, we sold an identical batch consisting of 75 different products, for a total of 225 auctions (three identical replicates for the 75 products). Web Appendix A provides a detailed summary of the products sold.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, at any time, all 75 products were sold using a single auction format, and subjects were not exposed to the competing format within a week of the treatment. Recruitment did not mention the format and the products to be sold, and subjects found out about both only when they logged in to the auction site. They were given no indication that the same products would be sold in the future using a different format. All 75 auctions within a batch or format ran for four days. Auctions started at approximately 10 P.M. and ended at 10 P.M. on the last day with a 30-second interval between individual auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One day before the start of the auctions, all registered members received anemail announcing the upcoming auctions. In contrast to Study 3, they received no details about the auctions or the products sold. Details about the auction format (rules for the voluntary-pay auctions and payment-rule description) and the charity component (if present) were displayed on the front page of the auction website and in all individual auctions just above the bid box.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Each auction consisted of a picture and a product description. All auctions were ascending-bid auctions with a proxy bidding system, similar to eBay. Bidding started at $.01, and all items were sold to the highest bidder. An important difference from eBay auctions is that bidders may submit either proxy bids or jump bids. With a proxy bid, the computer bids on behalf of the bidder incrementally up to his or her specified maximum willingness to pay. A jump bid specifies an amount to which the current high bid will jump. A bidder may also submit an incremental bid, in which the amount of the jump is equal to the minimum required bid increment. For estimation purposes, we include only proxy bids that are decisions by bidders, not computerized bids generated by the proxy bidding machine.4 The winning bidders paid for their items when they came to collect them at a local UPS store. The store does not sell any of the products sold in this study. In addition, all losing bidders in the voluntary-pay auctions were sent an email with a PayPal money request for the total of their nonwinning high bids for all auctions in which they participated (including a detailed calculation of the total). Importantly, the payments from losing bidders were collected separately from those of winning bidders. Thus, bidders could collect and pay for items they had won but could refuse to pay for the other amounts they had pledged as nonwinning bidders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In total, 108 unique bidders participated in Study 2. Eighty-nine bidders participated in the winner-pay format, and of these only ten bidders participated in both voluntary-pay and winner-pay auctions, indicating that very little overlap in auction format occurred between bidders. In contrast, in Study 3, 116 (96) bidders participated in the charity (noncharity) winner-pay format and 58 (43) bidders crossed formats. Thus, whereas in Study 2 nearly no crossing occurred, in Study 3 roughly half of the participants crossed between formats. This is appropriate because Study 2 was intended to compare behavior between formats, whereas Study 3 was designed to examine bidding strategy while accounting for the interaction between bidding and format choice.</p><a id="AN0128990188-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-14" title="Study 3: Simultaneous Auctions">Study 3: Simultaneous Auctions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 3 compared winner-pay and voluntary-pay in a simultaneous choice setting. Investigation into the simultaneous choice setting has a dual purpose. First, the literature on the all-pay format has been adamant that comparison between formats should permit endogenous entry—that is, bidders should be permitted to opt out of an auction format. Study of endogenous entry requires running auctions for both formats simultaneously. Second, by examining choices between auctions of different formats, we can infer preference over formats based on choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 3, setting A: Simultaneous charity auctions. All events consisted of auctions for books, DVDs, games, household items, computer and electronic products, and other items (Web Appendix B summarizes the products sold). In charity auctions, a written announcement appeared at the bottom of the auction description, just above the bid box, stating that the donation would be made to the local United Way campaign. In addition, the charity component and the auction format were described in an email to all registered members.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The event included 221 pairs of identical product auctions for a total of 442 auctions over a period of five days. A pair always had one voluntary-pay auction matched with one winner-pay auction. All auctions lasted one day, starting between 8:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. and ending the next day between 8:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. All other aspects of the auctions were identical, including the text (explanation and example) at the bottom of voluntary-pay auction descriptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All registered members received an email about the upcoming auctions two days before the start of the auctions. The email provided details about the duration, the types of products sold, and the different auction formats, including the charity component and the charity involved. Similar to Study 2, the payment-rule description (winner-pay or voluntary-pay) was prominently displayed on the front page of the website listing the auctions and just above the bid box in all individual auctions. All other aspects of the study, including the platform, the type of auctions (ascending-bid auctions), and processing of the winning bidders and all nonwinning bidders in the voluntary-pay auctions, were identical to those described for Study 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 3, setting B: Simultaneous noncharity auctions. We conducted a similar event to that of Setting A with 466 auctions (233 pairs of identical auctions), but without the charitable component. Again, auctions were run in simultaneous pairs, in which one auction is in a winner-pay format and the other a voluntary-pay format for the same product. The study was conducted one year after the charity event (the temporal distance minimizes order effects wherein experiences carry over to the next event), and over a six-day period (excluding the weekend). All other aspects were identical to those in setting A. The products sold were similar, although not identical, to those in the charity auctions (Web Appendix B summarizes the products sold).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The purpose of having two simultaneous auction formats was to allow bidders to choose between them, and from these choices to infer preference. In the noncharity condition, 44.79% (SE = 5.10%) of the bidders moved between formats. In the charity condition, the corresponding number is 54.72% (SE = 4.86%). Thus, a reasonable assumption is that most bidders consider both formats. We find that restricting the analysis to only those subjects observed to move between formats does not change the results. We provide the regression results for all subjects and results with the more restricted population in Web Appendix C.</p><a id="AN0128990188-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-15" title="Hypothesis Tests">Hypothesis Tests</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 2. Summary statistics related to auction outcome and bidder participation for Study 2 are summarized in Table 4. We report average winning bid, revenue, average number of bidders per auction, total number of unique bidders in the format, total number of switchers, revenue from winners, revenue from losers, revenue committed, revenue collected from losers, and total revenues. We report these findings for all three treatments of Study 2 with two-sample t-tests reported for comparison between pairs of formats for winning bid, revenue, bidders, and bids per bidder. To compare the revenues and other value-related variables, we normalized these variables by dividing them by the retail value. All tests are based on the normalized variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2a posits that bidders with lower propensity to pay are more likely to enter or bid in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions. This expectation is tested in Study 1 and Study 3, but not in Study 2, because bidders do not choose the format.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2b posits that voluntary-pay auctions have fewer entrants than winner-pay auctions. Table 4 shows that the number of bidders is smaller in the voluntary-pay format than in the winner-pay auction in the charity setting (t = 7.57, p &lt; .001). In the charity setting, the winner-pay auctions had 4.41 bidders versus 2.52 bidders in voluntary-pay auctions. This finding strongly supports H2b.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3a posits that more jump bidding will occur in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions. Recall our assertion that jump bids have an important deterrence potential in the voluntary-pay auction, owing to costly commitment, but do not have a similar potential in winner-pay auctions because those do not involve costly commitment. We find that of 614 final bids in the voluntary-pay auctions, 50.3% (SE = 3.7%) involved a jump bid. Of the 189 bids in the winner-pay auctions, 42.5% (SE = 2.0%) involved a jump bid. This difference is significant, based on a one-sided t-test (t = 1.88, p = .03), in support of H3a.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We find that 65.2% (SE = 1.9%) of final bids in the winner-pay auctions are late bids (during the last hour of the auction). In comparison, 63.5% (SE = 3.5%) of final bids in the voluntary-pay auctions are late bids. Thus, while last-hour bids are clearly the majority of final bids (and this is likely a strategic choice), we find no support for H3b in the non-simultaneous auctions. That is, we do not observe a higher incidence of late bids in the voluntary-pay auctions (t = .42, p = .68).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4 asserts that bidders with a higher propensity to pay in voluntary-pay auctions have a lower willingness to pay. As with H2a, propensity is a latent construct. It appears in our discussion of model estimation. However, we have supporting model-free evidence for H4, because maximum willingness to pay in charity auctions for noncompliant bidders is $10.35 versus $5.82 for compliant bidders (t = 2.92, p = .004).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5 asserts that bid pledges are lower in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions. Results from Table 4 show that the winning bid is $13.51 in charity winner-pay auctions and $6.76 in charity voluntary-pay auctions (p = .006). Thus, H5 is strongly supported.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H6 pertains to revenue comparisons. In Table 4, we see the auction outcomes for the two formats. The total combined pledged bids from the winning and losing bidders is higher in voluntary-pay ($1,352.40) than revenue in winner-pay ($1,013.06) auctions—a 33.5% improvement in revenue. The pairwise t-test is significant (t(74) = 2.34, p = .022). In the voluntary-pay charity auctions, $686.49 of $845.16, or 81.23% of the amount pledged by losing bidders, was collected, although this constituted merely 50.76% of the number of pledges by the losers.

In Study 3, the formats were running concurrently, and therefore, we cannot infer a manipulation effect. Nevertheless, we can look at t-test comparisons over bidders and auctions with the caveat that these are not manipulation checks but are rather comparisons for completion in light of the results of Study 2. We provide a fully specified econometric model subsequently. H2a posits that bidders with lower propensity to pay are more likely to enter voluntary-pay auctions than winner-pay auctions. This expectation involves a latent construct that requires a model (discussed subsequently). Nevertheless, we find that noncompliant bidders (nonpayers) placed more bids in voluntary-pay than in winner-pay charity auctions (2.70 vs. 2.37, respectively; t = 2.68, p = .01) and noncharity auctions (1.88 vs. 1.62, respectively; t = 2.83, p &lt; .01), in support of H2a.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In support of H2b, we find that the number of bidders is smaller in the voluntary-pay format than in the winner-pay format in both the charity (t = 7.03, p &lt; .001) and the noncharity (t = 12.95, p In opposition to H3a, we find that the rate of jump bids in voluntary-pay auctions is lower than in winner-pay auctions, in both charity (t = 4.40, p &lt; .001) and noncharity settings (t = 1.85, p = .065). Although we found support for H3a in Study 2, we do not find it in Study 3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To investigate the effectiveness of jump bidding as a deterrent to entry, we considered all large jump bids (10% of the item’s retail value). Results suggest that large, early jump bids increase the likelihood of winning in a voluntary-pay (vs. winner-pay) auction from 22.64% to 34.09% (t = 1.46, p = .07, one-tailed test) in charity auctions and from 13.64% to 38.10% in noncharity auctions (t = 2.52, p = .007, one-tailed test). This implies that early jump bids may be effective deterrents to entry in both charity and noncharity voluntary-pay auctions. H3b is concerned with late bidding. Because entry into voluntary-pay auctions is more costly, late bidding is predicted to be more prevalent in this auction format. We observe a significantly higher degree of late bidding in voluntary-pay auctions. Specifically, in the charity setting, looking at the last bid for each bidder, we observe 32.3% late bids. This result is in contrast to 15.8% late bids in the winner-pay auctions. This result is significant at p &lt; .01, providing support for H3b.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the noncharity setting, we observe 20.01% late bidding in the voluntary-pay and 14.41% late bidding in the winner-pay (t = 4.39, p &lt; .001) formats. This result provides strong support for H3b. Note that we did not find support for H3b in Study 2. However, in Study 3 bidders could choose which auction to bid in and, thus, select the winner-pay format. Bidders in Study 2 did not have this option, and more bidders entered early because bid levels were still relatively low.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consistent with H4, we find that bidders with a higher propensity to pay in voluntary-pay auctions have a lower willingness to pay. In particular, for noncompliant versus compliant bidders willingness to pay in charity auctions was $8.76 versus $5.20 (t = 2.09, p = .037) and in noncharity auctions was $14.22 versus $4.90 (t = 6.34, p &lt; .01). In support of H5, winning bids are significantly lower in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions. The winning bid in the charity winner-pay auction is $20.19 compared with $15.44 in the charity voluntary-pay auction (p &lt; .001), and the winning bid is $13.43 in noncharity winner-pay auctions compared with $7.50 in noncharity voluntary-pay auctions (p &lt; .001).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H6 predicts that revenue is higher in the voluntary-pay auction than in the winner-pay auction. The total combined pledged bids from the winning ($3,413.11) and losing ($4,427.95) bidders is $7,841.06 in voluntary-pay auctions, compared with $4,462.51 in winner-pay charity auctions; voluntary-pay auctions thus had 75.71% more bids pledged (t = 3.16, p = .002). In noncharity auctions, combined pledged bids from the winning ($1,698.58) and losing ($2,002.28) bidders is $3,704.46, versus $3,131.05 for winner-pay auctions (when normalized by retail price, revenue from the voluntary-pay format is slightly and insignificantly lower = .33, p = .745).5 Thus, we find higher revenues for the voluntary-pay format in the charity setting but not in the noncharity setting.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, not all pledges from losing bidders are collected. In the voluntary-pay charity auctions, 48.58% of the amount pledged by the losers was collected, whereas in the noncharity auctions, 44.00% was collected. Overall, the revenue collected for voluntary-pay auctions is 24.69% higher than the total revenue obtained in the winner-pay auctions for the charity setting ($5,564.24 vs. $4,462.51). In contrast, in the noncharity setting, voluntary-pay revenue is 17.61% lower than winner-pay revenue ($2,579.76 vs. $3,131.05). Thus, the collected revenues provide support for H6, because revenue in voluntary-pay charity auctions is higher than that in winner-pay charity auctions. We find the opposite in the noncharity setting because revenue is higher for winner-pay than for voluntary-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, results are highly consistent for Studies 2 and 3. The only difference is between jump bidding (H3a) and late bidding (H3b), because bidders have the option to bid in an alternative format in Study 3.</p><a id="AN0128990188-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-17" title="Model Estimation">Model Estimation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">So far, we have compared aggregate statistics between formats. We next examine whether individual bidding strategies are consistent with theory—in particular, whether they employ strategies that suggest they view bids in the voluntary-pay format as implying commitment. Our focus is on two potential strategies expected to be effective in the voluntary-pay auction: early jump bidding and late incremental bidding. We expect these strategies to be more prevalent in the voluntary-pay auction if bidders perceive their bids as involving commitment—something bidders in the winner-pay auction do not have. We found model-free evidence, reported in Table 4, to suggest that these strategies are employed differently in the voluntary-pay format, but ultimately the strategies are process-related constructs that are driven by process-related variables. Without a joint model of strategic bidding that controls for dynamically changing explanatory variables as well as the relationship between the decision variables, we cannot correctly identify the role of commitment in the voluntary-pay format.</p><a id="AN0128990188-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-18" title="A Four-Component Model">A Four-Component Model</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We employ a four-component model similar to that of Park and Bradlow (2005). The components capture the four strategic considerations of the bidder in the voluntary-pay format: auction choice, time to bid, jump bid, and propensity to pay. For the simultaneous design in Study 3, we estimate the full four-component model, while for the sequential design in Study 2 the model reduces to three components as auction choice is not present.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Endogeneity. When format choice is present (Study 3), jump bidding, time to bid, and propensity to pay link in the model to the propensity of auction choice. This type of endogeneity is a sample selection problem. In the Heckman approach (Heckman 1979), the inverse Mills ratio (IMR) —a transformation of the predicted selection propensity—serves as an explanatory variable in the outcome equation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The preference for the voluntary-pay format is estimated first, followed by the other three decisions. This sequence allows the propensity to choose the voluntary-pay format to be incorporated into the other decisions through the IMR. We allow for bidder-specific random effects correlated across decisions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Component 1: Auction choice. Each bidder chooses between two simultaneous auctions for identical items. Choice 1 in the pair is the voluntary-pay auction and choice 2 is the winner-pay auction. We use a latent utility model to capture auction preferences. This model implies that the choice of auction format is a choice between two utilities (Haruvy and Popkowski Leszczyc 2010). Given the binary choice, only the difference between the utilities is identified. The “difference” always refers to the voluntary-pay minus the winner-pay auctions. The utility difference between the voluntary-pay and winner-pay choices in auction pair I for bid k by bidder j is denoted DUijk and is defined as DUijk = b0, charityCharityi, k + b0, noncharity</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">LagPricei, k denotes the previous price. DLagPricei, k in the choice regression captures the difference in lag price on auction choice. DLagCumNoBiddersi, k captures the difference in competition between the auctions based on the cumulative number of bidders at the time of the previous bid. DLagJumpBidi, k is the amount of the previous bid increment, differenced between the two simultaneous auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Lag$Committedi, k is the amount a bidder has committed in the voluntary-pay auction for auction pair i. LagTimeElapsedi, k is the time elapsed in the auction in seconds since the time of the previous bid. DLagFrenzy is the difference between the extent of frenzy for the two auction types, defined as the lag cumulative total bids divided by elapsed time (Dholakia, Basuroy, and Soltysinski 2002). Finally, Categories 1–3 are three dummy variables that account for heterogeneity in the utility across different product categories, partly addressing self-selection related to product choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The implied probability of bidder j choosing the voluntary-pay auction over the winner-pay auction in bid k of auction pair I follows a logistic distribution as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We define the joint likelihood for bidder j’s format choices lchoicej as the product of all PrðChoiceijkÞ for bidder j over all auction pairs I in which bidder j participated, and bids k by bidder j.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Component 2: Time to bid. Let tijk and tijk-1 denote the timing of bid k and bid k - 1 by bidder j in auction pair i. We assume that the time between bids, Timeijk = tij k - tijk-1 of bidder j, who places the kth bid in auction pair i, follows a Weibull distribution, with a probability density function:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">LagPricei, k denotes the previous price and therefore captures the effect of price dynamic on the timing of bids. LagCumNoBiddersi, k and LagFrenzyi, k are both important variables that influence the timing of bids. LagTimeElapsedVoluntary-pay is the interaction between LagTimeElapsed and an indicator variable for the voluntary-pay format. The parameter h1j represents an individual-specific error term for bidder j, such that E(h1j) = 0 and variance s2 h1 &gt; 0. Finally, e1ijk represents the error term. We can then define the joint likelihood for bidder j’s timing choices lTime j as the product of all fðTimeijk; lij kÞ for bidder j over all auction pairs I inwhich bidder j participated, and all bids k by bidder j.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Component 3: Jump bid. We model jump bids by the amount the bidder bids over the previous highest bid minus the minimum bid increment. Jump bidding can serve as a deterrent in all-pay auctions but not in winner-pay auctions (Dekel, Jackson, andWolinsky 2007).Let I here denote auction I rather than auction pair. Let –i denote the other auction in the pair. LetVoluntary-Payi, k be an indicator function (dummy variable) that takes the value of 1 if auction I follows the voluntary-pay format, and 0 otherwise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After controlling for two separate intercepts for charity and noncharity, the next three explanatory variables in the equation denote the lag prices in the current auction, separately for charity and noncharity, and in the competing auction. LagCumNoBiddersi, k is critical in that it measures how responsive jump bids are to the presence of competitors. If jump bids are a deterrent, as we claim, we expect to see a positive and significant coefficient for this variable, indicating that bidders facing a competitive environment use jump bids to eliminate some of the competition. The variable Lag$Committedi, k is exactly the same as the variable by the same name in the “Component 1: Auction Choice” subsection. The next four terms pertain to the time elapsed in the auction and its interaction with auction format and whether it is a charity auction. Frenzyi, k is an important explanatory variable because it could be responsible for some jump-bidding activity. When auctions are slow (corresponding to low frenzy), bidders may incur significant opportunity or monitoring costs, and the jump bid size becomes a strategic decision, with bidders choosing larger jump bids (Kwasnica and Katok 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We add an IMR regressor to account for self-selection separately for charity and noncharity auctions.

We investigate a latent bidder’s propensity to pay, whereby higher propensity to pay means higher probability of observing payment on a losing bid. The propensities are unobserved, but we do observe who paid a losing bid. The propensity to pay clearly depends on what happened in the auction—both process and outcome.

The term e4ij represents the error term for propensity to pay and follows a normal distribution. Note the absence of subscript k, denoting the bid, on all terms except the last price. This absence occurs because the decision to pay is at the auction level and not at the bid level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Joint estimation. We estimate jump bid and bid timing jointly through a maximum likelihood involving jointly distributed errors for the two decisions with a bivariate normal distribution.

class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The positive significant coefficient for DLagCumNoBidders in noncharity auctions suggests herd behavior, consistent with competitive arousal. This is consistent with the positive signifi-cant coefficient for DLagFrenzy, suggesting that bidders are more likely to choose an auction in response to an increase in Lag-Frenzy. The positive significant coefficient for DLagJumpBid in both noncharity and charity auctions means that bidders are more likely to react to a large competing jump bid.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We find a positive significant coefficient for Lag$Committed in both charity and noncharity auctions. This means that a bidder finds the voluntary-pay format more attractive if (s)he has already made a commitment in that format (which needsto be paid whether (s)he wins or loses). The positive significant coefficient for Lag-TimeElapsed in charity and noncharity auctions means that bidders are more likely to bid as more time has elapsed in the auction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results for time-to-bid component. Time between consecutive bids is inversely related to the lambda parameter. Thus, a positive coefficient for any explanatory variable implies more concentrated bidding. We see a positive significant effect for LagPrice for noncharity auctions, suggesting that bids are more concentrated as price rises. This finding is consistent with our finding of strategic late bidding. We observe the opposite pattern—a negative coefficient on LagPrice—for charity auctions, wherein bidders with charitable motives have an incentive to bid earlier to push up the bid to help raise money for the organization (Haruvy and Popkowski Leszczyc 2009; Popkowski Leszczyc and Rothkopf 2010). The positive coefficient on cumulative bidders indicates that bids are more concentrated in auctions with more bidders. A positive coefficient for LagFrenzy suggests that an increase in LagFrenzy leads to more concentrated bidding. The positive coefficient for LagTimeElapsed is consistent with late bidding. The positive coefficient for LagTimeElapsedVoluntary-Pay indicates that bidders tend to wait to bid in voluntary-pay auctions. This result provides support for H5 for charity, where H5 predicts more late bidding in voluntary-pay auctions than in winner-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results for the jump bid component. The jump bid component of the model considers the magnitude of a jump bid. The positive coefficient for LagPrice_charity shows that bidders place a greater jump bid when the price is high, while the significant positive coefficient for LagCompetingPrice indicates that jump bids are influenced by the competing auction’s price. The positive coefficient may mean that a high price in the competing auction indicates that the price in the current auction is too low—thus the jump.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The positive significant coefficients on LagCumNoBidders for both charity and noncharity auctions indicates that bidders in both types of auctions are more likely to place greater jump bids when the auction is more competitive. The coefficient for Lag$Committed in the voluntary-pay auction is significant and positive in both charity and noncharity auctions, indicating more aggressive bidding by bidders who have already committed more money in an auction. Although the coefficient is significant, we observe half the magnitude of aggressive bidding in charity auctions, in which bidders may be less concerned with the amount they have committed because the money goes to charity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The negative effect for LagTimeElapsed in both charity and noncharity auctions suggests that the more time that has elapsed, the less likely bidders are to place higher jump bids in these auctions. However, the positive interaction between time elapsed and voluntary-pay auction format in both charity and noncharity auctions suggests that bidders are more likely to place a higher jump bid later on in a voluntary-pay auction, implying that bidders use jump bidding to try to win the auction. Finally, we observe differences in jump bidding across product categories, with less jump bidding for category 1 (DVDs, games, and books).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results for propensity-to-pay component. For the decision to pay, we find that losing bidders are more likely to pay in charity auctions, in more competitive auctions (frenzy), and when the final ending price is low. We further observe that bidders are more likely to pay for products in category 1 but less likely for products in category 2. Finally, IMR has a positive effect, suggesting that bidders who have a higher likelihood to bid in voluntary-pay auctions are more likely to pay. This result suggests a strong relationship between bidders who self-select into the voluntary-pay format and bidders’ propensity to pay for a losing bid.</p><a id="AN0128990188-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-21" title="Comparison of Results from Studies 2 and 3">Comparison of Results from Studies 2 and 3</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because of the endogenous choice of auction format in Study 3, we did not expect identical results between Studies 2 and 3. However, as we expected, we find that the ranking across conditions is consistent for winning bids, pledged revenues, collected revenues, compliance rate, number of bidders, and number of bids per bidder.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The rankings of collected revenues and compliance rates are comparable across the two studies. In Study 2, total revenue is $871.06 for noncharity winner-pay auctions, $1,013.06 for charity winner-pay auctions, and $1,193.73 for charity voluntary-pay auctions. All revenues are for the same set of 75 auctions run at different times, with zero overlap between formats. While the percentage difference between collected revenues in the winner-pay and voluntary-pay formats is somewhat smaller in Study 3 (17.83%) than in Study 2</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">(24.69%), both differences indicate that voluntary-pay auctions produce greater revenues than winner-pay. Although the percentage of collected revenues is slightly higher in the non-simultaneous setting than in the simultaneous setting—51% versus 49%—we consider these patterns remarkably robust.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Statistics for the paying and nonpaying losers in the voluntary-pay auctions show that paying losers bid less aggressively than nonpaying losers ($6.94 vs. $9.33; t = 2.92, p =.004), very similar to the results reported for Study 1 ($5.24 vs. $8.76; t = 2.09, p = .037). Finally, we look at the extent of jump bidding and the timing of bids. We find that the extent of jump bidding was similar in magnitude, although the rank order was not consistent across conditions for Study 2 versus Study 3 for winner-pay charity (46.62% vs. 47.51%), winner-pay non-charity (44.04% vs. 36.95%), and voluntary-pay charity</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">(56.91% vs. 41.87%). Furthermore, we find a greater percentage of early jump bids in voluntary-pay charity in Study 2 (5.79%) than in Study 3 (16.66%), suggesting that when a winner-pay format is also present, bidders avoid making a commitment in the voluntary-pay auction early on and tend to bid later on, when the price difference between the auctions becomes larger.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The extent of snipe bidding had the same rank order across conditions for Study 2 versus Study 3 for winner-pay charity (9.49% vs. 13.87%), winner-pay noncharity (13.99% vs. 15.09%), and voluntary-pay charity (22.73% vs. 41.24%). However, the magnitude of snipe bidding was significantly higher in Study 3 than in Study 2 for the voluntary-pay auction. This result is consistent with a lower number of early jump bids in Study 3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Study 2 we estimate a three-component model including the decisions on time to bid, jump bid, and propensity to pay. The explanatory variables are the same as for Study 3. However, any explanatory variables pertaining to the competing auction (e.g., LagCompetingPrice) are not applicable, nor are any variables pertaining to the missing treatment of voluntary-pay noncharity (e.g., Lag$Committed_noncharity; LagTimeElapsedVoluntary-Pay_noncharity). Furthermore, the main treatment intercepts (charity, noncharity) cannot be identified separately from voluntary-pay, because noncharity is present only for winner-pay. Estimation results appear in Web Appendix D.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 5’s comparison of the results from the sequential setting of Study 2 with those from the simultaneous setting of Study 3 reveals three major differences:</p><ol><li><span class="medium-normal"> In the time-to-bid component, all signs and significance levels are preserved except for the reaction to past prices, which we term “strategic late bidding.” Specifically, in Study 3, we find that lag price in the noncharity setting has a significant positive effect—meaning late concentrated bidding in response to high prices. In the charity setting in Study 3, we find the opposite pattern. In Study 2, in contrast, we found no significant effect of past prices on the timing of bids in either the charity or noncharity setting, possibly owing to the absence of choice between formats reducing the benefit of strategic late bidding.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> In Study 2, in the jump-bid component, only the time variables are significant. This finding is different from Study 3, in which bidders are less likely to place higher jump bids late in voluntary-pay auctions, probably because bidders have no alternative outlet in which to bid.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> In the propensity-to-pay component, charity is not included in the sequential model (it is confounded with the intercept since the voluntary-pay was run only in a charity setting). In contrast to Study 3, bidders are no more likely to pay when the ending price is low or when auctions are more competitive.</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, the main insight from the three-component model is that the relationships indicated in Study 3 are largely preserved. The same was the case for the hypotheses discussed previously. The purpose of the four-component model was to extract revealed preferences from the observed format choices, which Study 2 cannot do. We controlled for self-selection owing to auction format, but self-selection on product choice in Study 3 may persist. That is, people may have self-selected themselves into Study 3 on the basis of product preferences. However, the three-component exercise served as a robustness check and ensured that there would be no reversed patterns or exploding magnitudes in one study versus the other. We find that the patterns are robust, suggesting that self-selection bias owing to auction format is not a concern.</p><a id="AN0128990188-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-22" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0128990188-23"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-23" title="Main Contribution">Main Contribution</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We studied compliance behavior and revenue implications in winner-pay and voluntary-pay auctions in charity and noncharity settings. Study 1 was an experiment that tested different social appeals (using internal and external pressure) for compliance. We find that although we can effectively apply social pressure to compel bidders to pay, the unintended—yet intuitive—consequences of that action may be reduced entry and lower bids.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we conduct two field studies to study voluntary-pay auctions and payment compliance in a real-world setting. In particular, we focused on revenue implications for voluntary-pay versus winner-pay auctions in charity and noncharity settings as well as bidding strategies such as jump bidding and strategic late bidding.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, results showed that in the charity setting, in which social responsibility was high, the voluntary-pay auction resulted in higher collected revenues for the seller even though commitments were not binding. In the noncharity setting, in which social responsibility was lower, we found higher revenues for winner-pay auctions. The difference in the relative success of voluntary-pay auctions between charity and non-charity settings can be attributed to three factors. First, bidders are more likely to participate in charity voluntary-pay auctions than in noncharity voluntary-pay auctions. Second, bidders are willing to bid higher in charity settings than noncharity settings. Third, higher revenues can be collected from losing bidders in charity settings.</p><a id="AN0128990188-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-24" title="Broader Conceptual and Theoretical Insights">Broader Conceptual and Theoretical Insights</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While payment noncompliance in auctions is occasionally addressed in the literature (e.g., Bruce, Haruvy, and Rao 2004), for the most part it is ignored as nonconsequential. In this work, we provide a compelling demonstration that noncompliance is highly consequential. Not only does compliance vary between settings, but its dependence on the setting changes the profitability of possible formats relative to one another. Non-compliant bidders self-select into formats in which they can take advantage of the trust of the format to extract higher surplus. We found important differences in bidding behavior between losers who reneged on their commitment versus those who did not. In particular, nonpaying losers tended to bid more aggressively, placing more and higher bids. Although these bidders reneged, discouraging them may be unwise, as they play an important role in increasing prices and revenues in voluntary-pay auctions. Alternatively, we find that different appeals may be effective to increase compliance. In particular, external social pressure in the form of public acknowledgment of payments results in a significantly higher likelihood of payment than internal social pressure and improves format choice to favor voluntary-pay auctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our research has broad and important implications for bidding strategies. We focused on two strategies in voluntary-pay auctions: early jump bidding and late incremental bidding. We expected these strategies to be more effective in voluntary-pay auctions because bidders face costly commitments—something bidders in winner-pay auctions do not have. Late bidding is helpful because it allows bidders to defer commitment and thus lower their risk. Accordingly, when bidders have a choice between formats, we observed more late bidding in voluntary-pay auctions (for both charity and noncharity settings).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The interaction between time to bid and jump bidding is a key strategic consideration for bidders (Haruvy, Popkowski Leszczyc, and Ma 2014; Kwasnica and Katok 2007) and is of paramount importance. Bidders with a high cost of time will place higher jump bids (Kwasnica and Katok 2007). Thus, jump bidding coincides with longer bidding intervals. Our empirical demonstration is coupled with a methodological implementation that gives researchers and practitioners a simple way to implement this insight in an estimation framework that can demonstrably apply in a field setting.</p><a id="AN0128990188-25"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-25" title="Main Managerial Implications">Main Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article has important implications for marketing managers. Our findings augment the growing stream of empirical auction studies and corporate social responsibility in marketing and contribute behavioral insights.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Improving fundraising capabilities. Our findings add to the increased focus on fundraising in the corporate social responsibility literature. We find that combining an auction with a donation to charity may result in increased revenues—a finding with wide-reaching implications. While all-pay auctions have long been advocated as advantageous in raising funds for social causes, in practice the feasibility of collecting on such auction formats has hindered their wide adoption. We showed that perfect compliance is not essential, and a similar format—the voluntary-pay auction—is also advantageous in charitable settings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The importance of compliance incentives for format selection. The finding that voluntary-pay auctions substantially increase collected revenue in charity settings while resulting in lower collected revenue in noncharity settings suggests that in the absence of strong contractual enforcement mechanisms, voluntary-pay auctions tend to be better suited to settings with moderate to high social responsibility. When selecting an auction format, or any two possible pricing formats, managers should ensure that they are accounting for differential compliance rates between the auction formats they are considering. If the two formats are running concurrently, managers should consider whether buyers with different levels of compliance propensity might self-select among formats in a manner that distorts incentives.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Compliance by losing bidders in voluntary-pay auctions. While managers may apply social pressure to comply people to pay, they need to take care that this will not result in reduced entry and more cautious bidding. To increase compliance, they may want to use positive external pressure (e.g., by publicly posting losing bidders who paid). Finally, while it may be possible to identified and screened out low-compliance bidders, doing so is not clearly advantageous, because noncompliant bidders bid up prices.</p><a id="AN0128990188-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-26" title="Limitations and Directions for Future Research">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the long run, bidders might sort themselves into charity or noncharity, winner-pay, or voluntary-pay auctions according to preferences and expected payoffs. Clearly, our results would be weaker if noncompliant bidders entered en masse into the voluntary-pay charity auction. Although this is not the case with the population we study, it is an important boundary condition. Two factors should be considered: the proportion of compliant bidders that would enter the voluntary-pay auction (charity or otherwise) and the bidding aggression of noncompliant bidders. Any drop in the proportion of compliant bidders would have to be offset by an increase in bidding aggressiveness of non-compliant bidders to keep voluntary-pay auctions superior. To characterize this frontier, a controlled study would need to systematically vary the proportion of compliant and non-compliant bidders.</p><a id="AN0128990188-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990188-27" title="APPENDIX A">APPENDIX A</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Experimental Conditions for Different Compliance Appeals</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">You are facing two possible auction formats:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Voluntary-pay auction: This is a special format where all bidders—including losing bidders—receive a bill for the amount of their highest bid (e.g., if you place several bids and your highest bid is $150, then whether you win or lose you will receive a bill for $150).

The authors begin with a description of the TIU approach and compare it with other inductive and deductive research approaches. The benefits of engaging in TIU-based research are discussed, including the development of novel organic marketing theories and the opportunity to cocreate relevant marketing knowledge with practitioners. Next, they review criteria for selecting research questions that are particularly well-suited for examination with TIU-based research. This is followed by detailed suggestions for TIU research: focusing on developing new constructs, theoretical propositions (involving antecedents, moderators, and consequences), and arguments for justifying theoretical propositions. A discussion of TIU tradecraft skills, validity checks, and limitations follows. The authors close with a discussion of future theory-building opportunities using the TIU approach.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: building theory; grounded theory; theories-in-use; theory construction; theory development</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The marketing discipline is at a crossroads ([28]; [47]). Marketing scholars can continue on the well-worn road of largely testing or extending theories by borrowing from allied disciplines, or we can challenge ourselves to make a significant difference in the lives of managers, public policy officials, and/or consumers. Our point of view is that this road less traveled necessitates deeply and richly exploring marketing topics from the perspectives of individuals (i.e., consumers, managers, and/or public policy officials) who are closest to the problem. This means leaving the comfortable confines of our faculty offices to explore, identify, and define new marketing concepts in their natural habitat.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, as we leave our offices to engage with individuals closest to the problem, we are not simply advocating recording, summarizing, and building rich descriptive narratives. While these narratives are valuable in their own right, we are advocating something more. Namely, we advocate constructing new-to-the-world marketing theories. It is widely acknowledged that theories launch the fundamental knowledge of a discipline ([49]) and are the building blocks for the maturation of a discipline. Articles whose primary contribution is based on proposing theories are generally viewed favorably ([60]). In fact, theoretical advances are critical to the development of marketing as a discipline ([30]). Not surprisingly, editors welcome new theories that are particular to the marketing discipline (see [33]). Against this background, our objective is to discuss an approach that is ideally suited to the development of theories in marketing: the "theories-in-use" (TIU) approach.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A TIU is a person's mental model of how things work in a particular context ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref7" title="2">2</a>]). As part of daily life, all individuals employ mental models ([66]). All stakeholders in marketing—among them managers, customers, employees, and public policy makers—have mental models that can be elicited by TIU research to surface interesting, novel theories and concepts that can advance both marketing practice and scholarship. Specifically, we argue that TIU is a natural approach for creating theories that are specific to marketing-related issues—what have been referred to as organic ([26]) or home-grown ([49]) theories. Organic marketing theories involve central constructs that are uniquely or primarily grounded in the marketing context rather than borrowed from other disciplines such as economics or psychology. In this regard, TIU has served as an approach for organic contributions to the marketing discipline by bringing to fore concepts such as service quality, market orientation, experiential consumption, customer solutions, and hybrid offerings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More specifically, a TIU approach can help address three fundamental problems in our discipline. First, when we borrow from other fields, our own stakeholders' problems do not guide our research. Rather than allowing our own stakeholders' problems to guide us, we force-fit a theory or framework on which to base our research. The result is that we are not building a discipline-based body of knowledge. This borrowing approach is certainly one reason that marketing scholarship is losing touch with the practice of marketing ([28]; [47]). Second, borrowing constrains us because we restrict ourselves to what is already known, thereby hampering our search for novel and interesting phenomena. Third, when using abstract theoretical constructs from other fields, we lessen our ability to communicate with our stakeholders in a vocabulary they understand. It is much easier to advance the practice of marketing if one speaks the same language as practitioners than it is to introduce an entirely new glossary of terms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Paradoxically, only a (relatively) small number of TIU articles have been published to date. This is surprising because TIU articles not only are published in our most respected journals but have won major awards (e.g., Shelby D. Hunt/Harold H. Maynard Award, Sheth Foundation/ <em>Journal of Marketing</em> Award), have established subfields of study within the discipline (e.g., service quality, market orientation), and have been a key catalyst for endowed chair appointments at some of the best business schools. As Table 1 notes, three of the top ten articles in <em>Journal of Marketing</em> are TIU articles. Despite this clear discipline and career impact, few researchers pursue TIU research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1.

To achieve this objective, we organize this article as follows. We begin with a definition of the TIU approach. In this section, we compare and contrast TIU with other grounded theory methods and deductive research methods for knowledge development. Following this, we discuss key benefits of engaging in TIU-based research. With this foundation in mind, we turn to the practice of TIU research in the field. We divide this practice discussion into two sections: one that overviews the "basics" of TIU research and one that provides insight on the advanced tradecraft of the practice. As with any method, one must be able to judge "good and bad" practice; thus, we then turn to an assessment of rigor in TIU. This is followed by a discussion of the limitations of the approach. We conclude with suggestions for future research.</p><a id="AN0140321873-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-2" title="Theory Construction and TIU">Theory Construction and TIU</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[66] note that individuals' TIU may be envisioned as a set of "if-then" relationships among actions and outcomes. For example, an advertising manager's TIU may include the proposition that if she associates her brand with an important social cause, then millennial consumers may be more likely to buy her brand. People's TIU may also include complex if-then relationships. For example, a marketer's TIU may include the idea that a firm's customer-centricity improves its profitability, but an increase in customer centricity beyond a certain level adversely affects firm profitability because it is too costly. That is, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between customer centricity and firm profitability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At its core, the theory construction process involves developing novel if-then propositions. In contrast, the theory-testing process involves empirically assessing the validity of previously developed propositions. While the two processes and their aims are distinct, they potentially can be interrelated. For instance, a theory-testing effort may reveal unexpected findings, which may lead to the construction of new theory to account for the findings.

They contrasted the concept with "espoused theories" that refer to the mental models individuals claim or purport to have. While overlap may exist between individuals' TIU and their espoused theories, often these two types of theory differ. For instance, individuals may be unable to articulate parts of their TIU that are tacit. More often still, defensive reasoning mindsets develop that discourage sharing revealing insights ([<a id="bib1up

The approach involves soliciting from study participants—the theory holders—the ideas they feel are important and how they are linked to one another. The emerging set of interrelated constructs, regardless of how complete or incomplete they may be as theories, become a researcher's starting point for harvesting constructs, propositions, and arguments. Researchers, however, are not simply passive recorders of participants' thinking. They use their viewing lenses to elicit, evaluate, abstract and extend what they "hear" from theory holders included in the study ([63]). The TIU approach relies on one-on-one participant conversations and elicits theories from a relatively small number of participants (often 15–25).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The TIU approach is also unique in that it is a partnership that allows for the cocreation of a theory. Participants are treated as active partners in the theory development process, allowing for the presence of implicit and explicit causal thinking among them about the ideas they consider important. Researchers may then draw on other sources of insight they have acquired about the topic to modify the ultimate constructs' abstraction levels and causal connections among them to develop theoretical propositions. Said differently, a TIU approach assumes that the theory holders being interviewed have theories that researchers can uncover and extend using other sources of insight. This is what makes a TIU approach a partnership. It is grounded in two different mindsets—that of the researcher and the interviewees—<em>each focused on theory</em>.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A TIU approach becomes an even stronger partnership when researchers convene representative stakeholders including some original study participants to critique and discuss the researcher's tentative formal theory. In this way, two mindsets, the researcher's and the theory holders', are formally brought to bear on the topic. A new and better theory is likely to be created. This is less likely or even unlikely to occur with other approaches falling under the rubric of grounded theory construction.</p><a id="AN0140321873-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-4" title="TIU Versus Other Approaches to Theory Construction">TIU Versus Other Approaches to Theory Construction</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In general, the theory construction process is inductive in nature.

For instance, in theoretical modeling, researchers set up models (settings/scenarios) with different characteristics and derive implications of the models for the behaviors of participants in the model (e.g., firms, salespeople, consumers). These behaviors are then linked to the (differing) characteristics of the different models (generally across articles) to construct new theory ([34]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In many instances, researchers review the literature, see gaps or conflicts, and propose new theory, often by introducing a moderator construct or a new explanation stimulated by their own experiences or derived from extant research. This process can be inductive or deductive in nature. For instance, when researchers combine knowledge about a phenomenon in the literature with their personal experiences related to the phenomenon to develop new theory, it is more akin to an inductive process. In contrast, when researchers put two or more findings/assertions in the literature together to derive a new theory, the process is deductive in nature.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 2 shows prominent inductive and deductive approaches for theory construction and summarizes key differences among them with respect to six facets: purpose, researcher mindset, research process, data collection method, sample selection, and sample size/depth. As the table shows, a major difference between the inductive and deductive approaches is that whereas inductive approaches start with data pertaining to a phenomenon of interest, deductive approaches start with models (settings/scenarios) or theories and work through their implications. A related difference is that whereas a researcher's mindset in inductive approaches is one of exploration and hunting (seeking and processing data in quest of theoretical insights) for constructs and theories inherent but hidden or as yet unarticulated in data, the researcher's mindset in deductive approaches is one of setting up models that are sufficiently realistic yet tractable.</p><a id="AN0140321873-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-5" title="Why Use a TIU Approach?">Why Use a TIU Approach?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As with any research approach, TIU suits certain research questions better than others.

Missing from the discussion was a customer-centric perspective on solution offerings. Using a TIU approach, [56] provided a view of solutions from the customers' perspective, which extended the supplier view of solutions. Similarly, when conflicting theoretical perspectives exist on a novel construct, a TIU approach can help researchers better understand when and why one theoretical perspective may be preferable to the other. Relatedly, the TIU approach can bring precision and clarity when there is ambiguity surrounding constructs and/or nomological net of relationships among constructs.

A follow-up study empirically examined these variables to identify the most important in each of the four gaps and the relative importance of the four gaps themselves (Parasuraman, Berry and Zeithaml 1991a).

In general, a typical research project requires 15–25 participants selected in successive phases. The knowledge/experience required of the participants in each phase becomes clearer as the research progresses and theoretical ideas come into sharper focus. Importantly, the researcher should have a very strong interest in the research questions/issues and should have good general knowledge related to them. This enables the researcher to listen carefully to participants, ask probing questions, challenge participants when appropriate, and engage with participants in a flexible way—adapting the questions asked to the idiosyncratic knowledge of individual participants and to the learnings from prior participants in the TIU study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1 provides an overview of the TIU research process.

This may take several iterations and feedback loops based on participant conversations (see right-hand side of Figure 1). If the construct is well defined, the research moves to the stage of developing propositions and their associated arguments. The propositions can include antecedents, consequences, mediators, and or moderators. After a few conversations, the researcher begins to formulate tentative propositions that may be assessed on basic screening criteria related to the plausibility and strength of reasoning. After multiple propositions are developed, they must also pass higher-order assessments that relate to the overall contribution of the set of propositions (see Figure 1). These pertain to whether the collective set of ideas adds to the existing literature.

Some of the responses were along the following lines: "It's all about customer need satisfaction,"[10] "You have to know what competition you are up against," "It means your research and development (R&amp;D) is in touch with what's going on in the market," and so on. The researchers formed a tentative idea of the construct's domain from these responses. For example, these responses suggested that the construct was about delivering customer satisfaction in the face of competition, and that R&amp;D is somehow involved in the process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A follow-up probe, "Tell me a little about your activities that reflect a market orientation," elicited numerous responses. They included "We keep our eyes on the customer and competitors," "We put the customer at the center of everything we do," "We make sure people in one function know what people in other functions are doing," "We reward people for providing exceptional service," and so on. These comments suggest that the construct involves knowing customers and competitors, everyone in the company focusing on customers, and each function knowing what the other functions are doing. Note that the last quote is indeterminate as to whether it belongs to the construct's domain or is an antecedent of the (yet to be precisely defined) construct. Follow-up probes might ask, "Can you tell me how one function finds out what the others are doing?" and "What exactly do you do to know how the consumer environment is changing?" to clarify these questions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After a few of these conversations, the researcher begins to identify commonalities across the participant observations and to abstract them to a higher level. For example, while some participants indicated that they sent out customer surveys, others relied on syndicated data. Yet others visited customers personally. However, the commonality here is that of the generation of customer intelligence through different methods. This led to the development of the idea that market orientation involves, in part, intelligence generation about customers. Subsequent conversations and ongoing reflections led to the eventual definition of market orientation as organization-wide generation, dissemination, and responsiveness to market intelligence.</p><a id="AN0140321873-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-12" title="Proposition development">Proposition development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A researcher's focus here is the development of if-then propositions that aim to identify a phenomenon's antecedents, consequences, mediators, and/or moderators of the phenomenon's effects. At one level, this is relatively straightforward—the researcher asks participants questions such as "Can you give me examples of actions you took to increase X (the phenomenon)?," "In your opinion, what happens when X increases?," "Can you recall instances in which X didn't lead to that?," and "What accounts for the unexpected results?" However, participants frequently identify antecedents that reflect the core construct itself or are too proximal to the core construct to be of theoretical interest. For example, when asked to indicate why some organizations are not very market oriented, one participant said, "It's because they fail to give customers what they want." Note that this is a part of the market orientation construct, not its antecedent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The types of questions that the researcher asks should be based on the research goal (see Table 5). For example, if the research goal is to link construct X to novel outcomes, the researcher may ask, "What are the benefits of doing X?," "Were there any surprises or unexpected outcomes of doing X?," or "Did increasing the level of X lead to outcomes that contradict conventional wisdom about X?"</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As the conversations progress, the researcher forms a relatively clear (albeit tentative) proposition that X leads to Y. At this point, the researcher can assess the proposition by asking questions directly related to the proposition. For example, the researcher may say, "My last interviewee believes that X leads to Y. What is your view?" or "My last interviewee found that X leads to Y. What is your reaction?" This is particularly useful for propositions that include abstract constructs developed by the researcher. If the level of abstraction is too high, subsequent participants are likely to indicate that the proposition(s) is questionable.</p><a id="AN0140321873-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-13" title="Argument development">Argument development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to developing if-then and "if-then-except-when" theoretical propositions, a researcher must also provide plausible arguments or justifications for the propositions. Argument development involves probing participants for the reasons they hold their if-then beliefs. Thus, a researcher may ask participants, "Why do you believe X leads to Y?" or "Why do you expect M to strengthen the effect of X on Y?" Developing an argument may also involve listening to the reasons offered by participants and identifying one or more mediators of the effect of X on Y. As in the case of developing theoretical propositions, the challenges here pertain to appropriate level of abstraction as well as to maintaining consistency with the evolving definitions of the core construct and the antecedent, consequence, or moderator variables involved.</p><a id="AN0140321873-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-14" title="Advanced Guidelines">Advanced Guidelines</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0140321873-15"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-15" title="Construct development">Construct development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A key aspect of theory construction using a TIU approach is the process of abstraction from the raw data surfaced in the course of participant conversations. Abstraction involves considering two or more elements (e.g., words, phrases, ideas in one or more sentences) in raw data (e.g., transcriptions of participant conversations), pooling the elements into a higher-order category or construct, and giving it a label (i.e., name/term). Such a construct is of a higher order (i.e., is more abstract) than the elements in the sense that it captures the essential information in the two or more elements but excludes some of their details.

We discuss three approaches. In the first approach, a researcher examines the data within and across participant conversations and notices that they contain several elements that have different meanings but all seem to be subsets of one of the elements in the data. In this case, the latter element is of a high-order (i.e., is more abstract), and the researcher may consider it a candidate construct for his or her theory. The abstraction process here is one of identifying elements that are all a part of a broader, more abstract element and treating all as the latter element for the purpose of theory construction. Importantly, this calls for the researcher to actively seek out such interrelationships among the elements to identify them. For example, participants may provide the following statements to a researcher to indicate that their respective firms are market oriented: "We <em>survey</em> customers to find out their needs and wants," "Our company does a lot of <em>market research</em> every quarter," "Our salespeople <em>ask customers</em> how we can serve them better," and "We <em>generate intelligence</em> about our markets." In this case, the process of abstraction involves observing that the italicized elements in the first three statements are subsets of the italicized element in the fourth statement and thus suggests using the construct of "market intelligence generation" in subsequent theory construction efforts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the second approach, a researcher examines the data within and across participants and notices that they contain elements that likely co-occur (or covary). That is, when one element is present (or is at a high level), another element is also likely to be present (or at a high level). The researcher pools these elements into a higher-order category or construct and, if needed, gives it a label/name. For example, one or more participants may describe customer reactions to exceptional service in restaurants as follows: "They <em>feel valued</em> as customers," "Their <em>eyes come alive</em>," "They <em>smile, and thank</em> the waitpersons," and "They <em>leave big tips</em>." Each of the italicized elements likely occurs when the other elements also occur. As such, the researcher may pool them into a higher-order category or construct of customer satisfaction and use it for subsequent theory construction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the third approach, the researcher examines the data within and across participants and notices that they contain elements (e.g., words, phrases) that are neither subsets of one of the elements (approach 1) nor do they necessarily co-occur or covary (approach 2). Rather, they appear to be different facets/dimensions/aspects of a broader concept or idea. The researcher pools these elements into the higher-order category or construct and, if needed, gives it a label/name. For example, participants may describe outcomes of investing in market research as "Market research helps us get a bigger <em>piece of the market</em>," "It brings in more <em>revenue</em>," and "It costs money, but in the end, we <em>save money</em> because we don't try to be all things to all customers." The italicized elements are not subsets of one of them and often do not covary, but each is an indicator of the broader concept of how well a firm is performing. As such, the researcher may pool them into a higher-order category or construct of firm performance for use in subsequent theory construction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, as a construct's meaning begins to form, a researcher must take care that the construct's domain is not too narrow or too broad. If it is too narrow, it is too specific and limits the generalizability of the theory. If it is too broad, its components may not all relate to other constructs (potential antecedents or consequences) in a similar manner. This becomes clearer as the construct's antecedents and consequences emerge in the course of participant conversations. Importantly, as a construct's meaning begins to emerge, the researcher must ascertain whether it is truly capturing a distinct phenomenon, one not reflected by other known constructs (especially those already discussed in the literature). For example, when asked whether they thought market orientation and customer orientation were the same thing or different, most participants pointed out that market orientation was a broader construct in that it focused on customers and other influences on them, whereas customer orientation focused exclusively on customers. Upon reflection, it became clear that the two would have somewhat different antecedents (e.g., company systems that base rewards on customer satisfaction vs. those that base them on broader metrics such as market share and profitability).</p><a id="AN0140321873-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-16" title="Proposition development">Proposition development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After developing constructs, a researcher links them to develop tentative theoretical propositions, stimulated by participants' TIU elicited in course of participant conversations.

There are two main challenges in developing propositions that identify antecedent, consequence, mediator, and moderator variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, when the core construct/phenomenon is yet to be defined precisely, the emerging antecedents, consequences, mediators and moderators need to be identified and defined in conjunction with the core construct in a way that the resulting propositions make sense. For example, when a participant in the market orientation research was asked, "Why do some firms fail to give customers what they want?," he indicated, "Well, they are afraid of changing what they have done for many years. They feel safe doing the tried and tested." A further "why" probe led to "Because they are afraid they will be pulled up by the management if they do something different and it bombs." A few more probes later led to the more interesting revelation that an organization's employees may fail to provide customers the offerings they need because of the fear of being punished by their managers who themselves are concerned about being punished by a risk-averse top management. This led to the identification of "top management risk aversion" as an antecedent of market orientation. Note that "top management risk aversion" is not a part of the core construct and is a relatively abstract, novel construct, and the proposition makes sense if market orientation is defined in part as responding to customers' changing needs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, the propositions developed should ideally be novel (i.e., not documented in the literature) and interesting (i.e., not obvious but useful). Such propositions often challenge conventional wisdom, identify conditions in which extant theory does not hold, or develop interesting nuances that lead to "aha!" moments for the readers. Frequently, however, participants offer input with little insight. For example, when asked why some firms are more market oriented than others, several participants indicated, "Firms that are market oriented are that way because they care," and "It takes hard work to be market oriented." These and many other ideas that emerged in the course of the conversations were either obvious or previously documented and, therefore, not pursued further. It is important for the researcher to continually ensure that the propositions (s)he is generating and retaining for further consideration are new to the literature, interesting, plausible, and of importance to some set of stakeholders.[12]</p><a id="AN0140321873-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-17" title="Argument development">Argument development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A straightforward way for a researcher to develop arguments to support a theoretical proposition is to ask participants why they believe (and perhaps why they do not believe) in a proposition. It is very important, however, for a researcher to critically evaluate the soundness of the reasoning before accepting it as plausible. The researcher may also develop theoretical propositions and arguments by connecting disparate ideas obtained from two or more participants. For example, one participant may note that doing A leads to Y, and another participant may suggest that doing X leads to A; putting these two assertions together would suggest the testable proposition that doing X leads to Y, the argument being that X leads to A, which in turn leads to Y.</p><a id="AN0140321873-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-18" title="Pulling it all together">Pulling it all together</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Frequently, a researcher's goal is to construct a set of coherent theoretical propositions that collectively represent a substantial contribution to the literature. After generating a reasonably large number of theoretical propositions, a researcher should take stock of them with a view to selecting the ones that have one or a few common themes such that the selected set can be formalized in a parsimonious way. The researcher may group the constructs involved across propositions into broader categories, or identify one or a few common high-level arguments across propositions.

The tentative theory guides the researcher's focus in collecting data from subsequent participants. These data frequently augment the tentative theory and/or suggest its modification (e.g., revising constructs, changing their abstraction levels, adding propositions, developing new arguments). The resulting theory, in turn, guides subsequent data collection, and so on, until a researcher is satisfied with the theory.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For example, say that a researcher is interested in constructing a theory of postrecession performance of firms. Drawing on data collected from the first few participants, the researcher constructs a tentative theory that a firm that increases its R&amp;D spending during a recession enjoys higher market share after the recession. After a few more conversations, the researcher constructs another tentative theory that a firm that invests in operations to make them more efficient during a recession increases its profitability after the recession because it redirects slack resources during the recession to reducing ongoing operations costs. At this point, the researcher considers the elements "R&amp;D spending" and "investments in operations" and abstracts them to a broader construct of capability building. Similarly, the researcher abstracts "market share" and "profitability" to a broader construct of firm performance. Using these constructs, the researcher constructs the proposition "The greater a firm's capability building during a recession, the greater the firm performance postrecession."</p><a id="AN0140321873-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-21" title="Active Listening">Active Listening</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A researcher is not simply a passive ear. The maxim that data do not say anything—only managers or researchers do—applies to TIU research as much as it does to other methods ([64]). Theories-in-use approaches provide a special opportunity for researchers to exercise disciplined imagination and add unique value to an investigation. This occurs, for instance, when researchers listen carefully for what a participant is <em>not</em> saying (i.e., what potentially important ideas seem to be missing or understated by interviewees). For example, in an insight development project, managers had little to say about the important constraints placed on insight development by long-standing company policies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, a researcher may develop a theoretical proposition that was not directly stated or derivable from participant data but still grounded in them. For instance, one participant may identify P as a new antecedent of a phenomenon, and another participant may identify M as a moderator of the effect of a different antecedent R. The two sets of ideas may lead the researcher to examine whether M may moderate the influence of P (in addition to that of R). A researcher also has an important role in adding value by explaining why certain findings are surprising, counterintuitive, or contrary to received wisdom on the topic.</p><a id="AN0140321873-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-22" title="Belief Suspension">Belief Suspension</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When engaging with a participant, it is key for researchers to temporarily suspend their prior beliefs and tentative ideas developed in the course of previous participant conversations. This is not easy, but it is important to listen with an open mind, absorb the participant's ideas, and probe deeper into those that have the potential for generating new insights. Researchers can feign ignorance and ask a number of "why" questions even if they believe they know the answer: "Why do you say that?," "Why does it affect X?," "Why would doing X not be helpful in circumstance M?" As these questions continue, they can lead to interesting new insights.</p><a id="AN0140321873-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-23" title="Depth over Breadth">Depth over Breadth</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As may be evident from the previous examples, participant conversations elicit considerable commentary. When listening to a participant's responses, the researcher should try to identify and define the abstract construct that reflects the detailed description provided by the participant. To the extent the researcher is successful in doing this, the theory construction task following the participant conversations becomes easier because a theory essentially is a set of interrelated constructs.

For example, a context may be business-to-business firms and a researcher may be exploring constructs X, Y, and Z. The business-to-business context, however, also has other constructs associated with it (e.g., direct sales force vs. channel partners, client concentration).

Providing direct quotes from one or two of them is a convincing way to accomplish this. These quotes provide a verbal lexicon and allow the reader the opportunity to develop an alternative formulation. However, as participants in a conversational mode frequently allude to multiple ideas in a single sentence or two, the researcher must portray quotes that clearly and unambiguously make the intended point.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another emergent, value-added quality that can strengthen a paper is an answer to the question, "So what?" This question can be answered from both a researcher and marketing stakeholder standpoint. For example, the final construct network or mental model that represents consensus thinking among participants can be used as a playground for theory construction. The researcher may offer an additional map containing new constructs and their proposed relationships along with those already in the map. The changes in the map (i.e., the new constructs and their connections with others previously identified in the interviews) would represent the researcher's unique reflections about the data. This new bundle of related, testable propositions is a new theory that could guide future research and thinking.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The consensus map may also be a basis for helping marketing stakeholders think through its relevance to their positions. The researcher can offer "map management" suggestions to stakeholders. For instance, they might be encouraged to ask, "Which constructs should be emphasized or deemphasized in their situation? How might particular connections between constructs be weakened or strengthened? What new constructs may be added to the original consensus map network?" Essentially, questions like these help stakeholders shore up strengths in their thinking and compensate for limitations.</p><a id="AN0140321873-30"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-30" title="Evaluating Rigor in TIU Research">Evaluating Rigor in TIU Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This section offers criteria for evaluating the rigor of a TIU-based study.

Researchers have developed numerous criteria for evaluating interpretive research, some of which mirror the commonly used criteria of reliability and validity.

For this reason, we adapt the four criteria (credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability) for evaluating the rigor of TIU-based research and indicate tests researchers can use to demonstrate (and evaluate) the rigor of their new theories. Importantly, while these four criteria are useful, we suggest they need to be complemented by a fifth criterion—distinctiveness—that refers to the novelty of a theory's constructs and propositions (relative to extant literature). This criterion is central for evaluating TIU research whose aim is the construction of new theory.

Their responses (potentially combined with extant theories and findings in the literature) can be instrumental in constructing persuasive arguments for the new theory's if-then propositions. We also recommend asking participants range-spanning questions to encourage them to consider the full range of constructs involved (e.g., very high to very low; e.g., [27]). For example, if some participants indicate that strong loyalty programs lead to higher market shares, it is useful to ask subsequent participants (or the same participants later in course of the conversations) about the consequences of having weak loyalty programs along with the reasons for those consequences. If participants indicate that one of the consequences is low market share and they provide the same argument for it, documenting this information is likely to increase the theory's credibility.

For example, researchers using a TIU approach typically develop abstract constructs from specific data (instances, examples) provided by participants. In such cases, researchers can demonstrate confirmability through interjudge reliability. This involves researchers providing two or more judges the raw/verbatim data (or a random sampling thereof) and the names of their abstract constructs and having them code the raw/verbatim data into the constructs. Following this, interjudge agreement may be computed (e.g., using proportional reduction in loss proposed by [50]]). Similarly, researchers can demonstrate confirmability by documenting agreement between two or more independent judges asked to indicate the extent to which a theory's if-then propositions correspond to the data from which they were created. Researchers can also demonstrate confirmability by providing thick descriptions of their data (e.g., verbatim participant quotes) in their reports to enable readers of the theory to do a direct assessment of the extent to which theoretical constructs, propositions, and arguments advanced in the theories are consistent with the raw data used to construct them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As noted previously, data from TIU research participants can stimulate a researcher to develop if-then propositions that were not cited or directly suggested by any of the participants.

In such cases, we caution against strict adherence to the confirmability criterion and instead suggest using theory credibility as the more important criterion.

Construct distinctiveness may be demonstrated by definitional comparisons—comparing the proposed definition of a new construct with definitions of existing constructs that are closest to the meaning of the new construct. Proposition distinctiveness refers to the extent to which if-then propositions differ from theoretical propositions already available in the literature.

First, TIU, as a technique used largely for theory construction, is not suited for theory testing. However, as we have shown, TIU can be a terrific setup for guiding downstream theory-testing efforts. Second, researchers often lack (but can still acquire) the requisite skill and experience needed for doing successful interviews with key informants. Using the recommendations in this article is a good start. Next, reading the TIU research delineated in our Tables 2 and 3 will help. Finally, practicing interviews with other researchers using TIU can prepare a researcher to conduct interviews with actual participants.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, TIU works only when informants have sufficient knowledge and experience. For relatively new phenomena (e.g., a firm operating as a platform as well as a supplier on the platform), participants are unlikely to have well-developed theories about their long-term effects and/or the conditions under which the effects are likely to be strong or weak. Participants in these situations may still espouse theories, but they are less likely to be the product of thoughtful processing of meaningful experience. An idea about a relatively unfamiliar issue could be an uncertain participant's guess as opposed to a highly relevant but newly discovered "aha."</p><a id="AN0140321873-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-38" title="Future Research">Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As we have noted, the discipline of marketing is at the crossroads. Others have suggested that if we continue on our current trajectory, we will simply accelerate our path to irrelevance ([47]). One promising method to increase relevance to all stakeholders in the marketing system is a TIU approach. Relevant stakeholders may be managers aiming to improve practice, consumers aiming to enhance their consumption experiences, and/or policy makers aiming to improve society. In this section, we turn our attention to three specific areas of future research. The first two future research areas focus on direct applications of TIU. The first application area is non-domain-specific. Here, the emphasis is on identifying "meta issues" that can richly inform any subfield of marketing (e.g., when stakeholders disagree, when core assumptions underlying a body of work are questionable), whereas the second is focused is domain-specific (e.g., role of marketing in the firm, organic growth, digital transformation). The third category involves research on TIU as a method.</p><a id="AN0140321873-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-39" title="Future Research: Meta Domains">Future Research: Meta Domains</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this section, we consider research topics that could apply to any field or subfield of marketing.

A theory built on an assumption that is not fully explored may be incomplete or may even contain errors. The published literature often identifies and debates such assumptions. For example, the literature on market orientation currently has two dominant perspectives—one focusing on processing marketplace information ([27]) and the other focused on a market-oriented culture ([38]). However, both perspectives assume that understanding customer needs and putting customers at the "center of your business" is essential for success. An interesting question to be explored using a TIU approach would be "When do customer needs <em>not</em> matter?" or "Under what conditions should the customer <em>not</em> be at the center of the business?" The notion of building businesses around customer is at the heart of our discipline, yet it could be challenged by examining successful businesses that have taken a different approach. From a public policy perspective, there is an assumption that it is "always" best build a business around a customer; however, this assumption can also be reexamined. When do customer-oriented businesses increase consumer costs and lessen customer satisfaction?</p><a id="AN0140321873-41"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-41" title="Conflicting firm and customer viewpoints">Conflicting firm and customer viewpoints</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A TIU approach can be very productive when a firm's or even industry's "theory" of its behavior in the marketplace is at odds with their customers' "theory" of the firm's or industry's intentions and actions. Comparing manager theories or maps of their actions with those customers hold about the same actions can help a firm or industry achieve a better alignment with its customer base. A contemporary example involves current viewpoints regarding the pricing of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. Here there are conflicting views held by firms (e.g., high prices support the portfolio of R&amp;D efforts, some of which work and others do not), policy makers (e.g., consumer affordability), and customers (e.g., price gouging).</p><a id="AN0140321873-42"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-42" title="Conflict among key stakeholders">Conflict among key stakeholders</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A TIU approach may make clear where key stakeholders agree or disagree and what options exist that can foster agreement among them.

Research in this domain could also closely examine the implications of digital transformation for the marketing organization within a firm. For example, whereas social media is largely viewed as an avenue for advertising and promotions, several firms are actively using social media channels for customer service, direct sales, and market research (see, e.g., efforts of KLM, the Snickers "Hungerithm" campaign).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Digital transformation of industries and markets requires executives to rethink next-generation marketing resources, capabilities, and skills their companies need to secure and grow to engage with customers in new and meaningful ways in the digital age. For example, companies today increasingly focus on rolling out new subscription-based business models. In line with this fundamental trend, a growing number of firms invest in new organizational functions, such as customer success management; they hire new staff across all hierarchical levels, from vice presidents of customer success to customer success associates. Clearly, key decision makers add new customer-facing roles and responsibilities to complement others in existing areas, such as customer experience management or key account management. What are executives' mental models underlying such decisions? Which TIUs guide managers in growing these novel marketing competencies?

The aim is to protect consumers at multiple levels—by including access to personal data (e.g., health records finance), limiting hacking, and, more generally, maintaining personal privacy. A TIU approach would be particularly useful in assessing the trade-offs that consumers are willing to make regarding the balance of sharing versus protecting their personal information. This is important wherever paradox arises, such when consumers insist on greater protection of personal data while enjoying the benefits of more personally relevant information and firm offerings resulting from firms mining their personal data. A TIU approach can be valuable in surfacing moderators that help consumers resolve such paradoxes.</p><a id="AN0140321873-48"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-48" title="Health care policy">Health care policy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the United States, a particularly contentious debate is unfolding regarding single-payer systems, the role of government in delivering health care solutions, and the overall cost of health care. While these are large, complex issues, behind the scenes there is a sense that there are two diametrically opposed worldviews that "set context" for the debates. One of the authors of this article has been involved in a TIU project aiming to better understand how Democrats and Republicans view health care disparities to overcome political gridlock. The overall objective was to understand the fundamental frames both groups used to understand health disparities and help develop a campaign that would push the issue forward without alienating either group. It was found that, contrary to public expressions, there were important commonalities as well as differences between the two parties that served as a shared foundation for discussing their differences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second health care topic is connected health care. Ensuring that patients take their medicine as prescribed and achieving compliance is both a societal goal and a company goal, but what about consumers' position? Increasingly the topic of connected health becomes intertwined with privacy concerns. Many firms now remotely monitor patient compliance through medical devices (e.g., sleep apnea machines with embedded chips) and, as a result, the patient, physician, channel intermediaries, and insurance firms all have access to patient data. The overall system improvements—reimbursement based on actual compliance, better patient flow management in doctor's office, and reduced labor costs for the channel—are all very positive. However, we do not have a deep understanding of the patients' positive and negative views on connected health care.</p><a id="AN0140321873-49"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-49" title="Government involvement and regulation">Government involvement and regulation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Increasingly governments are more involved in the day-to-day affairs of for-profit and nonprofit organizations.

These could be for economic reasons (e.g., adverse influence on their profitability) and/or for constituency reasons (e.g., a firm is based in a region that highly depends on that particular industry sector).

For instance, children often have well-developed TIUs, but eliciting them is a special challenge requiring more novel probing and elicitation processes. Separately, some probing techniques may work best in face-to-face interviews but less well for those conducted online. These are all situations requiring more study.</p><a id="AN0140321873-53"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321873-53" title="Alternative probing techniques">Alternative probing techniques</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some topics are inherently more challenging than others for respondents to address.

As such, the overall objective of this article is to inspire and provide guidance on the development of knowledge based on the TIU approach. A key message of this article is that while the TIU approach requires skill, tradecraft, and practice, it has resulted in multiple breakthrough, award-winning research articles (e.g., see Table 2). These articles represent important organic marketing theories that have paved the way for long-lasting research streams that continue to inspire scholarly research today.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While impact may be a sufficient motivation, there are two additional benefits of pursuing this approach. First, researchers using this approach often find that gleaning new insights this way is a special variant of fun. The fun involves the excitement of discovering something novel as well as getting closer to the marketing phenomena. Giving time to executives, consumers, and policy makers to explore their own thinking is also rewarding. Furthermore, having one's own ideas challenged by interviewees can shake a scholar out of the routine of reviewing literature written by other academics ([32]). Second, TIU research not only represents a great vehicle for bringing relevance to the classroom but also provides a platform for sharing real-time stories and challenges that are unfolding in practice. Moreover, in our experience, managers taking part in the research are often excited about the prospect of becoming long-term partners in the research and education process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, if the field of marketing is to continue to have relevance for the practice of marketing, we must develop ideas, concepts, and theories whose central focus is the study of marketing in its natural environment. Within this environment, managers, consumers, and policy makers are a wonderful source of new ideas, unconventional thinking, and ways of working that can fundamentally reshape our current thinking and theories. One can "go it alone" by reading marketing literature and coming up with ideas, or one can capitalize on the knowledge of managers, consumers, and public policy makers who are dealing with significant, underresearched challenges every day.

This study approaches the topic of customer value for measuring, managing, and maximizing customer contributions by proposing a customer valuation theory (CVT) based on economic principles that conceptualizes the generation of value from customers to firms. The author reviews the established economic theories for valuing investor assets (e.g., stocks) and draws a comparison to valuing customer contributions. Furthermore, the author recognizes the differences in the guiding principles between valuing stocks and valuing customers in proposing CVT. Using CVT, the author discusses the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) as the metric that can provide a reliable, forward-looking estimate of direct customer value. In addition, economic models to estimate CLV, ways to manage CLV using portfolio management principles, and strategies to maximize CLV are discussed in detail. The author extends the customer value concept by discussing ways that a customer can add value to the firm indirectly through incentivized referrals, social media influence, and feedback. Finally, the benefits of CVT to multiple constituencies are offered.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Any sustainable business first creates value for its customers through firm offerings1 and, in the process, derives value from its customers in the form of profit.2 This duality of roles performed by firms and customers to derive and deliver value best summarizes the firm–customer relationship from a value standpoint. However, this value is distributed heterogeneously across customers. Because it is the firms/decision makers who allocate resources to markets, customers, and products, the challenge in this context for firms is to dynamically align resources spent on customers and products to simultaneously generate both value to customers and value from customers. In addition, the volatility and vulnerability in customer cash flows differentially affects overall firm profitability. These changes can be due to both customer actions and firm actions. For instance, especially in business markets, leadership change in the customer organization influences procurement decisions that can result in changes in future cash flows. Similarly, customer life events (e.g., getting divorced, becoming empty nesters) can also affect future cash flows. Therefore, firms look for ways to better manage cash flows (Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1999).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To better understand and manage the value creation and cash flow management process, this article proposes a theory to value future customer contributions: the customer valuation theory (CVT). The CVT focuses on two aspects of customer financial contributions: their nature (i.e., direct and indirect) and their scope (i.e., breadth and depth). In doing so, the CVT informs firms about (<a id="bib1up

The robustness of the CVT is also highlighted through its successful implementation across various types of markets (consumer and business), scenarios (contractual and noncontractual business settings), contexts (domestic and global), and industries (e.g., insurance, airline, retail). Furthermore, the widespread positive impact of implementing CVT on multiple constituents of the market such as the firms, the customers, the employees, the society, and the environment is also identified.</p><a id="AN0127019658-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-2" title="Valuing Assets: A Contextual Background">Valuing Assets: A Contextual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">What is an asset? Despite the conflicting viewpoints on the role and constituents of an asset or firm resource (Mahoney and Pandian 1992), an asset can be broadly defined as any physical, organizational, or human attribute that enables the firm to generate and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace (Barney 1991). Given the prominence of assets in deploying firm strategies and gaining competitive advantage, the next question is, What makes them valuable? Here too, scholars from diverse fields such as finance, industrial organization, management, and economics have presented several approaches to decode an asset’s value. With specific reference to marketing, academics and practitioners consider customers as assets and have instated strategies that manage and nurture customers rather than use them only for specific marketing actions. In this regard, studies have investigated customer asset valuation from various viewpoints such as firm valuation (Gupta, Lehmann, and Stuart 2004; Kumar and Shah 2009), customer management (Berger et al. 2002), and financial performance (Hogan et al. 2002), among others. The differing approaches to asset valuation notwithstanding, the true value of an asset is most often observed in its interactions in the external marketplace. This leads to the next question: How are assets valued? To better understand the approach to value assets, consider two scenarios—an investor investing in stocks, and a firm investing in its customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the case of the investor (which applies to both individual and institutional investors), the valuation of stocks forms a crucial component.

In reality, performing each of these three actions is not always possible because of certain challenges.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The comparison between the case of the investor and the firm shows the similarity in how they manage their respective assets (stocks vs. customers). So, can the principles that guide the valuation of stocks be applied in valuing customers? To answer this question, the challenges of valuing customers must first be understood.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, firms need a reliable method to identify and invest in the “right” customers. While it may seem straightforward to say that the “right” customers are the ones who exhibit the highest value potential, the specifics may not be so apparent. Traditionally, value measures have focused on repeat purchases, acquisition cost, retention cost, tenure, and share of wallet, among others. Thus, a valuation approach that can accurately capture these intricacies for firms to identify the most valuable customers is essential.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, configuring a portfolio of the most valuable customers is easier said than done. The customer characteristics (e.g., consumption pattern, lifestyle habits) that determine their value potential have been found to change over time (Kumar 2013). As a result, periodic evaluation of customer value measures (e.g., profitability) is a necessary and reliable method to help managers in the vital job of keeping track of changing customer characteristics. Furthermore, regulated monopolies such as telephone and municipality services are often required to cross-subsidize one group of customers with another (e.g., rural and urban customers). In such cases, firms may not be able to build the ideal portfolio of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, rebalancing of customers is not a feasible strategy. Although cases have been reported in which companies have fired customers because profitability concerns (Reardon 2007), this is not a common practice. For instance, many banks are unable to “fire” the unprofitable customers, especially if they are from lower socioeconomic groups or minority groups. In addition, churn is a challenge that firms constantly face. While a firm may want to have profitable customers, holding on to those customers typically poses challenges for the firm. Therefore, firms need a reliable way to discern how to manage unprofitable customers as well as ways to nurture profitable customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Therefore, in this study, I present the case for a valuation approach that is specifically designed to value customer assets. In doing so, I demonstrate why the stock valuation approach is not readily applicable to valuing customer assets and show how customer assets are uniquely positioned to provide value to the firm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/14n1.jpg" alt="14n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 1 Summary of

The research insights generated since then have led to the consideration of customers as integral to organizations (Gupta and Lehmann 2005; Shah et al. 2006). In this regard, studies have considered customers to be intangible assets of a firm (Hunt and Morgan 1995; Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998) and have proposed approaches to valuing and managing their contributions to the firm (Bolton, Lemon, and Verhoef 2004; Reinartz and Kumar 2000).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies have also focused on applying customer value to enhance firm performance from various perspectives such as the role of customer acquisition strategies (Lewis 2006), customer retention strategies (Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar 2005), customer loyalty (Reinartz and Kumar 2002), customer satisfaction (Anderson and Mittal 2000), resource allocation (Petersen and Kumar 2015), and customer metrics (Petersen et al. 2009; Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009), among others. Such attempts continue to shape profitable customer management (based on future customer profitability) for both contractual and noncontractual business settings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research on customer value has also explored the volatility and uncertainty of future revenue contributions. In this regard, studies have identified that certain behavioral drivers on the part of customers (e.g., level of purchases, product return behavior) determine the level and volatility of cash flows (Kumar, Shah, and Venkatesan 2006; Reinartz and Kumar 2003). Therefore, the management of behavioral drivers is critical in valuing customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Why Are Financial Theories Inappropriate for Valuing Customers?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior studies have investigated the application of financial theories to marketing decisions. For instance, Cardozo and Smith (1983) proposed an approach for making product portfolio decisions by applying the financial portfolio theory. However, Devinney, Stewart, and Shocker (1985) highlighted critical differences regarding applying a financial theory in a product decision setting. Similarly, Tarasi et al. (2011) demonstrated the application of financial portfolio theory for making customer portfolio decisions, which subsequently attracted critical review in the literature (Billett 2011; Selnes 2011). Other efforts that have incorporated concepts from financial theories into marketing applications include the introduction of customer beta that measures the riskiness of customers (Dhar and Glazer 2003), a customer relationship scorecard based on customers’ risk–return characteristics (Ryals 2003), and the management of customer segments using portfolio theory (Bolton and Tarasi 2015; Buhl and Heinrich 2008; Groening et al. 2014). In light of these efforts to apply financial theories for valuing customers, some principal differences between finance and marketing must be noted. Figure 1 illustrates these differences as well as how they ultimately affect firm value. They are as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• It is possible to invest money into stocks and achieve a higher amount in return. However, this is not possible in the case of customers. Firms know that beyond a certain point, investing more money in their customers will yield a lower rate of return. In other words, whereas the investment-to-earnings relationship can be linear in the case of stocks, it is nonlinear in the case of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Investors can be fairly certain about a stock’s “life expectancy” and the survival of that firm. However, firms that invest in customers can make no such conclusion about their customers. In other words, investors have relatively more information about how long the stocks in which they have invested will remain in trading, compared with firms’ knowledge of how long their customers will remain their customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• In the case of widely held stocks (i.e., those that are not closely controlled by investors and fund owners), if a stock begins to perform poorly, the investor has the option of quickly divesting that stock. After divesting, the investor has the option of either buying another stock or just holding on to the cash. However, firms typically do not have prior information about how much value a customer is going to bring in. Furthermore, changes in customer lifestyles may make customers less profitable or may even cause losses. In such a case, the firm typically does not “divest” of such loss-making customers but has to find ways to manage them appropriately. This is also true in certain business settings (e.g., oil industry) in which it is difficult for suppliers to exit a customer relationship. In some cases, such situations can lead to speculative business practices such as stockpiling. In other words, the value and volume of investments in stocks is easily scalable, compared with the investments in customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Investors routinely buy and sell stocks that will increase the value to the portfolio and/or minimize the risk of losing value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, firms that invest in customers do not have the luxury of hiring and firing customers. As a result, a low-value customer is still likely to be part of a firm’s customer portfolio, and firms will have to find ways to manage these customers in such a manner that they do not lose firm value. In other words, rebalancing a stock portfolio is easier than rebalancing a customer portfolio.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Although investors value their investments in widely held stocks in line with the projected cash flows of the respective stocks,4 firms that have invested in their customers assess the value of their customers on the basis of customer contributions to firm revenue, which determines the stock price and, ultimately, the firm’s value. Recognizing this chain of impact is important in developing a metric that can effectively track the firm’s value creation. In other words, whereas the impact of investing in customers can be observed on the value of stocks (and, ultimately, on firm value), investing in widely held stocks has a limited observable impact on the value of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Using financial theories, it is possible for investors to identify the types of risks to which stocks are exposed (e.g., given the economic cycles) and recognize the ones that can be diversified from the ones that cannot. However, firms that have invested in their customers cannot readily identify the risks from customer contributions, or their impact on profitability. In other words, it is relatively easier to identify (and therefore manage) risks arising from investments in stocks compared with investments in customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Investor sentiments play an important role in investment decisions (Weber and Johnson 2009). Stock market operations involve investor sentiments regarding a firm’s future performance expectations, which, in turn, determine the level of attractiveness of that firm in the industry. In contrast, the influence of investor sentiment is not a significant force when valuing a customer’s direct contribution. However, for customers who are based in politically unstable regions, the valuation is different more for sentimental reasons than for economic reasons. In other words, the importance of investor sentiment is higher in the valuation of stocks than in the valuation of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Speculation also plays an important role in investment decisions. For instance, speculation is based on a rational betting decision that is known to stabilize asset prices (Friedman 1953) and is sometimes based on insider trading (Kyle 1985). Furthermore, it is known that if the investment actions of rational speculators trigger the buying of securities when prices rise and selling when prices fall, then an increase in the number of forward-looking speculators can increase volatility about the asset fundamentals (De Long et al. 1990). In contrast, speculation does not play a major role when assessing the value of a customer. In other words, the importance of speculation is higher in the valuation of stocks than in the valuation of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Drawing on known future discounted cash flows, an investor typically decides on his or her choice of investment. That is, the options are limited to either investment or divestment. As a result, investors generally cannot influence the future cash flow patterns of a firm to change the course of their own actions. In other words, financial theories offer a passive approach to managing investments, whereas customer management requires an active management approach.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• The volatility and vulnerability of stocks make it difficult for investors to predict stock returns in the short run. Short-term returns are difficult to predict because of their random walk feature (Jensen 1978; Malkiel 1995). In addition, Kumar, Ramaswami, and Srivastava (2000) observe that daily returns are sensitive to random disturbances in the market. To predict stock movements, they offset the effect of random disturbances by considering a longer time period such as a month. Using the principles advanced by the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory, the study developed a multistage model to study variation in stock returns. The study found that the addition of significant factors other than the market factors (i.e., cost and supply of money) increases the level of risk, which results in a decrease in the price of the firm. In this regard, appropriately designed marketing actions directed at the environmental uncertainties (i.e., macroeconomic factors) can lessen the impact on the firm’s cash flows, because predictions of customer value are accurate in the short run. Therefore, estimating the value of customers and pairing this value with appropriately designed marketing strategies can place firms on the path to increased financial returns. The level of predictive accuracy of customer value, however, declines only in the long run. In other words, a more accurate prediction of stock returns is possible only in the long run, compared with the prediction of customer value, which is more accurate in the short run.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to the financial theories, knowledge from behavioral finance is also relevant here. Behavioral finance literature has argued that some financial phenomena can reasonably be understood using models in which some agents are not fully rational (Barberis and Thaler 2003). With specific reference to investor behavior, behavioral finance has explained how certain investor groups behave, the types of portfolios investors hold, and investors’ trading patterns over time. Barberis and Thaler (2003) trace investor behaviors such as having insufficient diversification of portfolios (Baxter and Jermann 1997), opting for simpler diversification strategies (Benartzi and Thaler 2001), having high trading volumes (Barber and Odean 2000), holding on to stocks even if they are decreasing in value (Odean 1998), and considering “attention-getting” stocks for their purchase decisions (Barber and Odean 1999) to demonstrate that investors are not always rational in their investment decisions. This stream of literature has established that investors’ attitudes and behaviors are of vital importance. In light of the aforementioned differences between customers and stocks, I develop the CVT as a robust theory for valuing customer assets by adopting a different approach than that used to value stocks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">How Does Customer Valuation Work?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From the previous discussion of the determinants of customer assets, one of the approaches to value customers in a general form is presented next:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">CFPi = f (Transaction behaviori, Marketing costi, Demographic=firmographic variablesi, Economic and environmental factors ), where CFPi refers to customer future profitability of customer i.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Simply put, the future profitability of the customers depends on their past and current transaction behaviors, the marketing efforts of the firm, the identity and profile of the customers (i.e., demographic variables), and the environment in which these customers exist (i.e., economic and environmental factors). Furthermore, when modeling CFP, statistical issues such as heterogeneity, endogeneity, and simultaneity are factored in the estimation of such models. Once the CFP is modeled, business intelligence software systems can be used to score CFP, update customer information, and rescore CFP on a periodic basis. Technology can also be incorporated to target customers on a real-time basis through relevant messages in an effort to increase future cash flows. Drawing on this valuation approach, I advance the following testable propositions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Transaction behavior. Also known as exchange characteristics, the transaction behavior broadly includes all the past and current transaction variables that affect and influence the customer–firm relationship. The commitment-trust theory (Morgan and Hunt 1994) proposes that firms try to establish positive relationships with customers by developing commitment and trust with them. While a customer’s positive affect influences his or her commitment to the firm, research has also uncovered other dimensions of customer commitment. For instance, Allen and Meyer (1990) proposed a three-component model of commitment (affective, calculative, and normative). Recently, Keiningham et al. (2015) proposed customer commitment as a five-dimension construct (affective, normative, economic, forced, and habitual). Beyond repeat purchases, purchase habits have been found to play an important role in determining customer transaction behavior (Ascarza, Iyengar, and Schleicher 2016; Duhigg 2013). Specifically, research has reported that customer habits influence the future volatility and vulnerability of cash flows (Shah et al. 2017) and firm performance (Shah, Kumar, and Kim 2014). Furthermore, the importance of primary market research in understanding customer behavior patterns has also been highlighted, especially in light of the abundance of behavioral information made possible by big data (Knowledge@ Wharton 2014). As a result, frequent customer–firm interactions should increase customer trust and commitment in the firm at a faster rate, provided that the interactions are satisfactory. Therefore,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">P1: Customer transaction activities significantly influence customer future profitability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This proposition has been tested across various industries and markets (business to business [B2B] and business to customer [B2C]), and research has found that customer future profitability is positively influenced by a host of variables, including (<a id="bib1up

In addition, studies have also found the average interpurchase time and the number of product returns to have a significantly positive impact on customer future profitability, up to a certain threshold (Reinartz and Kumar 2003).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Marketing cost. Marketing cost can include past, current, and future promotional costs (toward customer acquisition, retention, and win-back); technology upgrades; service improvements; employee management; and quality control. The importance of effective management of customer assets to enhance firm profitability (Bolton, Lemon, and Verhoef 2004) has directed research attention toward understanding the impact of marketing expenditures on customer value and actively using marketing communication actions (i.e., customer contact channels) to maximize customer value. Prior research has established that well-timed communication efforts (Kumar, Venkatesan, and Reinartz 2008) and well-managed content (Kim and Kumar 2018) between firms and customers reduces the propensity of a customer to quit a relationship (Morgan and Hunt 1994). However, too much communication has also been found to be detrimental to the relationship (Fournier, Dobscha, and Mick 1998), thereby indicating the presence of an optimal communication level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">P2: Marketing cost nonlinearly influences customer future profitability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies have revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between marketing contacts (involving rich modes [e.g., sales personnel contact] and standardized modes [e.g., telephone, direct mail]) and customer behavior (Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar 2005; Venkatesan, Kumar, and Bohling 2007). Furthermore, in a permission-based marketing context, a firm’s marketing contact policy influences both the length of time a customer stays in an email program and the average amount a customer spends on a transaction while (s)he is subscribed to the email program; too much marketing may not only make customers less likely to opt in but also cause them to opt out more quickly (Kumar, Zhang, and Luo 2014).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Demographic/firmographic variables. Demographic/firmographic variables refer to the distinguishing characteristics of the customer (end user or business customer). In the case of a business customer, the firmographic variables include the type of industry, the age and size of the firm, the level of annual revenue, and the location of the business. In the case of an end user, the demographic variables include age, gender, income, and the physical location of the customers. The demographic/ firmographic variables can aid firms in characterizing attractive segments into identifiable and measurable groups of customers (Zeithaml 2000). In the case of end users, the heterogeneity in profit contributions can be better understood through a customer’s demographic and psychographic variables (Chintagunta, Jain, and Vilcassim 1991); demographic variables affect customer store choice (Craig, Ghosh, and McLafferty 1984), shopping channel choice (Inman, Shankar, and Ferraro 2004), profitable lifetime duration (Reinartz and Kumar 2003), and migration of shopping choice (Thomas and Sullivan 2005), to name a few. As a result, classifying customers on the basis of their distinguishing characteristics can help firms in their customer segmentation and customer relationship management efforts. Therefore,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">P3: Demographic/firmographic variables significantly influence customer future profitability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The testing of this proposition has revealed that demographic variables such as household income, population density of the neighborhood, gender, age of the head of the household, marital status, education level, and so forth significantly affect future customer profitability (Kumar, George, and Pancras 2008; Kumar, Shah, and Venkatesan 2006). Furthermore, research has also established that firmographic variables such as the size of the firm and the industry category of the business customers significantly explained the variation in contribution margin for the focal firm (Venkatesan and Kumar 2004). Specifically, Venkatesan and Kumar (2004) found that the focal firm’s business customers in the financial services, technology, consumer packaged goods, and government industry categories provided, on average, a higher contribution margin than firms in other industry categories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Economic and environmental factors. Economic factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita help determine the consumption pattern of a country. It has been established that consumers’ response to macroeconomic factors is a function of not just their ability to buy (as measured by current and expected future income), but also their willingness to buy (Katona 1975). This underlying theory explains how various macroeconomic conditions affect price changes (Gordon, Avi, and Yang 2013), changes in consumers’ frame of mind (Chhaochharia, Korniotis, and Kumar 2011), and overall household utility (Kamakura and Du 2012), to name a few. Furthermore, research has also shown that changes in consumers’ economic constraints have varying effects on their profit-contributing potential. For instance, Sunder, Kumar, and Zhao (2016) demonstrated that high-CLV customers are least affected by changes in their budgetary constraints when compared with low-CLV customers. Therefore, if a country has a high GDP and high purchasing power, its consumers will have more disposable income and spend more.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">P4: Economic and environmental factors significantly influence a customer’s future profitability.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies that have tested this proposition have found that GDP per capita, the country’s economic well-being (how customers feel about and experience their daily lives), cultural characteristics, and the employment rate significantly influence future customer profitability (Kumar and Pansari 2016b; Kumar et al. 2014; Umashankar, Bhagwat, and Kumar 2016).</p><a id="AN0127019658-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-6" title="Customer Valuation Theory">Customer Valuation Theory</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In line with the customer valuation approach discussed previously, the CVT can be defined as a mechanism to measure the future value of each customer on the basis of (<a id="bib1up

Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the linkage between CVT and firm value. Figure 2 provides an overview of how the components of CVT function in driving firm value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, the proposed CVT is relevant for the following reasons:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Unlike prior marketing applications of the financial portfolio theory, this theory focuses on customer management at the individual customer level (on the basis of his or her profitability) instead of the customer segment level. Although customers are grouped in line with their profitability (i.e., high-, medium-, and low-profit segments), the subsequent strategies that are developed are always deployed at an individual customer level because this is more effective. Such an approach is different from how investors handle financial assets. The CVT implicitly accounts for customer risks (i.e., volatility and vulnerability in cash flows) when modeling future customer profitability. In doing so, the model focuses on how the risks ultimately affect customer profitability (and thereby, overall firm profitability) and treats it accordingly. For this reason, the CVT does not explicitly provide a beta value or any indicator for the risk-free return equivalent in the case of investments. Furthermore, the CVT enables managers to identify and manage the diversifiable risks through tailored offerings by focusing on the drivers of customer value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Because the CVT focuses on customer profitability, the variation in associated customer costs at the individual level are accounted for.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• The CVT is highly active in terms of generating actionable firm strategies. By dynamically managing the volatility and vulnerability in cash flows, this theory enables managers to actively monitor customer relationships over time and undertake necessary remedial measures. In comparison, the financial theories largely suggest that investors invest (or divest) at any point in time as determined by the discounted cash flow analyses. As a result, the financial theories remain passive by not providing adequate directions to investors such that they can influence future changes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• Because future costs drive future margins, the CVT-based strategies advise managers to better manage their acquisition and retention of profitable customers; by doing so, firms can actively refine and manage the customer valuation approach. However, no such option is available with investing in stocks because stocks yield fixed returns, and the investor cannot influence or manage the return on a stock.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">• The CVT recognizes the investment-to-earnings relationship, in the case of customers, to be nonlinear (unlike whenn valuing stocks), and it uses an appropriate customer valuation approach. This is subsequently reflected in customer strategies that can be developed.</p><a id="AN0127019658-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-7" title="Valuing Customers as Assets (Concepts)">Valuing Customers as Assets (Concepts)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The next component of the CVT delves into the concepts behind customer valuation and the related financial benefits they hold for firms. To contextualize the practice of customer valuation to the proposed theory, it is essential to review prior literature on this topic. In recent years, the idea of treating customers as assets of a firm has emerged as the most popular and efficient way of doing business (Hunt and Morgan 1995). This entails identifying future customer profitability and designing marketing guidelines that will advise managers on profitable customer management. Traditionally, firms have used several metrics to value customers (Kumar and Reinartz 2012; Petersen et al. 2009). The guidance from these metrics has driven decisions pertaining to the allocation of marketing resources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When considering a customer’s value contribution to the firm, a crucial part is his or her contribution in the future periods. It is this future component that is of immense interest to academics and practitioners. The concept of future value contribution has been conceptualized in the form of the CLV metric, which refers to the present value of future profits generated from a customer over his or her lifetime with the firm (Gupta and Lehmann 2005; Venkatesan and Kumar 2004).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The conceptualization of CLV was strongly influenced by the corporate finance body of knowledge, and specifically to the contribution of the present value concept by Irving Fisher (1965 [1930]) and Eugene Fama’s asset pricing theory (Fama and Miller 1972). Applying this knowledge to customer asset management, it is evident that customers pose risks in terms of generating returns for the firm in the future. However, the impact of these risks on customer profitability is not uniform across all customers. In this regard, the CLV approach identifies opportunities to contain the variation in returns (also known as cash flow volatility) and, thus, the total risk of changes in the value of the firm (measured by future returns) (Shah et al. 2017). This is possible by understanding the drivers of customer profitability and their impact on CLV.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the inspiration from other sciences such as economics and finance is apparent, the adaptation and inclusion into the customer asset valuation would not have been possible without the development of new methodologies specific to the marketing milieu. Specifically, the conceptualization of the CLV metric and the development of substantive methodologies served as a stepping stone for managing profitability by selecting the right customers for targeting and determining the allocation of resources for customer acquisition, retention, and growth. Furthermore, this important contribution also demonstrated that the CLV framework can help firms manage risk through appropriate actions directed at the individual customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Direct Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the valuation of assets/projects is typically done at the aggregate level, the CLV metric enables firms to capture the direct value contribution of customers at both the aggregate and the individual levels. At the aggregate level, the average lifetime value of a customer is derived from the lifetime value of a cohort, segment, or even a firm. Here, the estimation of CLV can be accomplished by identifying and measuring the factors that drive CLV. At the individual level, the CLV is calculated as the sum of cumulated cash flows—discounted using the weighted average cost of capital—of a customer over his or her entire lifetime with the company (Kumar 2008). It is a function of the predicted contribution margin, the propensity for a customer to continue in the relationship, and the marketing resources allocated to the customer. It is important to note that weighted average cost of capital is one of the measures that represent the discount factor used to compute CLV, among other options (e.g., T-bills rate). In its general form, CLV can be expressed as follows (Venkatesan and Kumar 2004):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where i is the customer index, t is the time index, T refers to the number of time periods considered for estimating CLV, and d is the discount rate.5 The CVT proposed in this study is based on the individual-level CLV rather than the aggregate level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although a “true” CLV measure implies measuring the customer’s value over his or her lifetime, for most applications it is a three-year window.6 The reasons for this time frame are as follows: (<a id="bib1up

However, specific industry trends do lead to some exceptions for this three-year window. For instance, automakers can expect customers to make a purchase every four to six years (we suggest using a longer window to accommodate at least a couple of purchases or using purchase intention measures to forecast future value), computer manufacturers can expect customers to make a purchase every one to two years (we suggest a four- to five-year window to account for at least two or three purchases); and insurance companies can take up to seven years to recover the acquisition costs. Exceptions aside, the aforementioned reasons advocate the use of a three-year timeframe in computing the CLV.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The extant CLV literature has covered a wide range of business conditions through the measurement approaches. This coverage has expanded the scope and application of CLV-based models for a multitude of industries and markets. Some of the later developments in modeling CLV have accommodated several modeling challenges, which has allowed for more sophisticated and precise estimation of customer value. Kumar and Reinartz (2016) provide a detailed review of select approaches that have made significant contributions in modeling CLV. Table 1 offers a summary of the model form as well as merits and shortcomings of popular modeling approaches.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although the models discussed here are the most popular ones, there will always be improvements to the CLV model because of the nature of the availability of customer data and the business situation. In addition, the knowledge of how to implement the models is also important in determining how CLV can be managed at different firms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Depth of Direct Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The depth of direct economic value contributions, as measured by CLV, have focused on the impact of customers’ direct profit contributions to the firm through their own purchases. Tracking and valuing these contributions have produced significant financial results for the implementing firms. In this regard, recent research has demonstrated that when firms try to understand and leverage the true power of measuring and maximizing CLV, it ultimately results in enhanced firm value (Berger et al. 2002; Kumar, Ramaswami, and Srivastava 2000; Kumar and Shah 2009). Furthermore, Kumar (2008, 2013) explored the implications and generated the “Wheel of Fortune” strategies that have enabled firms to address marketing issues with greater confidence and ensure better decision making. This set of strategies answers the following questions:</p><ol><li><span class="medium-normal"> Customer selection: How do firms identify the “right” customers to manage? Reinartz and Kumar (2000) found that long-life customers are not necessarily profitable customers, and the authors call for the use of a forward-looking metric such as CLV to identify the “right” customers to manage.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Managing repeat purchases and profitability simultaneously: How can firms ensure profitability while improving customer repeat purchases? When customized actions were implemented at a B2C catalog retailer on the basis of segmenting customers on repeat purchases and profitability, Reinartz and Kumar (2002) found that loyal customers are aware of their value to the company and demand premium service, believe they deserve lower prices, and spread positive word of mouth only if they feel and act loyal.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Optimal allocation of resources: Which customers should the firms interact with through inexpensive channels (e.g., Internet, phone), and which customers should firms let go? When resources were reallocated on the basis of the optimal mix and frequency of communication channels, a B2B company realized 100% more revenue and 83% more profits across its four customer segments (Venkatesan and Kumar 2004).</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Cross-buy: How can customers’ purchases be increased across multiple product categories to improve customer profitability? By encouraging customers to buy across more product categories through profitable customer management strategies, Kumar, George, and Pancras (2008) found that metrics such as revenue per order, margin per order, revenue per month, margin per month, and orders per month increased as customers shopped across multiple product categories. However, not all cross-buying is good. Shah et al. (2012) found that across five B2B and B2C firms, 10%–35% of the firms’ customers who cross-buy are unprofitable and account for a significant proportion (39%–88%) of the firms’ total loss from its customers. Therefore, discerning profitable from unprofitable cross-buying behavior is essential.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Next logical product: How do firms decide the timing of an offering to a customer? When done right, results have shown that firms increased their profits by an average of $1,600 per customer, representing an increase in return on investment (ROI) of 160% (Kumar, Venkatesan, and Reinartz 2006).</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Preventing customer attrition: How do firms decide which prospect will make a better customer in the future and is therefore worthwhile to acquire? Using test and control groups, Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar (2005) showed that acquiring and retaining the “right” customers garnered a B2C firm an incremental profit of $345,800 with an ROI close to 860%.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Product returns: Should the firm encourage or discourage product return behavior, and how should it manage this process? Petersen and Kumar (2009) found that the ideal level of product returns should be one that maximizes firm profits. For a B2C catalog retailer, they found that the optimal percentage of product returns that maximized profitability was 13%. Furthermore, Petersen and Kumar (2015) addressed the aspects of perceived risk and optimal resource allocation into the product returns process for a B2C catalog retailer and found that the firm was able to generate approximately $300,000 more in profits compared with the next best available resource allocation strategy.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Managing multichannel shoppers: What kind of sales and service resources should firms allocate to current customers to conduct future business with them? Kumar and Venkatesan (2005) identified the drivers of profitable multichannel shopping behavior and found that adding one more channel resulted in an average net gain of about 80% in profits.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Branding and customer profitability: Should firms invest in building brands or customers? Kumar, Luo, and Rao (2016) have shown that by understanding the link between investments in branding and CLV, firms can efficiently allocate their resources to improving customer brand value to generate maximum lifetime value. It was found that a 5% increase in the investments in branding causes the CLV to increase by over 25%.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Acquiring profitable customers: How should firms monitor customer activity to readjust the form and intensity of their marketing initiatives? In managing firm actions regarding customer acquisition and retention efforts, Reinartz, Thomas, and Kumar (2005) found that it is not sufficient to consider how much to spend on acquisition or retention alone but, instead, firms need to consider how they must balance acquisition and retention spending together to maximize profitability and double the ROI.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Interaction orientation: Ramani and Kumar (2008) ask, Should firms realign themselves to realize augmented CLV?

With respect to indirect customer contributions to profit, promoting customer referrals is a popular practice adopted by firms. The CRV metric captures the net present value (NPV) of the future profits of new customers who purchased the firm offerings as a result of the referral behavior of the current customer (Kumar, Petersen, and Leone 2010). Kumar, Petersen, and Leone (2007) showed that when targeted referral behavior campaigns were offered to select customers of a telecommunications firm, it resulted in overall value gains of $486,090, representing an ROI of 15.4. This study established that customers who score highly on CLV are not the same as those who are successful at referring new customers, and it made the case for measuring both CLV and CRV when evaluating marketing campaigns. To compute CRV, the first step is for firms to integrate their customer transaction database with the referral database. In the absence of referral behavior information, firms can collect it from new customers by asking questions such as, “Were you referred, and if so, by whom?” Or, “To what degree did the referral influence your decision to transact with us?” The CRV metric is, however, not relevant for all business situations. For instance, customersmay not make referralsif they are not attached to the product (e.g., fast-moving consumer goods). Furthermore, a customer recommendation for one product does not necessarily apply to the firm’s portfolio of products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The concept of referral behavior has also been extended to apply to the B2B relationship setting through the business reference value (BRV) metric. This metric computes the amount of profit the existing client firm can help generate from the prospect firms that purchase the firm offerings as a result of the client reference. Significant differences were found between high-BRV and low-BRV clients of a telecommunications and financial services firm, which indicated that, compared with low-BRV clients, high-BRV clients (<a id="bib1up

In an effort to conceptualize and metricize the customer influence on others, research has contributed two key metrics—customer influence effect (CIE) and CIV. Whereas the CIE measures the net spread and influence of a message from a particular individual, the CIV calculates the monetary gain or loss a firm experiences that is attributable to a customer, through his or her spread of positive or negative influence. Tracking these two metrics for a company’s social media campaign, Kumar et al. (2013) were able to demonstrate a 49% increase in brand awareness, 83% increase in ROI, and 40% increase in sales revenue growth rate. Although this study described the applicability of the CIE and CIV metrics in the case of an offline retailer, it can be extended to online retailers as well. Companies such as Starbucks and Staples already have established customer relationship management practices alongside a vibrant social media presence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">CKV. Because customer input is a valuable resource in the product development process, the value of this contribution needs to be captured and included as part of a customer’s value to the firm. This was captured in the conceptualization of the CKV metric, which refers to the monetary value attributed to a customer by a firm as a result of the profit generated by implementing an idea/suggestion/feedback from that customer. This customer feedback not only identifies the areas that are in need of improvement but also helps provide suggestions and solutions for future upgrades and modifications to firm offerings. This feedback has the potential to make the entire offering more attractive to existing and potential customers as well as improve process efficiencies. Customers must be attributed to the corresponding feedback to receive credit toward their asset value (Kumar and Bhagwat 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the value of customer feedback can be substantial to any firm, juxtaposing CLV with CKV can yield even greater insights to firms. Normally, customers with low CLVs have little experience with the product and/or they are likely to be unenthusiastic about the firm and therefore are likely to provide little feedback to the firm. Consequently, the higher a customer’s CLV, the more positive that customer will perceive the company and its products to be, and the more opportunities for the company to receive input. However, at very high levels of CLV (an indication of a close fit between the company’s products and a customer’s needs), the customers are likely to be highly satisfied and therefore have little incentive to provide feedback. These customers can, however, be encouraged to assist less experienced and less knowledgeable customers when firms implement a communication medium to do so.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer brand value. The three tangible value metrics—CRV, CIV, and CKV—collectively capture customers’ indirect profit contributions. In addition to these metrics, an attitudinal metric (intangible value)—customer brand value (CBV)—measures the value that the customer attaches to the brand as a result of all the marketing and communication messages delivered through different media. Conceptually, CBV refers to the total value a customer attaches to a brand through his or her experiences with the brand over time (Kumar, Luo, and Rao 2016). The CBV is a multidimensional metric that measures the customer’s brand knowledge, brand attitude, brand purchase intention, and brand behavior and enables companies to devise appropriate strategies depending on where the problem exists—awareness, trust, or repeat purchase.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Monitoring all the components of CBV becomes important from a branding standpoint. That is, brand-building efforts are aimed at inducing favorable behavior outcomes toward the brand, such as longer duration, higher purchase frequency, higher contribution margin, and positive customer referrals. Such behavioral outcomes determine the CLV scores. With this understanding, managers can work on optimizing the components of CBV to improve an individual’s CLV score. In this regard, Kumar (2013) shows that CBV is the foundation for managing CLV, CRV, CIV, and CKV.</p><a id="AN0127019658-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-8" title="Managing Customer Portfolios (Metrics)">Managing Customer Portfolios (Metrics)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The next component of the CVT relates to identifying the metrics to ascertain the value of customers. Firms constantly struggle with managing customers while ensuring profitability. In many cases, the cost of serving a customer may far exceed the returns from that customer. In such a scenario, firms are caught between retaining their customer portfolio/base and ensuring a healthy bottom line. The CLV metric will help firms manage healthy customer portfolios.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Direct Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As mentioned previously, the CLV stream of research has uncovered several resource reallocation insights that have helped firms maximize their value. Specifically, studies have focused on the magnitude of cash flows (the expected returns as measured by CLV) and on the volatility and variability of the cash flows (the risk element associated with customer revenue contributions). This dual focus has enabled firms to better understand customer portfolio decisions and manage customers. Through this process, it is possible to select and invest in customers who will optimize the overall customer cash flow while balancing the risk in cash flow variations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the concept of managing customer portfolios is similar to the financial portfolio theory, a couple of key differences must be noted. First, financial assets are typically classified in line with their historic risk/return characteristics. However, the same approach does not apply when treating customers as assets. Research has shown that past customer contributions are not highly correlated with future profit potential when using traditional or backward-looking metrics (Venkatesan and Kumar 2004). The CLV metric, in contrast, has been found to be a good predictor of future customer profitability. Second, finance managers typically invest in individual assets and try to maximize the portfolio’s return. However, marketing managers largely allocate resources at the customer segment level and increase customer profit. This is due to the nonlinear relationship between customer investments and returns. In other words, customer responses operate within certain thresholds of the level of marketing investments, and too few or too many marketing investments may not elicit the desired customer response. Whereas early studies have contributed to managing customer portfolios by optimizing segment-level risk/return (Buhl and Heinrich 2008; Reinartz and Kumar 2003; Tarasi et al. 2011), more recent studies are focusing on optimizing resource allocation at the individual customer level to maximize overall profitability (Kumar, Zhang, and Luo 2014; Luo and Kumar 2013; Petersen and Kumar 2015).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Depth of Direct Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To realize the full potential of customer contributions, firms must focus on the augmented customer value while managing customer portfolios. This is possible through optimal allocation of resources by prioritizing customers on their augmented profitability and their receptiveness to marketing efforts. To do so, decile analysis of the predicted CLV must be performed. Here, the baseline CLV (i.e., NPV of future profits that considers only the focal product category that the customer purchases) and the incremental CLV (i.e., NPV of future profits that considers customer purchases only from new product categories) are separately tracked. Conceptually, the augmented CLV is the sum of baseline CLV and the monetary impact of the portfolio of strategies discussed previously. Furthermore, the medium-value customers experience the highest gain from the portfolio of strategies—higher than even the high-value customers. This indicates the receptiveness of customers to firm-initiated marketing actions. Following this, firms can prioritize marketing resources and actions according to the impact on future profits and on firm value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A good way to understand the impact of optimal allocation of resources is through the firm’s usage of marketing communication channels (Venkatesan, Kumar, and Bohling 2007). To optimally allocate their resources, firms must first identify their most profitable customers and those who are the most responsive to marketing efforts. Performed at the individual customer level, the selection of the best mix of communication channels is determined on the basis of the responsiveness of each customer. The cost-effectiveness of these channels is also considered to measure the customers’ potential revenue contribution based on the contacts made. The firm then decides the frequency and interval of contacts through these channels to develop a customer contact strategy. Analyzing customer behavior in relation to these factors provides firms with valuable information about their customers’ preferences and attitudes. By carefully monitoring customers’ purchase frequency, the time elapsed between purchases, and the contribution margin, managers can determine the frequency of firm initiatives to maximize CLV through an optimal contact strategy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The benefits of optimal resource allocation using CLV as the metric can be observed even in a complex business setting. When IBM adopted the CLV metric to measure customer profitability and allocate resources for customers, the firm determined the level of contact and outreach efforts through telesales, email, direct mail, and catalogs on an individual customer basis. At the conclusion of this program (based on approximately 35,000 customers), IBM was able to effectively reallocate resources for approximately 14% of customers as well as increase revenues by about US$20 million. This was done without increasing the investment but by abandoning ineffective techniques based on customer spending history in favor of the CLV metric (Kumar et al. 2008).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Breadth of Indirect Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In managing customer portfolios, firms must realize that customers have multiple ways to contribute value, and all avenues have to be explored to maximize customer contributions. In this regard, the CLV metric has resulted in the creation of other metrics that can be used to manage and maximize customer value. These metrics must be managed independently, because a customer could contribute in one or more of these ways. Furthermore, firms must identify the ideal combination of direct and indirect value contribution from the metrics that provide the greatest profits to the firm. Figure 3 illustrates the metrics that embed the principles of CLV.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While most of the metrics illustrated in Figure 3 have been discussed in previous sections of this study, a brief description of salesperson future value (SFV), donor lifetime value (DLV), and employee engagement value (EEV) is provided here in the following subsections.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">SFV. Despite numerous studies conducted on the sales function, the future value of the salesperson to the firm and how organizational factors affect it has received little attention. Recognizing the importance of this knowledge to firms, Kumar, Sunder, and Leone (2014) conceptualized the SFV metric and empirically demonstrated the short-term and long-term effects of managing SFV. The SFV is defined as the NPV of future cash flows from a salesperson’s customers (i.e., CLV) after accounting for the costs of developing, motivating, and retaining the salesperson. By measuring the value of the salespeople using the SFV metric and linking the performance with the types of training and incentives each salesperson receives, it is possible to identify the best-performing salespeople and tailor the training and incentives to maximize their performance. When this approach was implemented in a Fortune 500 B2B firm, the firm was able to reallocate training and incentive investments across salespeople, which resulted in an 8% increase in SFV across the sales force and a 4% increase in firm revenue (Kumar, Sunder, and Leone 2015).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">DLV. Similar to for-profit firms, nonprofit firms also need to build relationships to be able to raise donations. In this case, the relationships are created with potential donors. Furthermore, the nonprofit firm will have to be selective about the donors with whom it builds relationships, so that it judiciously uses its limited resources. To make this possible, Kumar and Petersen (2016) conceptualized the DLV metric, which refers to the sum of donations in the future years discounted to the present value over a donor’s lifetime with the firm. Using the donor demographic information, past donation behavior, and marketing information, the DLV is modeled by predicting (<a id="bib1up

By computing the DLV, it is possible for nonprofit firms to rank-order donors on the basis of their future donation value to the firm. This metric can predict who will be able to donate with 90% accuracy, the value of donations with 80% accuracy, and the DLV with 75% accuracy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">EEV. Firms can leverage the power of an engaged customer base better if they have a workforce that interacts well with customers. Customer–employee interactions help create perceptions about the firm, which affect repeat customer purchases (Sirianni et al. 2013). These perceptions lead to attitudinal and behavioral outcomes through their impact on purchases, referrals, influence, and knowledge that the customers provide to the firm. In this regard, a positive interaction between customers and employees is likely to motivate how customers talk about the brand and whether they recommend it to their friends and relatives. Kumar and Pansari (2014, p. 55) define employee engagement as “a multidimensional construct which comprises of all the different facets of the attitudes and behaviors of employees towards the organization.” The dimensions of employee engagement comprise employee satisfaction, employee identification, employee commitment, employee loyalty, and employee performance. Kumar and Pansari (2016a) developed an approach to measure EEV using a five-point scale. When implemented in the airline, telecommunication, and hotel industries, the authors found that the highest level of growth in profits (10%–15%) occurs when a company’s employees are highly engaged (i.e., have a high EEV); the lowest level of growth (0%–1%) occurs when the company’s employees are disengaged (i.e., have a low EEV). Ongoing research continues to uncover several facets of the metrics presented in Figure 3, and the insights generated thus far have advised firms in valuing customers.</p><a id="AN0127019658-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-9" title="Nurturing Profitable Customers (Strategies)">Nurturing Profitable Customers (Strategies)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, the concepts and metrics discussed previously lead to the establishment of strategies that will aid in growing customer value. In developing strategies, firms are often misled by the belief that loyal customers are profitable. In addition, firms’ belief that creating customer reward programs can result in increased repeat purchasing behavior, and thereby improve firm profitability, is misplaced. Research in this area has shown that loyal customers are not necessarily profitable, and the relationship between repeat purchases and profitability is more complex than is often perceived. In addition, firms regularly use traditional metrics to measure the value of their customers, and these lead managers to implement flawed marketing strategies that drain the firm’s resources. In this regard, the CLV metric is ideal for firms aiming to grow and nurture customer profitability.

In effect, the study found that while there may be long-standing customers who are only marginally profitable, there also may be short-term customers who are highly profitable. The identification of the distinct customer types led to the development of the following specific strategies:</p><ol><li><span class="medium-normal"> High repeat purchases and high profitability. Referred to as “True Friends,” these customers buy steadily and regularly over time. They are generally satisfied with the firm and are usually comfortable engaging with the firm’s processes. Firms should build relationships with these customers because they present the highest potential for long-term profitability.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Low repeat purchases and high profitability. Referred to as “Butterflies,” these customers do not repeat purchase often, tend to buy a lot in a short time period and then move on to other firms, and avoid building a long-term relationship with any single firm. Firms should enjoy their profits until they turn to competition.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> High repeat purchases and low profitability. Referred to as “Barnacles,” these customers, if managed unwisely, could drain the company’s resources. Firms must evaluate their size and share of wallet. If the customers’ share of wallet is low, firms can up-sell and cross-sell to them to make them profitable. However, if the size of wallet is small, strict cost control measures must be taken to prevent losses for the firm.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Low repeat purchases and low profitability. Referred to as “Strangers,” these customers not only are a poor fit to the company but offer very little profit potential to the firm. Firms should identify these customers early on and avoid any investment toward building a relationship with them.</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A relationship focus would lead firms to identify those customers who provide the most value and prioritize the marketing efforts accordingly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Depth of Direct Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firms are expected to demonstrate the profitability of their marketing actions at the individual customer level on an ongoing basis. At the same time, customers expect firms to customize products and services to meet their demands. A successful management of these two types of expectations depends on the firms’ ability to better interact with customers and create a unique positioning in the future. This calls for implementing an interaction strategy in which firm–customer and customer–customer interactions constantly occur. In other words, the CVT advocates for a firm–customer exchange environment that focuses on constant interactions as opposed to just profitable transactions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Implementing the interaction strategy requires the firm to adopt an interaction-oriented approach, which consists of four components—customer concept, interaction response capacity, customer empowerment, and customer value management—that the firm can utilize to increase the impact on its profitability (Ramani and Kumar 2008). First, the customer concept proposes that the unit of every marketing action or reaction is an individual customer. This places the customer at the top of the hierarchy in the customer–firm relationship. By doing so, firms are able to observe customer behavior and respond appropriately.

Finally, the customer value management component refers to the extent to which a firm can quantify and calculate the individual customer value and use it to reallocate resources to customers. Firms such as IBM and American Express, through their endorsement of practices that are consistent with the elements of interaction orientation, have realized superior business performance, thereby demonstrating the managerial significance of the interaction orientation approach.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Breadth of Indirect Economic Value Contribution</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firms can nurture customer profitability by implementing an engagement strategy that considers the value generated by customers and employees and results in superior firm performance. The CVT proposes an engagement strategy that builds an engaged and committed customer and employee base to enhance the firm’s overall profitability (Kumar and Pansari 2016a).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although the engagement approach is powerful by itself, its true potential is realized when it is viewed from a long-term perspective. Engaged customers contribute to the long-term reputation and recognition of the brand. Creating an environment where customers are more engaged with the company may require an initial investment, but doing so has the potential to generate higher profits in the long run through the creation of customer engagement (Verhoef, Reinartz, and Krafft 2010). Furthermore, fostering engagement within firms is effective even in a recessionary economy. In a recessionary period, firms face budgetary challenges that significantly affect their marketing plans, which influences their levels of brand awareness and adoption. During this period, firms can mitigate the risks posed by the dents in their marketing budgets if they have a highly engaged employee base that promotes the firm’s brand and its products/services to its customers. This would ensure delivery of a superior customer experience, thereby increasing customer purchases, influence, and referrals—all without any additional marketing investments.</p><a id="AN0127019658-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-10" title="Benefits of the CVT">Benefits of the CVT</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The true measure of any marketing strategy or initiative is the improved financial result for the firm implementing it.

Using concepts from economics, finance, and marketing, this article has created an interface that connects the value of each customer (determined by evaluating the lifetime value of the customer to the firm) with the performance and, therefore, the valuation of the firm.

Furthermore, customers will be subjected to only the product/service offerings that are appropriate to them rather than every offering in the firm’s product portfolio. This keeps the customers focused, involved, and connected to the firm, thereby increasing their lifetime with the firm.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Benefit to the environment: When firms base their marketing actions on the potential value the customers can bring them, it becomes easier to align and allocate the optimal amount of resources toward each customer. For instance, firms can plan and optimize the printing and mailing of marketing materials only to those customers they are intended for, and not send mass mailers. In addition to enhancing the effectiveness of the firm’s marketing efforts, this would also prevent the wasteful usage of valuable environmental and infrastructural resources and would help firms embrace sustainability as part of their core mission (Kumar and Christodoulopoulou 2014).</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Benefit to society: The benefits to society from implementing the CVT are threefold. First, there is a clear line of communication from firms to customers in terms of what to expect. The customer expectations relate to product/service offerings as well as firm responses through marketing actions. Second, the customer’s repeat purchases can now be consolidated among a few preferred firms. When firms display their respective needs and expectations, customers’ repeat purchases gradually are aligned to matching firms. Over time, a self-selection of repeat patronage by firms takes place that leads firms to focus their resources to satisfy their customers’ expectations. Finally, customers become empowered, such that they can exercise their choice and free will, thereby having a definite say in the marketing transaction process. This empowerment is evident through behavior ranging from customer advocacy (in case of complete satisfaction of firm offerings) to customer boycott and negative word of mouth (in case of extreme displeasure).</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Benefit to the employees: Employees are instrumental in providing a better customer experience, and this leads to customer engagement. Firms can engage their customers only if their employees are committed to delivering the brand values and performing to the best of their ability. Employees can be committed to the organization only if they understand its goals and their responsibilities toward achieving these goals. The employees must be highly engaged with the firm to provide peak performance (Kumar and Pansari 2014). Therefore, in addition to engaging customers, firms must also ensure that they are engaging their employees.</span></li></ol><a id="AN0127019658-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019658-11" title="Implications for Future Research">Implications for Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The insights from various financial theories served as a good starting point in the development of the CVT. In addition, the modern portfolio theory provided insights into risk diversification and the maintenance of a balanced portfolio. Overall, this study has showcased CVT as a forward-looking approach to aid managers in the valuation and management of a customer’s future contributions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Specifically, two key managerial implications emerge. First, the applicability of the CVT has been demonstrated in various scenarios spanning multiple markets (e.g., B2B, B2C), business settings (e.g., contractual, noncontractual), regional contexts (e.g., domestic, global), and industries. This should provide confidence to managers regarding its relevance and applicability to the current marketplace. Furthermore, experts opine that in the next five to ten years, CLV will be the metric of prime importance to businesses (Fader 2016). Second, given the evolution in the methodology to value customers, the availability of customer information, and the 360-degree customer data, managers are enriched with improvements that can result in better implementation. Despite the success of the CLV metric, it has not experienced industry-wide acceptance. For instance, a survey found that while 76% of the respondents agreed that CLV was important to their organization, only 42% reported that they were able to implement it (Charlton 2014).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this light, I identify three areas that can benefit from future research. First, the identification of the relevant organizational structure required to facilitate and implement CVT-based strategies is important. A customer-centric organization has been identified as a basis to align an organization (Kumar 2013). Such an alignment can enable firms to view their customers both as a source of business and as a potential business resource. However, more insights are necessary to better understand the organizational requirements for a successful CVT implementation. Second, the role of multiple stakeholders needs to be explored. For instance, studies have investigated the circumstances in which firm–stakeholder relationships are forged, such as those in which (<a id="bib1up

However, precise recommendations have to be generated that can inform firms about better stakeholder integration for a successful implementation of CVT. Finally, the time-varying effects of certain drivers involved in the implementation of CVT need to be better understood. These elements include the valuation methodologies, data availability, intensity of customer-level data, and emergence of smarter consumers. Over time, these elements are likely to have a dynamic effect on CVT-based strategies. In summary, by focusing on a CVT-based approach, firms can (<a id="bib1up

Across two sets of studies, including a field study involving the launch of a new Coca-Cola product, the authors show that when food items are displayed in an aligned manner (i.e., when food items with lower-value calorie information are displayed below food items with higher calorie values), shoppers assign more importance weight to calorie gap information. In turn, higher importance weight assigned to calorie gap information leads diet-focused shoppers to relatively prefer low-calorie food items but leads taste-focused shoppers to relatively prefer higher-calorie food items. The third set of studies shows that this decision-making framework has widespread applicability and is relevant in any domain in which advertising, retail, and online displays show comparisons of numeric attribute information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In mid-2014, Coca-Cola launched Cola-Cola Life in Sweden, a reduced-calorie cola drink that differs from zero-calorie diet colas because it does not contain aspartame (which many perceive as unhealthy; Dean 2014). Reacting to an increased health focus among shoppers, launching Coca-Cola Life was part of Coca-Cola’s efforts to reduce the average calorie content of its drinks portfolio while still avoiding the use of aspartame. Some months prior to the launch, one of the authors of this article was in discussions with Coca-Cola managers about which factors were likely to influence shoppers’ choices between regular Coke and Coca-Cola Life. One factor discussed was in-store signage. Would signage indicating that Coca-Cola Life has lower calorie content be effective, despite prior research showing that merely indicating calorie values does not automatically lead shoppers to make healthier choices (Loewenstein 2011; see also Haws, Davis, and Dholakia 2016). This article was motivated, in part, by these discussions and the real-world challenges the authors (and firms like Coca-Cola) aim to examine.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To better understand the factors that influence the choice of healthier food items, we start with the foundational notion that shoppers’ food choices depend on both individual differences among shoppers and the presentation format for the nutritional information (Haws, Davis, and Dholakia 2016; Loewenstein 2011; Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski 2012). Most prior work has focused on evaluations of single food items (e.g., Gomez, Werle, and Corneille 2017; Graham and Mohr 2014; Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski 2012); in contrast, in this article, we consider how shoppers choose among multiple food items, which represents a normative shopping situation. For example, shoppers often choose among various entrees in restaurants, multiple soup cans in supermarkets, or numerous soft drinks in convenience stores.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We focus on two specific drivers of food item choice. We start by examining shoppers’ goals, which may be conceptualized as either individual differences or differences primed by the product category or shopping environment (e.g., Escaron et al. 2013; Newman, Howlett, and Burton 2014). A significant amount of prior research has highlighted goals related to dietary restraint, that is, the extent to which shoppers have diet goals which leads them to prefer food items with fewer calories1 (Howlett et al. 2012; Visschers, Hess, and Siegrist 2010) and consume fewer calories (Cavanagh and Forestell 2013). In this article, we offer a different proposal, making two points. First, rather than posit that shoppers are more or less focused on diet goals, we posit that shoppers focus on diet goals versus taste goals. Second, building from work on the “unhealthy = tasty” intuition (Raghunathan, Naylor, and Hoyer 2006), we argue that tastefocused shoppers intuit that unhealthy food items will better satisfy their taste goals, so their choice decisions appear to favor food items with more calories. Thus, we take a different perspective than prior work, and so we contrast shoppers with diet goals versus taste goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, in grocery store settings, choices often involve a comparison between a focal, healthy food item and a comparison food item (Suri et al. 2012); in response, food manufacturers often provide comparisons that highlight the “nutritional gap.” For example, Better’n Peanut Butter Banana spread advertises that it has “40% fewer calories,” and Trop50 orange juice proclaims that it has “50% less sugar and calories,” relative to comparable products. However, in many cases, only calorie information appears in the front-of-pack (FOP) information, so shoppers must perform calorie gap calculations themselves. In turn, building on work in numeric cognition (e.g., Biswas et al. 2013) and heuristics (e.g., Shah and Oppenheimer 2007), we propose that differences in the vertical display of food items could prompt differences in perceptions of the importance of the calorie gap. If a focal food item, with fewer calories, appears below another food item (i.e., if the focal food item is displayed in an aligned manner), then the subtraction task to calculate the calorie gap is easier. And if calculating the calorie gap is easier, then shoppers are likely to attach more importance to calorie gap information during their evaluations. Thus, displaying a focal food item in an aligned manner should increase the importance weight that shoppers place on the calorie gap. Among shoppers with diet goals, this increased importance weight shifts shoppers’ choices toward the focal food item, but among tastefocused shoppers, this increased importance weight may shift the choice share away from the focal food item, toward the higher-calorie option. By combining these propositions, we posit that when food items are displayed in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner, diet-focused shoppers relatively prefer lower-calorie food items, but taste-focused shoppers make choices as if they relatively prefer higher-calorie food items. This nonintuitive proposition is the central hypothesis of our article, and we test it across multiple studies, including a field study involving the choice between regular Coca-Cola and the lower-calorie Coca-Cola Life.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More generally, in this article we focus on product domains for which advertising, retail, and online displays show comparisons of numeric attribute information. The food domain is one such domain, which involves comparisons of numeric nutritional information relating to calories (and sodium).

First, numeric attribute information may be displayed in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner, whereby aligned display involves showing the low-value numeric information below the higher-value numeric information (e.g., lower prices displayed below higher prices). Second, shoppers may have different goals, perceiving attributes as either more-is-better (MIB; preferring items with higher attribute values) or less-is-better (LIB; preferring items with lower attribute values). For example, shoppers who view price as a measure of sacrifice perceive price as an LIB attribute, whereas those who view price as a measure of quality perceive price as an MIB attribute (Dodds, Monroe, and Grewal 1991; see also Miyazaki, Grewal, and Goodstein 2005). In the domain of robotic vacuum cleaners, operating time is an MIB attribute, but charging time is an LIB attribute; in the domain of laptops, many would perceive battery life as an MIB attribute but perceive laptop weight as an LIB attribute. Building from the central hypothesis outlined previously, we posit that when items are displayed in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner, shoppers who perceive the displayed attribute as an LIB (MIB) attribute will relatively prefer the item with the lower (higher) value attribute.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We aim to make the following contributions.

We suggest that firms can use this framework to better design advertising, retail, and online displays. While Biswas et al. (2013; work on the subtraction principle) provide an initial examination of aligned (vs. nonaligned) displays, their stated process mechanism does not easily extend beyond the price promotion domain and was examined only in LIB contexts. The current article substantially modifies and broadens the process mechanism underlying the subtraction principle to allow it to extend into multiple product domains. Moreover, we explicitly contrast LIB versus MIB contexts, outlining exactly how shoppers’ attribute perceptions (i.e., LIB vs. MIB) and display alignment jointly influence their choices and perceptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we aim to make two contributions specific to the food domain. Not only is the food domain important from both a firm perspective and a shopper perspective, but also the growing importance of how best to motivate people to make healthy food choices has prompted increased research focus in this domain. First, prior research suggests that people who have less focus on diet goals pay less attention to calorie information (e.g., Bialkova, Sasse, and Fenko 2016; Cavanagh and Forestell 2013; Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski 2012). In contrast, we show that people who have less focus on diet goals (i.e., have more focus on taste goals) indeed pay attention to calorie information (similar to people with more focus on diet goals), but because of the unhealthy = tasty intuition, these shoppers behave as if they prefer food items with more calories (unlike people with more focus on diet goals). Second, as a novel point not evidenced in prior research, we show that whether shoppers make goal-consistent choices is contingent on whether food items are displayed in an aligned manner. Next, we develop our propositions and test them across multiple product domains, including in a field study involving the choice between regular Coca-Cola and the newly launched, low-calorie Coca-Cola Life.</p><a id="AN0128990189-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990189-2" title="Conceptual Development">Conceptual Development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shoppers’ Goals During Food Item Choices</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">What goals do shoppers have when they make food item choices? To answer this question, we turn to literature at the intersection of food-related research and research into goals. On the one hand, there may be individual differences (i.e., “trait differences”) across shoppers, and these differences should lead to shoppers having different goals when making food item choices. Specifically, some shoppers have diet goals (Herman and Polivy 2004; Howlett et al. 2012; Naylor, Droms, and Haws 2009), so they prefer food items with fewer calories or less sodium (LIB behavior).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has examined the extent to which shoppers focus on diet goals (Haws, Davis, and Dholakia 2016; Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski 2012; Naylor, Droms, and Haws 2009; Van Herpen and Van Trijp 2011), and the subsequent impact on food item choices and consumption. This prior research has indicated that people who have less focus on diet goals tend to pay less attention to nutritional information. Thus, Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski (2012; p. 66) show that when presented with less healthy versus more healthy food items, people with higher levels of dietary concerns were significantly more likely to choose the healthier food item, but people with low levels of dietary concerns were relatively indifferent across food items (“significantly higher purchase intentions … for all values of dietary concern above 3.80” vs. “no significant differences below … the Johnson–Neyman point”). Similarly, Cavanagh and Forestell (2013; p. 508) found that restrained eaters consumed more (relatively healthy) Kashi cookies than Nabisco cookies, “whereas the unrestrained eaters did not differ in their consumption of the two brands,” Finally, Bialkova, Sasse, and Fenko (2016; p. 44) asked participants to choose between (relatively healthy) cereal bars and (relatively unhealthy) potato chips. They found that “consumers highly concerned about health preferred to buy cereal bars ( p = .018), while less concerned consumers selected to buy chips and cereals with equal probability ( p &gt; .4).” Taken together, these findings appear to indicate that people with low levels of dietary concerns are relatively indifferent between the less healthy food item and the healthier food item. In this article, however, we posit differently, and so we make two distinct points.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shoppers’ goals. Rather than describing shoppers’ goals on a continuum anchored by more versus less focus on diet goals, in this article we propose that the relevant anchors should be diet goals versus taste goals. As a novel point, we emphasize the explicit presence of taste goals (and not just less focus on diet goals), consistent with Andrews, Netemeyer, and Burton’s (1998) use of a taste goal prime as a control condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior literature has indicated that shoppers with more focus on diet goals pay attention to nutrition information (“consumers who expressed a great concern for … dietary eating … made more active use of the health label information”; Bialkova, Sasse, and Fenko 2016, p. 40), and so are more likely to prefer food items with fewer calories. However, distinct from prior literature, we propose that shoppers with less focus on diet goals (i.e., those with taste goals) also pay attention to nutrition information but use it differently, such that they choose food items with more calories. We clarify that we are not claiming that shoppers with taste goals deliberately seek out food items with more calories; rather, we suggest that these shoppers intuit that high-calorie food items are tastier (unhealthy = tasty intuition); in their quest for taste, they select relatively highercalorie food items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To make this prediction, we build from research into behavioral traits (related to food preferences, and related to impulsivity) and perceptions of food. First, we build from work that connects dietary restraint to impulsiveness. The work of Van Koningsbruggen, Stroebe, and Aarts (2013; Table 1; p. 83) indicates that those low on dietary restraint are more likely to be impulsive. Second, more impulsive people are likely to prefer tasty food, and they are both more likely to pick up (tasty) cookies (Ramanathan and Menon 2006; Figure 3, p. 638) and more likely to choose (tasty) cake over salad (Sengupta and Zhou 2007; Study 2, p. 301). Third, unhealthy foods are more likely to be perceived as tasty (see work on the unhealthy = tasty intuition2 [Mai and Hoffmann 2015; Raghunathan, Naylor, and Hoyer 2006). Overall, we posit that people low on dietary restraint (i.e., those with taste goals) may behave as if they prefer (relatively) unhealthy food items.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Individual differences versus state differences. Beyond just individual differences (e.g., extent of diet intentions), environmental factors may also prompt differences in (diet vs. taste) goals, which we term “state differences.” Product category differences may trigger differences in goals, with shopping for health-focused foods potentially triggering diet goals and shopping for candy potentially triggering taste goals. Advertising differences may also prompt differences in goals. Foods advertised as health foods or diet foods, or foods packaged reflecting “greenness” may trigger diet goals, whereas foods advertised as comfort foods may prompt taste goals. Thus, it is possible that the same person may have diet goals when examining a certain type of food item and yet may have taste goals when examining a different type of food item.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These discussions suggest that those with diet goals should prefer lower calorie food items, whereas those with taste goals should (in line with the unhealthy = tasty intuition) behave as if they seek out higher-calorie food items. Next, we propose that differences in how food items are displayed affect the extent to which shoppers’ goals influence food item preferences, and we elaborate on this point in the following subsection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/149n1.jpg" alt="149n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 1 Johnson–Neyman Regions in Study 1"><em>TABLE: TABLE 1 Johnson–Neyman Regions in Study 1</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Diet Scalea</th><th valign="top">Effect</th><th valign="top">SE</th><th valign="top">z</th><th valign="top">p-Value</th><th valign="top">LLCI</th><th valign="top">ULCI</th><th valign="top">Participant Behavior Consistent with:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">-1.3100</td><td valign="top">-.5238</td><td valign="top">.1939</td><td valign="top">-2.7014</td><td valign="top">.0069</td><td valign="top">-.9038</td><td valign="top">-.1438</td><td valign="top">Taste goals (30.11% of sample)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-.4310</td><td valign="top">-.2416</td><td valign="top">.1233</td><td valign="top">-1.9600</td><td valign="top">.0500</td><td valign="top">-.4833</td><td valign="top">.0000</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-.3100</td><td valign="top">-.2028</td><td valign="top">.1175</td><td valign="top">-1.7262</td><td valign="top">.0843</td><td valign="top">-.4331</td><td valign="top">.0275</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">.6900</td><td valign="top">.1182</td><td valign="top">.1337</td><td valign="top">.8836</td><td valign="top">.3769</td><td valign="top">-.1439</td><td valign="top">.3802</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1.6765</td><td valign="top">.4348</td><td valign="top">.2218</td><td valign="top">1.9600</td><td valign="top">.0500</td><td valign="top">.0000</td><td valign="top">.8696</td><td valign="top">Diet goals (7.95% of sample)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1.6900</td><td valign="top">.4391</td><td valign="top">.2232</td><td valign="top">1.9672</td><td valign="top">.0492</td><td valign="top">.0016</td><td valign="top">.8766</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.6900</td><td valign="top">.7601</td><td valign="top">.3311</td><td valign="top">2.2955</td><td valign="top">.0217</td><td valign="top">.1111</td><td valign="top">1.4090</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">aMean-centered values for diet intentions scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Notes: This table illustrates the conditional effect of alignment on choice of Coca-Cola Life, at values of diet intentions scale.

In many cases, nutritional information is available FOP, so shoppers can calculate the attribute gap (e.g., calorie gap, sodium content gap). For example, a grocery shopper aiming to buy cereal may find a focal food item, which has fewer calories, displayed either below or above a higher-calorie food item. Both food items display calorie content FOP. If the propensity to engage in calorie gap calculations depends on whether the food items are presented in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) display, then such display differences may influence food item choice. We first consider whether differences in the display format influence shoppers’ propensity to initiate a subtraction task to calculate the calorie gap, then we discuss how this propensity might influence the importance weight shoppers attach to the calorie gap for their evaluations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Impact on propensity to initiate the subtraction task. In general, a comparison of two attributes that feature numeric information involves subtraction (Thomas and Morwitz 2009). However, prior research has not fully explored how presenting a smaller number below versus above a larger number influences subtraction calculations. We integrate research in numeric cognition with pricing research to examine this question. First, in the subtraction task A - B, A is the minuend, and B is the subtrahend. People generally perceive that it is normative to present a larger minuend above a smaller subtrahend, and prior research has affirmed that fewer computational errors occur with this format (Fuson and Briars 1990). Second, in a study of how people verify addition problems, Yip (2002) finds that inaccurate equations that fail to conform to conventional presentation norms are perceived as harder to verify as correct (e.g., it is more difficult to determine whether 7 = 3 + 5 is correct than whether 3 + 5 = 7 is correct). Accordingly, we posit that subtraction equations in which a smaller-value subtrahend appears below (above) the minuend are easier (harder) to verify. Third, because people do not like to work on overly challenging problems (Oppenheimer 2008), locating a smaller-value subtrahend above the minuend—contrary to the norm in contexts involving difference calculations—may reduce the propensity to perform a subtraction task. In research on price promotions, Biswas et al. (2013) propose the subtraction principle, a somewhat similar information processing sequence. They proposed that when sale prices are displayed to the right of the original price (i.e., smaller number to right of the larger number), shoppers perceive the subtraction task as cognitively easier and so are more likely to calculate the discount depth. However, if sale prices appear to the left of the original price, shoppers perceive the subtraction task as cognitively harder and so are less likely to initiate a subtraction task. Rather, shoppers would approximate discount depth at around 10%–12% (reflecting a discount depth benchmark from Blair and Landon [1981]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Now assume that two (competing) cereals explicitly provide FOP calorie information. Building on the previous arguments, if the focal, healthy cereal is displayed in an aligned manner, then shoppers can calculate the calorie difference relatively easily. But if the focal cereal is displayed in a nonaligned manner, shoppers may perceive the subtraction task as harder and so may be less likely to initiate the subtraction task to calculate the calorie gap.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importance weight attached to the calorie gap during evaluations. During evaluations, people grant easy-to-process cues higher importance weights (Shah and Oppenheimer 2007, pp. 371–72; see also Oppenheimer 2008). This point has roots in prior work on heuristics, which shows that people more heavily weight easier-to-access cues. For instance, people use brand name perceptions as proxy for product quality (Maheswaran, Mackie, and Chaiken 1992), use ease-ofimageability of attributes (like hallways) as an input for making apartment evaluations (Keller and McGill 1994), and so on. Therefore, if shoppers perceive that calculating the calorie gap is relatively easier, during evaluations they assign more importance weight to the calorie gap. Continuing with the cereal example, if the focal, low-calorie cereal is displayed in an aligned manner, during evaluations shoppers attach relatively higher importance weight to calorie gap information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This mechanism substantially enhances the generalizability of the subtraction principle mechanism proposed in Biswas et al. (2013). The subtraction principle predicts that displaying the sale price in a nonaligned manner increases subtraction difficulty. In turn, due to subtraction difficulty, shoppers who are less likely to initiate the subtraction task to calculate discount depth assume a 10%–12% discount depth (benchmark from Blair and Landon 1981). This mechanism, especially the point about the assumed discount depth, is fairly specific to the pricing domain. We modify the subtraction principle mechanism and propose that shoppers who are more (less) likely to initiate the subtraction task attach more (less) importance weight to discount depth information (more generally, attribute gap information). Consequent to this modification, the subtraction principle can apply beyond the pricing domain to a wide variety of other product domains.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, the studies in Biswas et al. (2013) focus exclusively on the domain of price promotions and imply that shoppers generally prefer an overall lower price, in effect implying that price is an LIB attribute. We point out that there are contexts wherein price may be perceived as an MIB attribute, often for reasons relating to signaling of quality (Dodds, Monroe, and Grewal 1991; Miyazaki, Grewal, and Goodstein 2005; Monroe 1973). In this article, we generalize the work of Biswas et al. (2013), examining both LIB and MIB attributes, while also examining attributes such as calories, which are perceived by some as LIB and perceived by others as MIB. Appendix A lists the aforementioned points and shows the various ways this research modifies and broadens the prior conceptualization of the subtraction principle.</p><a id="AN0128990189-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990189-5" title="Setting Up the Hypotheses">Setting Up the Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Displaying a focal, healthy food item in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner should increase the perceived importance weight of the calorie gap during evaluations.

We had access to endcap shelving, which we modified using two different display versions that alternated every few hours, displaying CCL in either an aligned manner (i.e., CCR on the shelf above and CCL on the shelf below) or a nonaligned manner.

Moving beyond traits, in Study 2a we acknowledge that shoppers may differ in their (taste vs. diet) goals, contingent on the food item category. That is, the same shopper could have different goals, conditional on differences between food item categories. Some sets of food items (e.g., health foods) may prompt diet goals, but others (e.g., desserts) may be associated with taste goals. To the extent that products prompt different goals, the effects of presenting food items using an aligned (vs. nonaligned) display may differ. To examine this point, in Study 2a we prime participants to associate the same product (in this case, chocolates) with either a taste goal or a diet goal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Method. This was a 2 (goal association: taste goal vs. diet goal) · 2 (display: aligned vs. nonaligned) between-subjects design, involving 255 undergraduate students (65.1% women) taking a survey in a behavioral lab. Participants were told that the survey was about beliefs and preferences about chocolate. First, we primed chocolate as being associated with either a taste goal or a diet goal, using a mechanism outlined in prior work (e.g., Dhar and Wertenbroch 2000; Roggeveen et al. 2015). For the taste goal, participants were told that “there are many reasons why people eat chocolate. And yet, what is often comes down to, is that people eat chocolate because it makes them happy. At the end of a long day, eating a piece of chocolate is the perfect reward.” Next, participants were asked to write a few words about why people should eat chocolate. Participants generally responded in ways consistent with a taste goal (e.g., “People should eat chocolate because it makes them happy. It feels rewarding to have some at the end of a day,” “It’s a wellearned reward at the end of a long day,” “Eating chocolates make people happy. They think [it’s the] perfect reward”). For the diet goal, participants were told that “there are many reasons why people eat chocolate. Interestingly—and this may not be well known—people should eat chocolate for health reasons. Medical studies have shown that chocolate can not only reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL (good cholesterol) but also reduce the incidence of stroke. Next, participants were asked to write a few words about why people should eat chocolate. Participants generally responded in ways consistent with a diet goal (e.g., “It is good for your cholesterol and can prevent strokes,” “People should eat chocolate because it can improve aspects of your health,” “reduce LDL/increase HDL/reduce chance of a stroke”).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, participants were shown two chocolate boxes.

First, as part of a set of multiple studies, participants filled out the short, five-point (1 = “never,” and 5 = “always”), sixitem diet intentions scale (Stice 1998; a = .91). The six items were “I take small helpings in an effort to control my weight,” “I limit the amount of food I eat in an effort to control my weight,” “I hold back at meals in an attempt to prevent weight gain,” “I sometimes avoid eating in an attempt to control my weight,” “I skip meals in an effort to control my weight,” and “I sometimes eat only one or two meals a day to try to limit my weight.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, a week later, the same undergraduate students participated in a soup choice study. Because the popular press tends to highlight the negative influences of sodium on health, we did not expect many participants to know that higher sodium (also) can be associated with better taste.

Among those who scored high on the diet intentions scale, participants who assigned more weight to the sodium content should be more likely to choose lowsodium can N. However, if participants scored low on the diet intentions scale, such that they likely focus more on taste, then those who placed more weight on sodium content should be more likely to choose higher-sodium can B (due to the unhealthy = tasty intuition) and so should be less likely to choose can N and more likely to choose can B.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results. First, we ran a logistic regression for soup choice (can B = 0, can N = 1), in which the independent variables were the diet intentions score (mean-centered at M = 2.21) and display (not aligned = –1, aligned = 1). The main effect of meancentered diet intentions score was significant (b = .77, SE = .18, z = 4.34, p &lt; .05), the main effect of the vertical display was not significant (z = .30, p = .76) and the interaction effect was significant (b = .69, SE = .18, z = 3.86, p &lt; .05). The positive interaction term indicated that those with higher diet intention scores were more likely to choose the low-sodium soup can in the aligned display condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, the floodlight analysis (PROCESS Model 1) depicted in Table 2 revealed that for those with mean-centered diet intention scores greater than .36 (34.9% of sample), soup can N was relatively more preferred in the aligned display condition (at score of .36; b = .29, SE = .14, z = 1.96, p = .05).

Thus, if participants scored higher on the diet intentions scale (i.e., had diet goals) and placed more importance weight on sodium during the choice process, they were more likely to choose can N. But for participants with mean-centered diet intention scale scores less than –.87 (i.e., with scores 1 SD below the mean diet intentions scale score), the PROCESS (Model 14) output indicated that the mediating effect of the importance weight for sodium was significantly negative (95% confidence interval = [–.57, –.01]). Thus, if participants scored lower on the diet intentions scale (i.e., had taste goals) and placed more importance weight on sodium during the choice process, they were less likely to choose lower-sodium can N and more likely to choose the higher-sodium can B.

In Study 3b, we examined the specific case of when difference calculations were easy (e.g., 350 - 250), and thus, alignment differences should not influence the importance weight that shoppers would generally give to the difference gap. Other instances when difference calculations should be easier may include when, for example, the difference gap is explicitly stated (e.g., the difference percentage is explicitly shown [“40% more battery life,” “25% less sodium”]) or the difference is very large. In all these cases, there would be no need for the shopper to perform the difference calculations to figure out that the difference gap is substantial, so shoppers should generally give the difference gap relatively high importance weight. These factors—some of which were foreshadowed in Biswas et al. (2013)—all (potentially) constitute moderators to our effects.</p><a id="AN0128990189-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990189-17" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For shoppers who have diet goals, presenting a focal, healthy food item in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner increases its choice share.

This nonintuitive interaction result reflects our central hypothesis (H1), whereby the extent to which shoppers make made goal-consistent food item choices is higher (lower) when the food items are displayed in an aligned (nonaligned) manner. Drawing on work in food-related research, goals, and numeric cognition, we outline the underlying process mechanism in H2–H3.

First, prior research has suggested that people with less focus on diet goals pay less attention to nutrition information (Naylor, Droms, and Haws 2009; Van Herpen and Van Trijp 2011). For example, Mohr, Lichtenstein, and Janiszewski (2012, p. 64) argue that “those very involved with their dietary choices will … [be influenced by] nutrition labels,” and they found (p. 66) that differences in purchase intentions across less healthy versus healthier food items arose among those with higher levels of diet intentions but not among those with lower levels of diet intentions. Bialkova, Sasse, and Fenko (2016) and Cavanagh and Forestell (2013) found similar effects, such that people who were more concerned about health were more likely to prefer healthy food items over less healthy food items, but people less concerned about health expressed no clear preference. In contrast, we propose that people with less focus on diet goals (i.e., those with taste goals) do indeed pay attention to nutrition labels; however, because of the unhealthy = tasty intuition, these shoppers behave as if they prefer food items with more calories or sodium. This explanation better reflects the interaction result in Studies 1–2, implying a specific disordinal (crossover) pattern. If shoppers with taste goals merely ignored (or paid less attention to) nutrition information, the interaction pattern in Studies 1–2 would be different and would reflect an ordinal pattern. In contrast with prior research, we find that it is possible to find cases wherein those score lower on the diet intentions scale behave as if they may prefer higher-calorie food items—especially when attribute information is presented in an aligned manner. This point highlights a key contribution of this article.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, prior research into shoppers’ food choices has tended to ignore the impact of display differences (and other contextual differences) related to the presentation of calorie information. Specifically, even as prior research posits that people with diet goals focus more on low-calorie items, it ignores the possibility that these effects may be weaker if lowercalorie food items are displayed in a nonaligned manner. In Studies 1 and 2, the effect of diet intention scores (or diet vs. taste primes in Study 2a) on choices and preferences is moderated by differences in attribute display. In essence, shoppers are more likely to make goal-consistent choices when food items are displayed in an aligned manner. This point is both new and nontrivial. Beyond the implications for practice (as we discuss subsequently), this finding may explain null results that arise when differences in diet intentions do not prompt different choices or preferences. For example, consider Study 2b. We reanalyze the data and, purely for illustrative purposes, median-split the diet intentions variable. If we consider just the two cells reflecting the nonaligned display condition, the relative choice shares for the low-sodium soup can were 39.7% (low diet intentions) versus 43.1% (high diet intentions) (c2(<a id="bib1up

Examining just these cells might lead a researcher to conclude that differences in diet intentions do not affect shoppers’ choices. Yet when we consider the other two cells, which involve aligned food item displays, the relative choice shares shift to 22.2% (low diet intentions) versus 70.7% (high diet intentions) (c2(<a id="bib1up

Thus, examining just the data pertaining to an aligned display would lead a researcher to a very different conclusion: that differences in diet intentions significantly affect shoppers’ choices. Both points are contributions beyond modifying and broadening the subtraction principle and are highlighted as such in Appendix A.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The findings in this article also contribute to the numerical cognition literature. By examining the impact of display differences, we determine that vertical display differences lead to varying importance weights that shoppers assign to the attribute gap when making evaluations. Displaying a focal food item in an aligned (vs. nonaligned) manner, such as below (vs. above) comparison food items, leads shoppers to attach more importance weight to the attribute gap in their evaluations. We tested these effects not only within the food domain (Studies 1 and 2) but also in other domains (Study 3), indicating that these effects have predictive applicability across a wide variety of domains wherein advertising, retail displays, and online displays involve comparisons of numeric attribute information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given concerns about obesity and associated health problems (Howlett et al. 2012), there is much interest in understanding when shoppers might use calorie and sodium information to make healthier choices. One challenge is to motivate shoppers to embrace diet goals, which can increase their consumption of healthier foods. However, assuming shoppers have diet goals, another challenge is to ensure that available calorie (or sodium content) information is displayed in ways that nudge shoppers toward healthier, rather than less healthy, food choices. Our findings suggest that display differences related to the location of food items can encourage shoppers’ healthy choices. As our studies indicate, diet-focused shoppers are more likely to make healthy choices if nutrition information is displayed in an aligned manner.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, and most importantly, this article outlines a parsimonious decision-making framework that examines how shoppers react to advertising, retail, or online displays in a wide variety of product domains involving comparisons of numeric attribute information. Building from, modifying, and expanding the work in Biswas et al. (2013), we identify two key elements that jointly determine shoppers’ evaluations: (<a id="bib1up

Firms can use this framework to better design advertising, retail displays, and online displays.

As more firms adopt the voluntary FOP nutrition labeling system, “Facts Up Front,” and as more retailers display food items to showcase such FOP information, a key question is how retailers and category captains should organize the display of food items on retail shelves. The insights in this article offer some guidance. Imagine a retailer that wants to promote the new low-calorie Coca-Cola Life soft drink. If most shoppers (at this retailer) have diet goals, or if the retailer is able to prime diet goals through in-store signage or advertising, then, on the basis of this research, the retailer will increase sales by putting cans of Coca-Cola Life below cans of regular Coca-Cola. If a retailer primarily attracts shoppers with diet goals, but its profit margins are better on regular soups, then it might choose to put the regular soup cans below the lower-sodium soup cans to encourage relatively more sales of regular soup, despite its primarily “diet-goal” shopper segment. Finally, depending on food item categories, advertising, packaging, and so on, shoppers may have different goals. To the extent a retailer knows these goals, or to the extent firms can use advertising or packaging to prime such goals, firms can use display differences to increase sales of the more profitable products within the category. For example, if the candy category prompts taste goals, and if margins are higher on candy products with more calories, then retailers should display higher-calorie candy items above other candy-items to maximize sales of these more profitable products. Thus, the findings in this article can aid retailers and category captains as they optimize in-store shelf displays. Contingent on shoppers’ goals, numeric values relating to calorie content or to sodium, and relative food item profitability, retailers can display food items in ways that “push” certain high-profit food items over others. Similarly, the findings in this article may also inform how online retailers should display food items on their webpages and how supermarkets and grocery items should display food items on flyers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The effects we describe herein are driven by differences in (locational) displays of food items, which lead to differences in importance weight attached to food item attributes, with downstream consequences. Understanding this informationprocessing sequence has several implications for consumer welfare and public policy. First, we provide guidance for how diet and nutrition apps might be structured to help shoppers make healthy choices, noting that those who use such apps likely already have diet goals. When diet apps provide scores of food items, whether in grocery stores or restaurants, such diet apps should motivate shoppers to not only learn exact calorie/sodium information but also to give this information greater importance weight in their evaluations. Such efforts might help mitigate any negative impact arising from retailers’ use of nonaligned displays. Second, from a public policy perspective, young consumers and children are relatively unlikely to have diet goals (Burton, Wang, and Worsley 2015), and so using aligned food item displays may well backfire. Specifically, using aligned food item displays and/or explicitly prompting younger consumers to consider calorie/sodium information is likely to increase their preference shift toward higher-calorie/sodium food items. In such instances, regulatory policies governing advertising and menu signage should (seemingly counterintuitively) recommend using nonaligned display presentations and should (seemingly counterintuitively, but importantly) avoid prompting younger consumers to explicitly consider calorie/sodium information. These points highlight the role of attribute gap importance weight and distinguish this work from Biswas et al. (2013). Finally, both shoppers and policy makers need to recognize that marketers can present attribute information in ways that may mislead shoppers. For example, if a lower-calorie option involves smaller profit margins, a restaurant frequented by patrons with diet goals might display this option above a high-calorie option to reduce patrons’ weighting of the calorie gap and thus reduce patrons’ preference shift toward the lower-calorie option. Such a practice can be labeled as “providing full information” to patrons and is not illegal, but public policy experts would note that it may reduce welfare.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The effects outlined in this article have widespread applicability, extending well beyond the food domain. As stated previously, these effects apply to any product domain involving a comparison of numeric attributes. Thus, for example, the effects would extend to any product domain wherein prices (typically an LIB domain) are displayed; into any domain involving MIB attributes such as battery life (e.g., cell phones, tablets, laptops) and Internet speed (e.g., cellular networks); and into domains such as robotic vacuum cleaners, which involve attributes that are MIB (e.g., operating time) and LIB (charging time).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a specific example, some insurance companies (e.g., Progressive) provide information both about their own rates and about the rate from a competitor. Progressive shoppers would behave similarly to shoppers with diet goals, in the sense that insurance shoppers generally prefer lower insurance rates (insurance rates = LIB attribute). In line with this article’s findings, we suggest that an insurance provider should present its own rate quote below the quote from a competitor. If its own rates are lower, this presentation format ensures that insurance shoppers put more weight on the “rate gap,” which increases relative preference for the focal insurance company’s product. If, however, the competitor’s rates are lower, presenting its own (higheramount) rates below would lead shoppers to put less weight on the rate gap, thus decreasing relative preference for the competitor’s insurance product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The advice in the previous paragraph is valid when the attributes involved are clearly LIB. However, other attributes may typically be perceived as MIB (e.g., network speed, battery life, operating time [in robotic vacuum cleaners]). In such instances, the focal firm should display its information above that of competition (exactly opposite of what is advised when the attribute is LIB). If its competitor’s “scores” are lower, this presentation display ensures that shoppers put more weight on the attribute gap, which increases relative preference for the focal firm’s product. If its competitor’s scores are higher, then this presentation display leads shoppers to put less weight on the attribute gap, thus decreasing relative preference for the competitor’s product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The contrast across the prior two paragraphs highlights the importance of identifying shoppers’ goals and identifying whether shoppers perceive the attribute as LIB or MIB. As we have noted, what constitutes the optimal display is conditional on how shoppers perceive attributes. It is for this reason that LIB versus MIB is one of the two independent variables in this article.</p><a id="AN0128990189-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0128990189-20" title="Limitations and Future Research">Limitations and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The effects we find are driven by differences in displays of food items, which lead to varying importance weights assigned to numeric attribute information and further downstream consequences. We reiterate this important point because it helps clarify the conditions in which the effects we propose may be more versus less evident. To the extent that the effects in this article are driven by differences in importance weights, they may be more evident if the importance weight of numeric attribute information (e.g., calories, sodium, price) is neither too high nor too low. However, in certain conditions, such importance might reach high levels, and it is then that the effects we propose may be less evident. For example, if calorie attributes dominate choice (i.e., have very high importance weight), display differences likely have minimal effects, as a result of ceiling effects. Beyond the moderators identified in</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 3b, these may also constitute moderators of our effects, and these are not predicted by Biswas et al. (2013).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future research could also further examine the informationprocessing mechanism outlined in H2 and H3. A key element of this mechanism is that subtraction calculations are perceived as more difficult when the smaller number is displayed above the larger number. Numerical cognition researchers may also examine whether individual differences related to numeracy, math anxiety, and so on may moderate the effects noted in H2–H3.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, there are two ways shoppers can perceive numeric attributes (vector attributes vs. ideal point attributes; see Green and Srinivasan 1978; Teas 1993). This article examines the case wherein shoppers perceive attributes as “vector” attributes, preferring either more of an attribute (MIB [e.g., battery life]) or less of an attribute (LIB [e.g., for diet focused shoppers, fewer calories/less sodium), but it does not examine what happens when attributes have ideal point characteristics. What happens if shoppers believe that an “ideal” number of calories for a sandwich is around 350 calories? Future research could explore whether the effects in this article sustain when such ideal points exist for key attributes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this research, we assume that consumers who behave as if they prefer food items with more calories do so for taste-related reasons. But other reasons could also be operant, such as financial reasons that prompt some lower-income shoppers to prefer food items with more calories. Examining the behaviors of these shoppers is an important area for research, especially from a policy standpoint, to determine whether lower-income shoppers might prioritize calorie amounts over factors like nutrition or health.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on a “healthy-left, unhealthy-right” intuition, Romero and Biswas (2016) propose that a food item without nutrition labeling is perceived as healthier if displayed to the left (vs. right) of a comparison food item. Among shoppers with diet goals, such a display increases the focal, healthy food item’s choice share. However, we propose that when FOP calorie information is shown, displaying the focal, healthy food item to the right of the comparison item (i.e., displaying the food items in an aligned display) may increase the importance weight that shoppers attach to the calorie gap during their evaluations and so would increase the choice share of this food item. Thus, presence of FOP calorie information may reverse Romero and Biswas’s (2016) results. Research that tests these competing predictions could contribute to both theory and practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Implicit in our theory is that many shoppers embrace the unhealthy = tasty intuition. It would be worthwhile to reexamine these effects among populations (e.g., in France; see Werle, Trendel, and Ardito 2013) for whom this intuition may be weaker or even reversed. Finally, we only examine cases wherein attribute information is provided using numeric information. However, sometimes attribute information is provided using quasi-numeric formats, such as when Verizon contrasts its cellular coverage with AT&amp;T using a map covered with more (vs. less) dots, without providing information relating to the actual number of dots. Would aligned (vs. nonaligned) display matter in such cases? Examining this and similar questions may further expand the applicability of this work.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">1In this section, we contrast a focal food item with fewer calories with a comparison food item with more calories.

Whereas power theory suggests that governance will reflect the preferences of powerful firms, efficiency theories argue that governance will maximize joint value. In this research, the authors provide an integrative framework that reconciles power and efficiency perspectives in the context of contractual marketing channel relationships. This framework discriminates between two methods of exercising power: ex ante (through a tightly specified, efficient contract that rewards the powerful firm through the price mechanism while providing strong safeguards for the weak firm) or ex post (through a loosely specified, inefficient contract that allows the powerful firm to exploit its power during renegotiations). The authors argue that power will cause channel governance to deviate from the efficient choice, but only to the extent that the powerful firm cannot price out (i.e., extract) the value it offers to the weaker firm ex ante. As exchange conditions become more uncertain, power will demonstrate stronger effects on governance. This theory is supported with data from studies on contractual research-and-development relationships and procurement contracts for customized industrial products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: contracting; efficiency; power; governance; marketing channels</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The design of contractual governance between independent parties in a marketing channel has been informed by two major but strikingly different perspectives: power and efficiency theories. The central claim of power theory is that observed governance will reflect the preferences of powerful firms ([<a id="bib2up

Efficiency theories, in contrast, argue that governance is chosen to maximize the joint value created in the channel as a whole, irrespective of the initial power differences between the firms ([<a id="bib6up

Because of this distinction, power and efficiency theories rarely converge on the same governance predictions ([35]; [71]). Indeed, one of the key motives underlying the development of efficiency theories like transaction cost analysis (TCA) was a desire to challenge the standard monopoly (power) argument put forth in applied price-theory approaches to industrial organization and antitrust ([48]). Accordingly, "Greater respect for organizational (as against technological) and for efficiency (as against monopoly) purposes is needed" ([71], p. 17).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The debate between power and efficiency perspectives has been acrimonious at times, with some sociologically inclined power theorists decrying the spread of economic approaches to the study of organization (e.g., [23]). Many institutional economists have been equally derisive of power: "The main problem with power is that the concept is so poorly defined that power can be and is invoked to explain virtually anything" ([71], p. 238). Prominent organizational theorists have similarly described the construct of power as diffuse and disappointing ([51]). Indeed, as early as 1980, Stern and Reve distinguished between these two "seemingly disparate" disciplinary orientations—a primarily economic perspective rooted in industrial organization and focused on efficiency (e.g., [<a id="bib4up

Even then, they expressed a concern about the lack of integration between the two viewpoints: "Rarely have there been attempts to integrate these two perspectives. Indeed, they should be viewed as complementary, because the former deals mainly with economic 'outputs' while the latter is concerned with behavioral 'processes'" ([65], p. 53).[<a id="bib5up

As such, meaningful integration of the two has been lacking. This indifference to the other perspective has led to certain limitations. For example, power theories have not been able to explain when and why powerful firms might choose governance that enhances joint value versus when they might deviate from this focus to accommodate their own self-interests. Likewise, efficiency theories have been mostly silent on how ex ante firm differences influence governance, although [29], [30]) governance value analysis is an exception. As a result, we have a limited understanding of how the two theories interact, the circumstances under which one or the other will be more determinative of channel governance, and the new insights that can be generated by considering the two within a unified framework.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Constructing one such unifying framework in the context of contractual marketing channel relationships is the goal of this study. Our core thesis is this: power will cause governance to deviate from the efficient structure, but only to the extent that uncertainty prevents the powerful firm from pricing out the value it offers to the weaker firm ex ante. By "pricing out," we mean that the price mechanism, rather than other aspects of the governance structure, is used by the powerful firm to extract the value of the unique resources it brings to the relationship. For example, when exchange conditions are less uncertain, rather than reducing or eliminating the safeguards provided to the weak firm, a powerful firm can instead charge a higher upfront price and couple this with the strong safeguards desired by the weak firm. In this sense, the price mechanism makes it unnecessary for the powerful firm to alter the ex post governance structure in its favor, leaving it in an efficient state. As such, when exchange conditions are less uncertain, power and efficiency theories will arrive at similar governance predictions. In contrast, when exchange conditions are more uncertain, we argue that the powerful firm cannot price out the value it offers and will therefore shift governance to its own advantage and away from the structure predicted by efficiency theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To conduct a clear test of this power–efficiency framework, we require settings in which efficiency theories provide an unambiguous prediction that is then compromised by power as exchange conditions become more uncertain. Accordingly, we select two contexts in which the exposed specific investments are predominantly made by the buyer (in the technology/equipment supplied by the vendor), with comparatively limited (nonreimbursed) investments made by the vendor.[<a id="bib6up

In the first, where clients sponsor technical development work by external contract research organizations (CROs), we investigate two sets of safeguards: price inflexibility and client-exclusive property rights over the technology. In the second, where industrial buyers purchase customized equipment systems from vendors, we investigate price inflexibility and performance guarantees as safeguards. These contexts enable us to provide evidence on the generalizability of our framework across substantively different governance forms: price inflexibility, property rights, and performance guarantees. Consistent with our thesis, in both contexts we find that when contracting with more powerful vendors, safeguards are weaker <em>only</em> in more uncertain environments. That is, both power <em>and</em> uncertainty must be present to produce an effect on safeguards and pull them away from efficiency-theory predictions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research makes several contributions. First, our integrative framework contributes to both literature streams by describing the conditions under which powerful firms will act to promote efficiency within their channels versus those in which they will bias governance toward their own self-interests and away from efficiency. The current TCA literature is generally silent on when and why firms might choose inefficient governance forms, and the power literature similarly cannot predict when firms will refrain from exercising their power. We also add to the power literature by describing the conditions under which powerful firms will apply their influence ex ante, at the governance selection stage, versus ex post, over activities and bargaining in the ongoing relationship.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our work builds on and complements a small body of research that has worked toward integrating power and efficiency theories, principally [37] and [62]. Both see power as interfering with the standard TCA predictions, but for different reasons. In the context of ongoing supply arrangements, [37] recognize the fundamental conflict between power and efficiency and view the presence of cooperative norms as critical to smoothing concerns about the abuse of ex post power—reverse opportunism in [47] terminology—and allowing the efficient transfer of control as predicted by TCA and property rights theory. Our approach differs in that we focus on ex ante power derived from extrarelational resources and develop the interplay between power and efficiency <em>within</em> the incomplete contracting framework itself, thus allowing us to address governance issues even in relationships not endowed with strong norms ([<a id="bib6up

This, in turn, dulls the empirical relationships between the standard TCA predictors and vertical integration. In their approach, power, when present, <em>never fails</em> to weaken the efficiency prediction. That is, there is no factor that inhibits the influence of power on governance and, as a result, their theory cannot predict the conditions under which powerful firms will refrain from influencing governance away from TCA predictions. We suggest a more nuanced interaction in which power moves governance away from efficiency, but <em>only</em> in sufficiently uncertain conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, relatedly, our work complements research on the governance value analysis (GVA) framework ([29], [30]) that also uses the incomplete contracting perspective to describe relationships between ex ante firm characteristics and governance forms. Whereas [29], [30]) consider how firms with differentiated (i.e., power-generating) market positions are motivated to choose contracts that <em>protect</em> these extrarelational resources from expropriation ex post, our framework sheds light on the flip side of this issue by considering how these firms can best <em>exploit</em> their power by discriminatingly aligning governance forms with different exchange conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, one of the notable shortcomings of TCA is its incomplete treatment of bounded rationality and differences in firm preferences in the process used to select governance structures. Essentially, it is assumed that firms will somehow automatically "find their way" to the most efficient arrangement. This limitation has gone largely unremarked on since the foundational work of [11]. We contribute by analyzing how different contracting environments change the criterion used to select governance—power or efficiency.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article is organized as follows. We begin with a brief review of power and efficiency theories. We then develop our unifying framework in the context of contractual channel relationships for two distinct, but conceptually similar, inputs and draw refutable predictions that are tested with primary data.

Power is most commonly defined as the ability of one party to bring about its desired outcomes by influencing the actions of others ([19]; [39]). Firms are more powerful to the extent they possess unique and difficult-to-imitate resources that make them valuable to potential partners (e.g., [14]). This value gives them a degree of influence over governance selection ex ante as well as activities and bargaining in the ongoing relationship ex post (e.g., [25]; [33]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The central principle of power theory is that powerful firms will use their positions to align governance structures with their own preferences (e.g., [27]; [35]). In many instances, powerful firms use their influence to organize the channel more efficiently (e.g., [32]; [62]; [65]). In this role, they not only provide information, expertise, and legitimacy to better coordinate channel activities but also resolve sticky channel management problems such as free riding that would otherwise increase transaction costs and reduce efficiency. One illustration of this coordinating role played by powerful firms is the decision control accorded to franchisors by less powerful franchisees ([50]). Franchisors can use this control to enforce territorial restrictions, prevent free riding off the efforts of other franchisees, direct system-wide promotional activities, and take other steps to enhance efficiency. At the same time, power theory recognizes that firms may use their positions in ways that do not enhance joint value, instead favoring themselves at the expense of weaker counterparties (e.g., [33]; [50]). For example, the practice of powerful franchisors forcing franchisor-specific investments on weak franchisees has been frequently cited as an "unfair" abuse of franchisor power ([47]). Similarly, supply relationships with powerful retailers are often heavily biased in the retailer's favor (e.g., [44]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite its intuitive appeal, the power perspective has three shortcomings. First, it is not clear as to when and why powerful firms would choose to play the role of enhancing joint value versus focusing primarily on their own payoff. Second, while power theories have focused on the role of ex ante power, they have failed to distinguish this from ex post power that arises from the "fundamental transformation" in which investments in specific assets lead to a small-numbers bargaining environment ([71]).[<a id="bib7up

A comparative governance analysis considers the choice between alternative governance forms simultaneously, rather than seeking to explain each choice in isolation as power theories do. This limitation is best illustrated by example. Suppose we wish to explain the use of a direct sales force as opposed to independent reps. The power of the firm relative to the salesperson might explain the decision to go direct (i.e., the more powerful firm forces salespeople into employment relationships that are subject to greater control and usually offer lower rewards than those the same individuals could earn as independent contractors). However, under a comparative analysis, it is not clear why vertical integration is the preferred way for the firm to leverage its power over salespeople. Instead, the firm could use its power to bargain for a significantly lower commission rate from independent reps. Power can explain both governance alternatives in isolation but does not discriminate between the two in a comparative fashion.[<a id="bib8up

In particular, the more powerful firm could force <em>either</em> an inflexible, tightly specified contract in which it extracts its value through the price mechanism by charging a premium price, or a more flexible, loosely specified contract that allows it to exploit its power and extract value during ex post renegotiations. Both options potentially increase its gains from the relationship; however, it is not clear which governance option the firm would choose and why. [50], p. 22) express this conundrum quite lucidly: "It could certainly be argued that the more powerful channel member would not need an explicit contract because it would not need any safeguards; the weaker party could do little harm to it because of its less powerful position. The problem with this argument is that it goes against the strong empirical evidence that more powerful channel partners, such as franchisors, extensively use explicit contracts."</p><a id="AN0136892984-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-4" title="The Efficiency Perspective">The Efficiency Perspective</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Efficiency theories such as TCA, property rights theory, and incomplete contracting theory have also driven an enormous body of literature in marketing, having been used to predict vertical integration (e.g., [<a id="bib1up

In other words, the fact that one firm has more power ex ante does not alter the optimal governance arrangement within the channel ex post. Rather, ex ante power only affects how the gains from adopting the efficient arrangement are divided among the parties, with more powerful firms extracting a greater share of this "surplus" ([34]; [68]). [11] and [68] illustrate how a system of ex ante transfers, or side payments, can be devised such that each firm will prefer the efficient ex post arrangement after taking the transfers into account. This is because joint profit is maximized under the efficient arrangement; thus, these transfers will always be of sufficient magnitude to compensate the counterparty for its losses in case it is (initially) worse off under the efficient arrangement. The most common forms of ex ante transfers in practice are the price one firm pays to acquire another in the case of integration or the agreed on transfer price (e.g., franchise fee) in a contractual channel setting.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Efficiency theories, however, are subject to important shortcomings of their own that have received relatively little attention. In particular, they are largely silent on the process by which all parties come to accept the efficient governance structure. If efficient governance is Pareto optimal (i.e., makes all firms at least as well off as feasible alternatives), the issue is trivial. However, if efficient governance is not in the best interest of all parties—particularly powerful parties—how is it that they come to accept it? As [68], p. 463) observes, "The process (the game) through which the possibilities for trade are explored is suppressed, the assumption being that it is optimal; or more precisely, that the parties will (somehow) find the optimal process." Thus, even though [71], p. 174) uses natural selection arguments to defend efficiency when he says "the [efficiency] argument relies in a general, background way on the efficacy of competition to perform a sort between more and less efficient modes and to shift resources in favor of the former," he acknowledges the limits of this assumption: "This intuition would nevertheless benefit from a more fully developed theory of the selection process. Transaction cost arguments are thus open to some of the same objections that evolutionary economists have made of orthodoxy."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Crucially, the natural selection arguments invoked in TCA are not simply underdeveloped. They are in fact not well suited to relationships involving powerful firms, because departures from efficiency within the channel need not harm <em>these</em> firms. In particular, a powerful firm could be better off in a less efficient relationship that is biased in its favor, in which case the survival risk from the adoption of inefficient governance falls on the weaker, often replaceable, partner. Natural selection, therefore, cannot be a sufficient argument for efficiency when powerful firms are involved because there is no reason to assume that selection will somehow force a <em>joint</em> profit-maximizing outcome.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Indeed, per the Coase theorem, an efficient solution is only feasible in a frictionless environment characterized by complete contracting where the parties can commit to both the ex ante transfer and to refraining from opportunistic bargaining ex post. In an incomplete contracting environment, there is no assurance that the efficient arrangement can be made acceptable to both parties ([11]; [70]). Said differently, the implementation of an efficient governance structure essentially comes down to whether one party—here, the weaker party—can pay the other party to accept it ([68]). In turn, the powerful firm must be able to credibly commit to the efficient governance structure and assure the weaker party that it will not exercise its power again ex post. If such credible commitments are not feasible, due to incomplete contracting, the efficiency argument against the influence of power breaks down.</p><a id="AN0136892984-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-5" title="An Integrative Power and Efficiency Framework">An Integrative Power and Efficiency Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The integrated perspective we develop next is generalizable to a wide variety of channel contexts; however, to provide an unambiguous empirical test of the resulting theory, we seek contexts in which the efficient governance structure can be clearly identified so that we can detect departures from efficiency due to power. We do so in two different channels, one in which client firms sponsor technical development work performed by external CROs (Study 1) and a second in which industrial buyers purchase customized equipment systems from vendors (Study 2). These contexts have two key features. First, unlike typical manufacturer–supplier or manufacturer–distributor settings, the nature of the core activity—research and development (R&amp;D) and systems purchasing—is considerably discrete or lumpy. As such, each transaction stands on its own and long-run relational give and take (the "shadow of the future") is not of as much significance. This assures us that contractual terms cannot be trivially renegotiated without some risk of opportunism when ex post adjustments are required. Second, in both settings, the primary exposed specific investments are made by the client/buyer. This implies that the main exchange hazard is opportunism by the CRO/vendor against which the client/buyer requires a safeguard.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Under these two key aspects of our settings, by examining the extent to which CRO/vendor power reduces safeguards for the client/buyer, we can see the effect of power on the efficient governance structure.

In the context of Study 1, powerful CROs will generally prefer more flexible price contracts (e.g., with adjustment formulas negotiated ex post) not only to protect themselves from cost overruns but also to extract value from the client during ex post adjustments prior to transferring the technology. Similarly, they will prefer to secure some usage and ownership rights over the intellectual property developed in the relationship, because this intellectual property often serves as the basis for future development work ([<a id="bib7up

Expropriating this value is not feasible when prices are inflexible (i.e., fixed) and the client has exclusive property rights; therefore, powerful CROs have an incentive to bargain against such safeguards in the contract.

In our context, in which the main specific investments are made by the client, safeguards in the form of less flexible prices and the use of contractual clauses that assign property rights exclusively to the client are both expected to increase as uncertainty increases. Thus:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Uncertainty is positively related to the use of contractual clauses that (a) restrict property rights exclusively to the client and (b) specify inflexible prices, ceteris paribus.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, we turn to the critical interaction between power and efficiency theories. We start from the position that the powerful firm sets the governance structure in the relationship ex ante because it is unique and can bid down potential weak partners until one of them accepts its terms for participation ([50]). In selecting governance, the powerful firm faces two options. First, it could opt for efficient governance in which joint value is maximized. In our context, such an efficient governance structure would feature a tightly specified contract that provides strong safeguards for the client's investments while rewarding the powerful CRO by enabling it to extract (i.e., price out) the unique value it provides through the price mechanism ex ante. Alternately, the powerful firm may select an inefficient governance form that gives it an opportunity to maximize its own direct rewards from the relationship.[10] In our context, this governance structure would be more informal, with weaker safeguards for the client, thereby allowing the powerful CRO to exploit its power during ex post renegotiations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Which option will a powerful CRO choose? Note that the powerful firm must be at least as well off under the inefficient as opposed to the efficient governance structure; otherwise it would not choose the former. Because, by definition, joint value must be lower for the inefficient structure, the weak firm is necessarily worse off under the inefficient arrangement.[11] The weak firm will therefore prefer the efficient arrangement and has an incentive to offer an ex ante transfer in exchange for a commitment from the powerful firm to the efficient governance structure. In turn, the powerful firm will accept this only if it is better off following the ex ante transfer; otherwise it will prefer the inefficient arrangement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When conditions (i.e., low uncertainty) permit more complete contracts to be constructed, the first-best strategy for a powerful CRO will be to choose the efficient governance structure in exchange for an ex ante transfer of sufficient magnitude to make it better off. In such circumstances, both firms will prefer efficient governance, and ex ante power differences between the two firms will not cause a deviation from this choice because the powerful firm has extracted its value ex ante.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In contrast, when complete contracts are more difficult to construct (i.e., high uncertainty), the picture is quite different. First, note that the weak firm will be reluctant to offer an ex ante transfer without a reciprocal commitment guaranteeing the powerful firm's actions ex post; otherwise it could be held up repeatedly. Recourse could be made at this point to the self-enforcing aspects of informal contracts based on reputation ([47]). However, given that the more powerful firm will typically have better prospects in the event of termination, informal contracts are not necessarily self-enforcing in situations where power is highly imbalanced. Importantly, this inability to rely on the self-enforcing mechanism actually works <em>against</em> the powerful firm by making it harder to commit to the efficient arrangement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given this inability to commit, a powerful CRO will seek a second-best method to capture the value it offers to the client. It does so by implementing an inefficient governance structure with weak (or nonexistent) safeguards that maximizes its ability to extend its ex ante power into the relationship and expropriate value through ex post bargaining. Importantly, the powerful CRO is actually worse off in this case than in the first-best scenario (i.e., complete contracting where its power is priced out ex ante) because, given the inability to commit, the client's incentives to invest under an inefficient governance structure are lower. However, given the constraints on contracting, this second-best strategy is optimal from the powerful CRO's perspective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Note the distinction between our thesis and the classic power-oriented view. The latter suggests that the weak firm should accept the terms offered by the powerful firm, even if they are one-sided, because they either reduce uncertainty for the weaker party ([21]) or set parameters on what the more powerful party can do ([50]). In contrast, our argument recognizes not only the role of the price mechanism and its interplay with the choice of ex post governance but also the proactive role played by the nominally weaker party. In less uncertain conditions, the weak firm offers an appropriate transfer payment ex ante with the expectation that the powerful firm will credibly commit to limiting its influence ex post. The better the commitment offered (i.e., the closer safeguards are to the efficient level), the higher the initial transfer payment the weak firm is willing to make. In contrast, in more uncertain conditions, the powerful firm is unable to make such a commitment. As such, the option of pricing out power through an ex ante payment becomes untenable, making the powerful firm choose an inefficient governance arrangement to extract the value from its unique resources ex post. This enables us to tackle the [50] conundrum by explaining why powerful firms use tightly constructed explicit contracts in some situations and not in others.

In these settings, the client makes specific investments in a technology developed by the CRO, which is reimbursed for its client-specific development work. These relationships are governed by a development agreement, which is a formal contract specifying the nature of the deliverables, pricing terms, and property rights provisions for the technology and its derivatives ([<a id="bib7up

First, very few data sets are available on outsourced R&amp;D projects in general, and most secondary archives (e.g., the Deloitte/ReCap database) cover only large R&amp;D alliances in narrowly defined industries. Second, our unit of analysis is an individual outsourced R&amp;D project; thus, firm-level archival data would be only indirectly related to any given project and might introduce aggregation bias into the analysis. Third, certain constructs (e.g., the number of qualified contractors available at the outset of the project, financial investments in the project, uncertainty) are difficult to measure without relying on key informants. For example, uncertainty could be measured by volatility in industry or company sales, but these would be at best crude and indirect measures of the uncertainty surrounding an individual R&amp;D project. Thus, we used our own survey instrument to capture the nuances of the context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Many of the constructs we measure have meanings that are well-known and widely shared among informants in the industry, such as firm fixed prices ([61]). We therefore use single-item, grounded measures (i.e., with defined metrics) to capture the constructs of interest wherever possible. As [61] and [16] observe, trying to introduce additional items into the measurement of such constructs can cause measures to drift from the well-defined meanings. We use psychometric measures only where a domain sampling approach is supportive of validity. In particular, the measure of uncertainty is best captured by a multi-item reflective scale due to the multifaceted nature of this domain, particularly as it relates to contractual incompleteness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given our focus on high-technology, research intensive industries where outsourced R&amp;D is common, we used National Science Foundation data to select the top five three-digit industries in terms of the percentage of firms outsourcing R&amp;D: drugs and medicines; optical, surgical, and photographic instruments; communications equipment; motor vehicles and equipment; and aircraft and missiles. We used a national list broker to compile a list of 2,600 R&amp;D managers with a single manager per firm. After eliminating 635 bad contacts, we contacted each manager to solicit participation. We used a snowballing technique to identify a qualified informant, even if different from the original contact. A total of 670 initial contacts could not be reached after extensive effort. Among the 1,295 individuals successfully contacted by telephone, 226 reported that no R&amp;D was conducted in their unit and could not connect us with another manager in their company involved in R&amp;D. A substantially larger number of 496 individuals were involved in R&amp;D but indicated that their company did not outsource these activities. Again, this number includes only those instances in which a referral to a manager in a unit that did outsource R&amp;D was not possible. Another 168 managers were involved with outsourced R&amp;D projects but refused to participate. This left 405 qualified informants who verbally agreed to participate in the mail questionnaire. Follow-up phone calls and a second mailing resulted in 124 useable surveys with complete data on the variables included in this study. This yielded a 30.6% response rate based on the number of surveys mailed (124 of 405) or a 21.6% response rate based on the number of qualified informants identified (124 of 573). The former proportion is similar to the approximately 30% response rate in [36] and 37% in [30], though neither study distinguishes between the number of surveys mailed and number of qualified informants.[12] One drawback of operating in the context of outsourced R&amp;D is that firms are sensitive to disclosing their R&amp;D partners because this is often perceived as a source of competitive advantage. Thus, we were only able to collect data from the client side of each dyad.</p><a id="AN0136892984-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-8" title="Measures">Measures</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We provide the measurement items following purification and response scales in Web Appendix W1.

Uncertainty is classically operationalized in terms of volatility and ambiguity (e.g., [52]). Volatility arises when conditions change frequently in ways that are difficult to predict ex ante ([41]), yet are readily understood ex post ([57]). Ambiguity, in contrast, arises when conditions are difficult to interpret ex post, irrespective of the rate of change ([52]). Because various aspects of volatility and ambiguity can lead to incomplete contracting conditions, we define the construct broadly in this study following a domain sampling approach. The four subdomains are market volatility, defined as the frequency of unanticipated changes in the market relevant to the technology ([36]; [41]; [66]); technological volatility, defined as the frequency of unanticipated changes in the technologies used in the development process ([36]; [40]; [66]); ambiguity, defined as the extent to which signals are open to multiple interpretations ([13]; [52]); and the level of creativity required to perform the development work (another aspect of ambiguity as described by [<a id="bib5up

Therefore, we formulate a measure that increases as each aspect of uncertainty increases to capture the overall effect of the various dimensions. This approach offers the key benefit of smoothing the measure across the individual facets. To see the importance of this, consider a simple example. A relationship with low volatility may not be characterized by low uncertainty if ambiguity is high. We use a second-order factor model to provide support for the multidimensional construction of uncertainty and subject it to a confirmatory factor analysis following [43]. Fit statistics following purification suggest an inability to reject the proposed model (χ<sup>2</sup>(86) = 101.938, <em>p</em> =.116; goodness-of-fit index =.909; root mean square error of approximation =.037; Tucker–Lewis index =.970). The composite reliability of the measure is.925 ([69]). We do not include other indicators in the factor analysis because they are not reflective measures. We averaged the items within each subdomain and then equally weighted the subdomains to form the final score.

pay attention to the zero values for the variables involved in the interactions when interpreting their main effects. In particular, the theory indicates that CRO power will have its strongest effect under high uncertainty. To showcase this, we center uncertainty so that the zero value corresponds to the maximum value of this variable in the data. This allows the main effect of CRO power to correspond to a situation in which it is theoretically expected to have its largest effect. Observe that this centering does not fundamentally alter the estimates, and we graph the full detail of the interactions next.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also account for potential endogeneity among the regressors. The most serious concern revolves around the financial investments made by both parties that are selected simultaneously with governance. To address this, we estimate the models using Gaussian copulas. Copulas are a class of function that allow the joint distribution to be constructed from the individual marginal distributions. The method is a semiparametric, instrument-free approach to handling endogeneity that models the joint distribution of the error term and the endogenous regressors directly, thereby accommodating correlation between them. This differs from instrumental variable methods in which exogenous instruments are used in an attempt to purge correlations between the error term and the endogenous regressors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Following [58], we assume that the error term is normally distributed following the probit specification. We then estimate the marginal distribution of each endogenous right-hand-side variable nonparametrically using an Epanechnikov kernel density function with [63] recommended bandwidth calculation. We use the two-step control function variant described by [58] because it extends easily to multiple endogenous regressors.

On average, the contracts had 1.13 provisions restricting some aspect of property rights exclusively to the client and 62.6% of contracts specify either a firm fixed price or a price subject to a predetermined adjustment formula. Prior to reverse coding the CRO power measure, the average is 1.603, indicating that most firms had one or two equally or better qualified CROs available, in addition to the one they used. This number is low enough to suggest that the typical CRO possessed a degree of monopoly power. The mean of uncertainty is 3.593 on a 1–7 scale. Most clients invested between $100,000 and $499,000 in the project, whereas the typical unreimbursed investment by the CRO was between $10,000 and $249,000.

We find that CRO power has a negative and significant effect on the exclusivity of client property rights (β = −.671, <em>p</em> =.008), suggesting that more powerful CROs bargain for a greater share of property rights, in support of H<sub>1a</sub>. Uncertainty has a positive and significant effect (β =.558, <em>p</em> =.036), suggesting that clients retain more exclusive property rights as uncertainty increases and exchange hazards become more pronounced, in support of H<sub>2a</sub>. The critical interaction between CRO power and uncertainty is negative and significant (β = −.232, <em>p</em> =.032), suggesting that CRO power has a stronger negative effect on the exclusivity of client property rights under high uncertainty where power cannot be efficiently priced out ex ante, in support of H<sub>3a</sub>.[14]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We graphically depict the relationship between CRO power and the client exclusivity of property rights in Figure 1, Panel A, over a range of two standard deviations above and below the mean of uncertainty (3.593). The interaction crosses over a little less than one standard deviation below the mean of uncertainty.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. Effects of power over ±2 SDs of uncertainty.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The fact that the interaction crosses over is of substantive interest. In developing our theory, we emphasized the role that high uncertainty and the resulting contractual incompleteness play in allowing power to distort governance away from efficiency. However, we did not discuss how power might also alter the <em>efficient</em> governance adopted under low uncertainty. Even though power is priced out under such conditions and does not cause governance to deviate from efficiency, it may still influence the nature of the efficient structure itself. Recall that TCA predicts the use of stronger safeguards in the presence of factors that threaten joint value–enhancing outcomes. While largely ignored in the efficiency literature, ex ante power itself is one such factor. Thus, when dealing with a powerful partner, the weak firm may be willing to pay for stronger safeguards because it will fare worse outside the boundaries of the safeguard.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate, pricing terms with negotiated adjustments usually specify that firms will negotiate in good faith over the final price based on the realized costs of the development work. These terms provide a degree of protection by framing the ex post bargaining problem. When firms have balanced power, such framing, in conjunction with price flexibility, provides a safeguard while limiting potential maladaptation costs associated with firmer pricing schemes ([30]). However, if power is imbalanced, more predetermined pricing terms (either prespecified adjustment formulas or firm fixed prices) become more efficient because the weak firm now requires more than framing to protect itself during ex post bargaining. The interaction in Figure 1, Panel A, shows that, in addition to biasing ex post governance in favor of the powerful firm (with lower safeguards for the weak firm) when conditions of incomplete contracting prevail (i.e., the right-hand side of the graph), greater power also appears to prompt an efficient governance arrangement featuring stronger safeguards for the weak firm when conditions of more complete contracting prevail (the left-hand side of the graph).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Turning to the control variables, the client's financial investment is positively related (β =.197, <em>p</em> &lt;.05) and the CRO's unreimbursed financial investment is negatively related (β = −.272, <em>p</em> &lt;.05) to the exclusivity of client property rights. Work performed on the client's site involves more exclusive client property rights (β =.928, <em>p</em> =.066), though this result is only significant at <em>p</em> &lt;.10. Similarly, as the number of CROs in the extended task environment increases, clients retain more exclusive property rights, as we anticipated (β =.056, <em>p</em> &lt;.05). Of the four variables representing the percentage of the work performed in-house by the client, we find only that as the percentage of hours performed by the client increase, its property rights become more exclusive (β =.026, <em>p</em> &lt;.05).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The endogeneity correction term for the CRO's investment is significant at <em>p</em> &lt;.10. This serves as a Durbin test for the endogeneity of this variable. Interestingly, the CRO's financial investment is endogenous, whereas that of the client is not. We suspect that this is because the latter is largely a function of the desired technology. The correlated portion of the effect is captured in the negative coefficient on  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>*</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>  , leaving a weaker coefficient reflecting the portion that is not affected by endogeneity. The main limitation of the copula method is that the distributions of the endogenous variables must differ from that of the error term. If the distributions are too similar, multicollinearity between the generated regressors and the error term will reduce efficiency, though it will not introduce bias. The level of statistical significance in the results suggests that this is not an issue in the present investigation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results of the probit model predicting price inflexibility appear in Column B of Table 2. Consistent with H<sub>1b</sub>, we find a negative and significant effect of CRO power (β = −.691, <em>p</em> =.017). Consistent with H<sub>2b</sub>, we find a positive coefficient for uncertainty (β =.525, <em>p</em> =.073), though this result is only significant at <em>p</em> &lt;.10. The interaction between CRO power and uncertainty is negative and significant (β = −.252, <em>p</em> =.032), which supports H<sub>3b</sub>. Again, CRO power has a stronger effect on governance under high uncertainty in which power cannot be efficiently priced out ex ante.[15]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1, Panel A, also depicts this relationship graphically. Again, the interaction crosses over at a little less than −1 standard deviations in uncertainty. The interpretation is identical: under more complete contracting conditions, safeguards for the client are <em>stronger</em> when dealing with a more powerful CRO. Turning to the control variables, we see that the client's financial investment is positively related (β =.207, <em>p</em> &lt;.05), whereas development tasks (β = −.770, <em>p</em> &lt;.05), CRO patents (β = −.551, <em>p</em> =.089), and the percentage of hours performed by the client (β = −.019, <em>p</em> =.068) are all negatively related to price inflexibility. All other effects are insignificant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, Column C of Table 2 presents results for the ordered probit model on price inflexibility.

The reliance on a specific vendor creates a dependency for the buyer and vulnerability to vendor opportunism because investments are sunk before performance is realized. Vendors usually build the development costs into the final price; thus, they do not have significant exposed investments for buyer-specific customization. Contracts governing these purchases usually consist of the necessary features of the customized product, the pricing terms, and clauses pertaining to performance guarantees for how the system will function once installed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We investigate the power × efficiency interaction on two forms of safeguards in these relationships: inflexibility of the pricing terms before/during supply and whether the vendor commits contractually to a performance guarantee of its system after supply. As in Study 1, ex ante vendor power is measured by the number of equally qualified vendors available at the outset of the relationship. Because there is generally less ambiguity in the production of industrial systems than R&amp;D, we use a more traditional measure of uncertainty for studies in the channels literature, volatility.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similar to Study 1, we expect that powerful vendors will prefer more flexible price contracts (e.g., with adjustment formulas negotiated ex post) to protect themselves from cost overruns and will also try to avoid providing costly performance guarantees to buyers (H<sub>1</sub>), especially in more volatile conditions in which the features necessary to provide a certain level of performance can shift. Likewise, having committed to procuring customized equipment, buyers will seek safeguards in the form of fixed prices and performance guarantees as uncertainty increases (H<sub>2</sub>). The logic for the key power × efficiency interaction (H<sub>3</sub>) is similar to that in Study 1. In particular, when uncertainty is low, a powerful vendor will be willing to provide the safeguards that the buyer seeks—fixed prices and performance guarantees—in exchange for an ex ante transfer that enables it to capture the unique value it provides the buyer through the price mechanism. In contrast, when uncertainty is high, the powerful vendor cannot offer a credible guarantee that after having received a transfer payment ex ante it will not create a holdup problem ex post. It will also be more reticent to provide performance guarantees given uncertainty surrounding the necessary features/technology. Given this infeasibility to price out its power ex ante, the powerful vendor will seek governance forms with weaker safeguards that enable it to expropriate value through ex post bargaining. Thus, the expected relationships are identical to Study 1, with the exception of examining performance guarantees rather than client exclusive property rights.</p><a id="AN0136892984-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-21" title="Data">Data</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We examine four industry sectors: industrial machinery and equipment, electrical and electronics equipment, transportation equipment, and instrumentation.

Rather than summarily dismissing power, as is common in efficiency arguments, we incorporate power into the comparative governance analysis used in efficiency theories to explain the role it plays in governance design. Specifically, we argue that power affects governance only under conditions of sufficiently high uncertainty (i.e., when conditions prevent the powerful firm from pricing out the value it offers to the weaker firm ex ante). Results from two separate contexts, involving three different contractual safeguards chosen by these firms, provide support for this argument. Because we do not treat either power or efficiency as "dominant" in our framework a priori, we arrive at a richer understanding of the conditions under which each will be more influential.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Crucially, we identify a factor—uncertainty—that can inhibit the impact of <em>both</em> power and efficiency on governance. When uncertainty is low and contracting is more feasible, the powerful firm has an incentive to support efficient, joint value maximizing governance. It can secure the value it offers to its partner ex ante through the price mechanism while simultaneously providing a safeguard by foregoing its influence on ex post governance. As a result, the impact of power on governance is inhibited. In contrast, when uncertainty is high making contracts more incomplete, the powerful firm cannot price out the value it offers. Thus, it purposefully seeks an inefficient arrangement that enables it to claim value ex post under more informally specified governance. As a result, the role of efficiency is inhibited.</p><a id="AN0136892984-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-26" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0136892984-27"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-27" title="Contributions to power theory">Contributions to power theory</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One weakness of power theory has been its inability to discriminate between governance choices using a comparative analysis. As described previously, in the R&amp;D context, a powerful CRO could exercise its power by limiting ex post safeguards for the client—for example, by insisting on flexible prices and nonexclusive client property rights. Alternatively, it could attempt to extract the full value it offers to the client by requiring it to pay the highest possible (fixed) price ex ante and then providing strong safeguards, such as exclusive and strongly protected client property rights, to maximize the client's incentives to invest in the relationship. Both seem equally plausible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By employing the comparative governance lens used fruitfully in efficiency theories, we simultaneously compare the role of power on each of the two feasible alternative governance forms. We then show that under less uncertain conditions, the powerful firm provides the client with efficient safeguards ex post (and prices out its power ex ante). Under more uncertain conditions, this mechanism becomes infeasible, forcing the powerful firm to use a second-best strategy by seeking gains ex post through flexible contractual terms (e.g., flexible prices). In contrast, in [62], the powerful firm always shifts away from integration because its power gives it the legitimacy to impose value-creating actions while avoiding the high costs of integration. Despite this difference, both studies show that power and efficiency are not simply competing explanations but that ex ante power can influence ex post governance systematically under key exchange conditions.</p><a id="AN0136892984-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-28" title="Contributions to TCA">Contributions to TCA</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One weakness of efficiency theories such as TCA has been that they have ignored the role of ex ante resource and power differentials on governance under the premise that boundedly rational actors with conflicting preferences will somehow "naturally select" the path to efficient governance. Said otherwise, inefficient arrangements will die out, supporting [72] dictum that economizing is the best strategy. Our approach instead attends to the microanalytic process particulars ([71]) and showcases the procedure used to adopt governance. Specifically, the process underlying our theory suggests that natural selection is not sufficient because the powerful firm, even though desiring of efficient joint value–maximizing solutions, would choose inefficient governance to capture value under conditions (uncertainty) which prevent it from securing the value derived from its power ex ante and credibly offering efficient safeguards.</p><a id="AN0136892984-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-29" title="Contributions to formal contracting">Contributions to formal contracting</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This literature, predominantly based on efficiency theories, has investigated a wide variety of governance challenges in marketing channels.

We contribute to this literature in several important ways.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, our work emphasizes the importance of considering both the terms of the contract and the initial price. Analyzing one without the other can be misleading. For example, a powerful firm may grant generous (efficient) safeguards to a weaker partner but in turn demand a higher upfront price. Indeed, our results in Figure 1 show that the safeguards provided for the weaker firm may be <em>stronger</em> in the presence of a more powerful partner when complete contracts can be written (i.e., the left-hand side of these graphs). Looking at these safeguards without considering the initial price would lead to incorrect inferences about the balance of power in the relationship and the motives of the parties.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, as a complement to studies such as [30] and [55], our work emphasizes the need to focus on both the ex ante and ex post features of governance to understand the different ways they interact in particular contexts. For instance, whereas the [30] GVA model is concerned with the protection of value creating assets that get intermingled in supply relationships, we focus on how powerfully resourced firms leverage their power. In particular, the clients/industrial buyers in our contexts contract with the CROs/vendors precisely because they want these CROs/vendors to build for them technologies/systems based on their technical capabilities. As such, there are limits to the reverse holdup problem that GVA focuses on because a CRO/vendor that fears leakage could simply decline to offer the technology ex ante. Given this, the exercise of power, rather than the protection of rent-generating assets, becomes the key motive for the CROs/vendors. The invocation of these alternative facets of power suggests a complementarity between these approaches that is context dependent and warrants future attention. For instance, one fruitful direction would be to predict the conditions under which the drive to exploit power-generating assets would trump the need to protect the value of these assets from expropriation and vice versa.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we extend [47] analysis to illuminate the nature of "unfairness" expected in formal contracts. In particular, we suggest that "unfairness" in formal contracts due to an imbalance in power will primarily be reflected in the price, not other terms. Why? Our analysis has shown that a more complete contract is necessary to price out the influence of power ex ante and that such a strategy is first-best for the powerful firm when feasible. Importantly, this contract is first-best only because it maximizes the investment of the weaker firm, which is achieved by providing a credible commitment to treat it fairly by providing appropriate safeguards. If environmental conditions are such that a complete contract can be written, it will tend to reflect this pattern, with fair treatment of the weaker firm ex post but power reflected in the seemingly "unfair" price ex ante. Yet this price is merely a symptom of the overall fair treatment of the weaker firm. It is, of course, a matter for policy makers to decide at what point the price is actually unfair or merely a reflection of the value offered by the powerful firm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, as power becomes more balanced or symmetric across firms, the bargaining at relationship formation will be influenced more evenly and is likely to draw governance closer to joint value maximization. Importantly, this means that incomplete contracting alone should not result in serious deviations from efficiency without differences in firm power. More equally placed firms should progress toward a more mutually beneficial (albeit informal) governance structure, even under incomplete contracting conditions. It is only when contracts are incomplete <em>and</em> one firm has a power advantage that it can push for an arrangement that allows it to exploit its power ex post and major deviations from efficiency are expected. We summarize this relationship in Figure 2. When uncertainty is low, under both balanced and unbalanced power conditions, governance is both formal and efficient, because parties can construct ex ante transfers along with efficient contractual terms. In contrast, when uncertainty is high and power is balanced, the ex ante transfers necessary to support efficient contracts cannot be constructed and parties have to resort to informal governance. Such informal governance is efficient under balanced power conditions since negotiations will naturally tend toward more mutually beneficial outcomes. It is only when power is imbalanced and contracting incomplete that we expect to see informal arrangements which inefficiently favor the powerful firm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

That is, these relationships will feature contracts without fixed prices, without exclusive property rights provisions for the client (even though the client has paid for the R&amp;D effort), and without performance guarantees. Thus, they will rely on more informal, relational, implicit contracts that lack legally binding safeguards. Importantly, while the literature on informal governance tends to associate it with the presence of relational norms or a shadow of the future, our analysis suggests that informal governance could also be imposed by a powerful firm if it cannot provide the credible commitment necessary to price out its power ex ante. Crucially, it is imposed specifically to expropriate value from the weaker firm during ex post bargaining. In this case, informal governance is neither efficient nor indicative of a cooperative, mutually oriented relationship; it is simply a second-best, but feasible, choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our framework can also be used to shed light on certain aspects of informal governance that have not received much attention in the literature. One such issue is whether relational norms in a given context are flexible (more incomplete social contracts) or more rigid (more complete social contracts). In [37], norms facilitate the transfer of control while constraining the actions of the controlling firm; thus, they may be viewed as promoting rigidity in the social contract. In our contexts, informal governance will involve price and behavioral expectations, even though not formally specified. A party that offers generous compensation to its partner ex ante might expect the relationship to unfold in a certain manner; it would not expect or tolerate ex post bargaining when adjustments are required. In this sense, the informal governance structure (social contract) is more rigid. In contrast, a party holding the line on compensation may anticipate some degree of resistance and bargaining ex post that the parties recognize as more legitimate. Here, the social contract is more flexible.</p><a id="AN0136892984-31"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-31" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The results provide guidance to managers overseeing contractual channel relationships. For managers of powerful firms, we offer a new way of thinking about the role and exercise of power. It complements the prevailing view that power allows the firm to influence the ex post behavior of others within the relationship by suggesting that managers must also recognize and use the price mechanism to extract the value provided by their unique resources. Indeed, where feasible, the pricing out of power ex ante coupled with a credible commitment against using power to influence behavior ex post is optimal not only from the weak firm's perspective but from the powerful firm's perspective as well.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This claim is challenging for managers, because to generate the highest initial price, the powerful firm must tie its own hands as a means of guaranteeing a favorable environment for the weaker firm ex post. We suspect that most managers of powerful firms would instead default to trying to exercise their power ex ante when setting the price <em>and</em> keeping their options open to influence behavior and bargaining ex post. However, this approach is suboptimal if the contracting environment allows them to credibly commit to not doing so. It is only when ex ante transfers are infeasible that the powerful firm should shift its focus ex post toward influencing partner behavior and realizing gains from bargaining.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Managers at weak firms, in turn, should expect to pay a higher price up front in exchange for more favorable, efficient conditions ex post. Here again, a shift in thinking from traditional power arguments is warranted—the weak firm should try to negotiate such an outcome rather than accept an inefficient arrangement on the grounds that it either reduces uncertainty ([21]) or sets parametric bounds on what the more powerful party can do ([50]). The weak firm should also exercise caution in relying on the self-enforcing aspects of the implicit or relational contract given the powerful firm's superior options ex post in the event of termination.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our prescriptions allow managers to understand a wide range of ways in which firms exercise their power. For example, the franchisee bills of rights included in many franchise arrangements at first appear to be at odds with the power of the franchisor. Viewed through the lens of traditional power theory, they call into question whether the franchisor's position is really dominant. Viewed through the lens of our theory, well-specified franchisee rights are a tool for the powerful franchisor to credibly commit to fair treatment of the franchisee ex post. This safeguards the franchisee's investment in the relationship and enables the franchisor to charge a higher up-front fee when the franchise agreement is constructed. This arrangement cannot be properly understood without considering both the contractual terms and the price mechanism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Managers can also benefit from realizing that, while the feasibility of arrangements involving credible commitments is primarily a function of the uncertainty surrounding the exchange, it is also subject to managerial influence and choice. For instance, more complete contracts can still be written in many "complex" situations at a cost ([10]; [55]). The first-best and second-best alternatives identified in this study suggest that the costs of writing more complete contracts ex ante may be justified, particularly in relationships involving powerful firms (see Figure 2), to support the greater efficiency associated with the pricing out of firm power.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, managers should consider the uncertainty that surrounds their focal task when making outsourcing decisions. More complex and uncertain tasks will tend to be governed less efficiently than simpler more programmable tasks in relationships involving powerful firms (see Figure 2). Thus, when powerful providers are involved, uncertain tasks at firm boundaries should be internalized to a greater extent, because powerful external providers will distort governance arrangements in their favor. Weaker providers, in contrast, allow more efficient outsourcing of even uncertain tasks, and smart outsourcing firms may recognize this when selecting partners and see the value of weaker firms. This may explain, in part, the highly fragmented nature of many industries providing outsourced services (in addition to conflict of interest issues). The fact that weaker firms are well advised to avoid powerful providers may present a barrier to the advancement of weaker outsourcing firms within their industries by deterring their involvement with leading providers.</p><a id="AN0136892984-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-32" title="Antitrust Implications">Antitrust Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also offer a brief consideration of the implications of our theory for antitrust policy, because the fundamental contrast between power (monopoly) and efficiency that we consider exactly mirrors the central debate in the antitrust literature. Antitrust regulation has historically focused on restricting the exercise and extension of monopoly power. Although the latter concern has been largely discredited in the academic literature absent the ability to price discriminate ([60]), it still plays a prominent role in court opinions and public policy discussions. As a result, so-called nonstandard modes of organization have been viewed by courts and regulators with extreme suspicion ([12]) due to the fundamental assumption that these nonstandard forms result from attempts to capitalize on firm power rather than efforts to enhance efficiency. The thrust of TCA (and new institutional economics more generally) has been quite different, with Williamson presenting compelling arguments against this "inhospitality tradition" (1985, p. 19) and suggesting that nonstandard arrangements other than cartels can serve "affirmative economic purposes" (1985, p. 200). The upshot of these arguments is that monopoly power should be less at play in determining nonstandard modes of organization than efficiency. As [53] observes, the Chicago-school approach to vertical restraints associated with Posner, Peltzman, and others is based on these same arguments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue for a nuanced view and suggest that the relative influence of power and efficiency rests on the ability of firms to price out their power differences ex ante. Absent this ability, powerful firms cause inefficiencies in channel governance. From an antitrust standpoint, the key observation is that the efficiency argument for nonstandard modes of organization serving affirmative economic purposes is undermined if governance is known to systematically deviate from efficiency in certain conditions as we illustrate. In particular, in highly uncertain environments, power leads to distortions in governance that favor the more powerful firm. Here, nonstandard arrangements involving powerful firms should rightly fall under suspicion—they cannot be presumed to support efficiency purposes. In contrast, in less uncertain conditions or when more evenly placed firms are involved (see Figure 2), even seemingly nonstandard arrangements are likely to support efficiency within the channel because this is the best option for all firms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The issue becomes one of analyzing the incentives of each party to implement an efficient agreement <em>and</em> the means by which powerful parties can be made whole when efficient arrangements work to their disadvantage, as we have shown that they do. Because TCA removes ex ante power as a main-case explanation of governance and glosses over the process by which firms with conflicting preferences arrive at efficient arrangements, it tends to provide an undiluted view of complex arrangements as efficiency enhancing.</p><a id="AN0136892984-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-33" title="Boundary Conditions and Limitations">Boundary Conditions and Limitations</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our framework is subject to several important boundary conditions. First, we assume that the institutional environment contains a well-functioning judiciary so that court ordering can be used to enforce the contractual commitments made. Otherwise, the powerful firm cannot price out its power using an ex ante contract, even under low uncertainty, because the weak firm cannot rely on enforcement of the contractual safeguard. In this case, power will have a larger influence on governance. This can be an important consideration in international relationships located in countries with a weak rule of law, which will be influenced more by power. In this case, either outsourcing firms would be unwilling to undertake value-enhancing investments specific to the CRO/vendor or, as a corollary, only powerful outsourcing firms with political connections would be willing to do so.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, relationships in our contexts are not embedded in repeated exchange; thus, the reputational feature of the shadow of the future is not available. If it were, it would allow joint value–maximizing governance to be adopted even when complete contracts could not be written. In this case, environmental uncertainty would have a limited influence on the <em>way</em> power is exercised. Importantly, relational exchange would not necessarily affect the <em>degree</em> to which power is exercised. Much as [37] observe a transfer of control consistent with the predictions of TCA even in the presence of relational norms, we would expect power to be exercised in highly relational exchanges because the powerful firm deserves a return on its unique resources. However, the powerful firm would not cause a departure from joint value–maximizing governance to do so and would exercise its power through the mutually agreed on price rather than through unilateral expropriations ex post.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the theory assumes that the interests of power and efficiency are at least partially at odds with each other. The assumption might not hold if the weak firm is not called on to make any specific investments and therefore does not require any safeguards. In this case, both power and efficiency will encourage either safeguards for the powerful firm if it makes a specific investment or simple market exchange (with power reflected in the price) if neither firm makes a specific investment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, our study focuses on contexts with one-sided exposed specific investments that give us a clear wedge to showcase the tension between power and efficiency. This is, however, <em>not</em> a boundary condition on the theory itself, which applies more generally, subject to the aforementioned considerations. In particular, the power of any focal party will tend to reduce the level of safeguards for the other party under incomplete contracting conditions because the price mechanism is not available to partial out the effect of power. It will do so to a lesser degree or not at all when more complete contracting is feasible.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Turning to limitations, we did not measure efficiency with a direct measure of costs, instead relying on a reduced-form analysis to show the effect of power on the safeguards predicted by efficiency theory. An attractive avenue for future research would be to directly address implications on governance costs. However, this would almost certainly require a focus on a single industry and other steps to standardize activities across observations so that costs are comparable. In addition, we would have to carefully separate the costs incurred ex post from the initial price. That is, we claim that power affects the ex post governance structure in certain circumstances and the price in others. When power shows up in the price, it is actually more efficient, yet the amount paid by the client/buyer is higher. This price could not, therefore, be taken as an indication of either cost or efficiency.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we abstracted away from the classic typology of [26] that is often used in the power literature, opting instead to define power in a straightforward manner based on scarcity. This is consistent with the long-standing view of monopoly power in economics and with [20] sociologically oriented dependence model. Scarcity is highly consistent with reward and coercive bases of power and, because it reflects the differential skills and resources of the CRO/vendor in our setting, it is also largely consistent with a basis in expertise. It would be informative to understand the roles played by other bases of power.</p><a id="AN0136892984-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892984-34" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919843914 - An Integrated Power and Efficiency Model of Contractual Channel Governance: Theory and Empirical Evidence</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919843914 for An Integrated Power and Efficiency Model of Contractual Channel Governance: Theory and Empirical Evidence by Stephen J.

This study builds on the cultural, economic, and structural differences across countries to examine how app popularity reacts to price and ratings, controlling for product characteristics. Estimated across 60 countries, a dynamic panel model with product-specific effects reveals that price sensitivity is higher in countries with higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. Ratings valence sensitivity is higher in countries with higher individualism and uncertainty avoidance, while ratings volume sensitivity is higher in countries with higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance and those that are richer and have more income equality. For managers, the authors visualize country groups and calculate how much price should decrease to compensate for a negative review or lack of reviews. For researchers, they highlight the moderators of the volume and valence effects of online ratings, which are becoming ubiquitous in this connected world.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">price sensitivity; rating sensitivity; mobile apps; dynamic panel model; Hofstede’s cultural factors</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">XML Full Text not available for this article.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By Raoul Kübler; Koen Pauwels; Gökhan Yildirim and Thomas Fandrich</p><div><hr width="25%" noshade="noshade"><span class="medium-normal">Copyright of Journal of Marketing is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources, thereby producing positive performance outcomes. However, building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory, the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm’s bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value, which, in turn, hurts profits. Using a sample of 1,023 initial public offerings (IPOs) and robust econometric methods, they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts IPO outcomes, but significantly hurts balance sheet–based outcomes (e.g., profitability). The results suggest that a 10% increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35% (or about $7 million) in the subsequent year, or 9.4% cumulatively over the next four years (or about $20.32 million). Further, the authors find that the negative effects of customer concentration decrease with increase in organizational (marketing, technological, and operational) capabilities and increase with low customer credit quality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Acquiring and managing customers is one of a firm’s most important tasks. Firms spend significant resources on managing customer relationships to create strong bonds with their customers. Such efforts are based on the premise that relationships with customers translate into improved customer loyalty and, in turn, superior organizational outcomes (Kumar, Luo, and Chintagunta 2011). Scholars have highlighted several benefits of having strong relationships with customers, such as reduced transaction costs and increased productivity. For example, Kalwani and Narayandas (1995) suggest that relationships with major customers improve firm performance by reducing discretionary expenses such as advertising and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) and by reducing costs through better inventory management. Similarly, such collaborative relationships can reduce transaction costs by developing interfirm norms and managing opportunism (Heide and John 1988). These benefits of customer relationships are especially important for young firms, which typically have limited resources and rely on such relationships to acquire external resources and exploit them for competitive advantage through new product creation, enhanced technological distinctiveness, and reduced sales costs (Yli-Renko, Autio, and Sapienza 2001). Customer relationships serve as valuable signals for the underlying quality of firms going public, who otherwise face significant information asymmetry due to their limited performance histories (Saboo and Grewal 2013).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, firms typically have relationships that can provide such benefits with only a small fraction of their customers because building relationships requires investment of scarce organizational resources. Thus, it is not surprising that firms spend disproportionate resources managing relationships with their key customers, often at the expense of other customers. Indeed, research across both B2B (e.g., Luo and Kumar 2013) and B2C (e.g., Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon 2001) domains has documented the “80/20” principle, where 20% of customers account for about 80% of revenues and, in turn, organizational efforts. In other words, firms tend to spend significant resources and build the strongest relationships with a small fraction of customers who spend the most with the firm (i.e., large purchase size), in the hopes of accruing all the benefits of selling to few large (in purchase size) customers. However, both anecdotal and academic research suggest that this small fraction of large customers can yield significant pressure on the supplier firm and bargain away all the joint value created (e.g., Heide and John 1988). Thus, organizational efforts to court large customers contrast with the negative consequences experienced by firms that have such customers. For example, although most firms strive to have Walmart as a key customer, these same firms complain about Walmart’s relentless pressure to squeeze profit-killing concessions and its effects on the entire operation from factory to financial statement (Fishman 2003). This is in line with Snyder (1996), who claims that large buyers have significant pricing power and can extract price concessions from suppliers and negatively affect their profitability. The vast literature on customer relationship management has argued for the benefits of allocating customer management resources according to the 80/20 principle (Luo and Kumar 2013; Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon 2001) and has largely overlooked the negative consequences of building strong customer relationships with only a small fraction of customers, an area to which we seek to contribute through this research. We propose that customer concentration that relates to the distribution of revenue over the firm’s customer base can provide some resolution to this conflict. Specifically, “high concentration” refers to a scenario wherein revenues are concentrated across a small group of customers or a few customers account for a large proportion of revenues, whereas “low concentration” refers to a scenario wherein revenues are distributed across customers and even large groups of customers contribute only a small proportion of revenues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on the industrial organizational literature, we argue that an increase in customer concentration, which reduces the supplier firm’s bargaining power relative to its customers, hurts the ability of the supplier firm to capture value and enables large customers to bargain away all the joint value created due to their superior bargaining position (Heide and John 1988; Porter 1980). Further, building on the seminal portfolio selection theory proposed by Markowitz (1952), we argue that the concentration of revenues among a handful of customers can increase the overall risk for the firm and hurt firm value. Having a small number of large customers (i.e., high customer concentration) exposes the firm to the idiosyncratic risks of individual customers and, in line with the portfolio theory, makes a firm inherently more vulnerable than a firm that derives revenues from a large number of customers (i.e., low customer concentration). In sum, we argue that customer concentration creates value, but it hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate the joint value created.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our primary objective in this research is to conceptualize and empirically demonstrate the importance of customer concentration as a variable that explains the conflicting consequences of having strong customer relationships.1 Prior studies have acknowledged the importance of customer concentration but have largely limited its use to characterizing the balance of power between the firm and its customers (e.g., Boyd, Chandy, and Cunha 2010; Nath and Mahajan 2011; Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal 2016). Our use of customer concentration as a measure of risks associated with the entire customer portfolio is most closely aligned with recent accounting studies by Patatoukas (2012) and Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016), who use a similar measure to examine the relationship between customer concentration, firm performance, and supplier risk. Our research is different from previous work on both conceptual and empirical grounds. Unlike prior studies, we investigate firms from the beginning of their life cycles and, thus, account for the initial conditions (or those at the time of inception) and examine both initial public offering (IPO)–based and balance sheet–based outcomes of customer concentration. Assessing these two related but fundamentally distinct outcomes allows us to examine the effect of customer concentration on both a stock market–based outcome that should be of interest to pre-IPO investors and an objective balance sheet–based accounting outcome that should be of interest to most of the stakeholders. Specifically, as we detail subsequently, we use market capitalization on the first trading day to measure IPO outcome; we use profitability to measure balance-sheet outcomes because profitability includes both costs and benefits of customer concentration. Our study also resolves the apparent conflict between Patatoukas (2012), who documents a positive effect of customer concentration, and Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016), who document a negative effect. Unlike prior studies, our study highlights and provides evidence of the underlying mechanism (asymmetry in bargaining power between suppliers and major customers and the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value) that drive the impact of customer concentration. Further, we highlight important boundary conditions for the effects of customer concentration. Finally, unlike prior research, we account for both potential endogeneity of concentration and unobserved heterogeneity in our estimation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of boundary conditions for the consequences of customer concentration, we incorporate two sets of moderators that reflect the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value from its customer relationships and the inherent quality of the supplier firm’s customer base to create such value. First, consistent with the relational view of competitive advantage that highlights learning as an important avenue for maximizing returns from interfirm relationships (Dyer and Singh 1998), we argue that firms can mitigate the deleterious consequences of concentration through their capabilities to learn from their major customers and use the learning to enhance existing customer relationships or acquire new customers; that is, organizational capabilities should moderate the relationship between customer concentration and firm performance. Further, in line with several studies (e.g., Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv 1999; Gerybadze and Reger 1999; Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008; Van den Bulte and Moenaert 1998) that define marketing, R&amp;D, and operations as the core functions that endow firms with demand and/or supply-side advantages, we argue that organizational marketing, technological, and operations capabilities should moderate the effect of customer concentration on firm value. Second, in line with the view that the value that a firm derives from its customers is a function of the underlying quality of its customer base, we include the credit quality of the supplier firm’s customer base. Low credit quality is an indicator of low-quality borrowers who may not possess the desired information about business processes, product characteristics, and marketplace challenges that the supplier firm desires. In general, these borrowers are unlikely to share this information with the supplier firm in order to conceal their true quality (Mishkin and White 2002). We borrow from the accounting and finance literature in suggesting that doubtful receivables, which relate to the ability of customers to repay debts, are a valid proxy of the credit quality of a firm’s customer base and include this quality as additional moderator.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We test our conceptual framework using a unique data set compiled from multiple sources for firms that went public during 2000–2011. Using IPO firms allows us to track customer concentration from the beginning of a firm’s (public) life cycle and examine the influence of concentration on both IPO-based and balance sheet–based outcomes. Recognizing that customer concentration can vary across industries and can be endogenous for a variety of reasons that we discuss subsequently, we use a random effects model that accounts for industry-specific effects and the control function approach to account for the potential endogeneity of customer concentration. We find that customer concentration benefits IPO outcomes but adversely affects supplier firms’ profitability. Furthermore, this negative effect of customer concentration is contingent upon both organizational core capabilities and quality of the supplier’s customer base. Specifically, organizational marketing, technological, and operational capabilities positively moderate the negative effects of customer concentration, whereas the negative effects of customer concentration increase with the decrease in customer credit quality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research contributes to the literature on customer relationship management (CRM) and dynamic capabilities. To the CRM literature, we introduce the idea of customer concentration as a resolution for the apparent conflict and consequences of having large customers. Our results suggest that although strong relationships with few customers can improve IPO outcomes, relying on a few major customers for revenues negatively impacts firm profitability. We also contribute to the literature on dynamic capabilities by demonstrating that organizational marketing, technological, and operational capabilities can mitigate the adverse effects of customer concentration (e.g., Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). To the literature on customer profitability (Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon 2001), we highlight that customers with low credit quality exacerbate the negative effects of customer concentration. Our research also contributes to the literature on the role of marketing in the context of IPOs (Luo 2008), in which investors view a concentrated customer base as a credible signal for firms’ survival and growth given the newness of young firms and uncertainty of their growth when they go public.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The rest of the article is organized as follows: First, we present an overview of the literature on customer concentration and develop our conceptual model, along with the contingency effects of organizational capabilities and customer credit quality, before proposing our hypotheses. Next, we present the methodology used to estimate the proposed effects and discuss our results and our robustness checks. Finally, we conclude with theoretical and practical implications of our research.</p><a id="AN0126087333-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-2" title="Conceptual Framework">Conceptual Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0126087333-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-3" title="Customer Concentration">Customer Concentration</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customers are probably the most important organizational assets, and firms spend significant resources on acquiring and managing their customers. This is in line with research on building strong relationships that emphasizes the need to maintain profitable long-term relationships with customers (Reinartz and Kumar 2000). To economize on relationship management efforts, firms tend to allocate resources to their most promising customers. Such efforts are consistent with the CRM literature that advocates targeting efforts toward a small fraction of customers who spend the most with the firm and have strong relationships (Kumar, Luo, and Chintagunta 2011). However, the effects on firm performance of having strong relationships with a small fraction of customers are mixed. For example, Luo and Kumar (2013) and Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon (2001) argue that strong customer relationships encourage information exchange and collaboration, improving profitability, whereas Christensen and Bower (1996) suggest that such relationships narrow the focus of these firms on the needs of their major customers and hurt firm performance. In this research, we argue that although having strong relationships with a small set of customers can have temporary benefits, such as when the firm is going public, relying on a few large customers or having strong relationships with only a few customers significantly hurts firm performance overall.

Thus, we propose customer concentration as a construct that measures the extent to which organizational revenues are distributed across customers as a potential explanation for the conflicting effects of strong customer relationships. We refer to firms with revenues evenly distributed across their customers as having low concentration and those that rely ona few customersfor the bulk of their revenues as having high customer concentration.</p><a id="AN0126087333-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-4" title="Customer Concentration and IPO Outcomes">Customer Concentration and IPO Outcomes</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firms with high customer concentration have fewer relationships to manage versus those with low concentration and, thus, can invest resources in these relationships to develop mutual trust and commitment, driving additional qualitative benefits such as lower conflict, uncertainty, and propensity to leave (Morgan and Hunt 1994). Strong customer relationships facilitate sharing of information and reduce costs through improved resource utilization and lower discretionary expenses such as SG&amp;A and overheads (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995). Similarly, major customers can help firms increase operational efficiency by streamlining order processing and inventory management (Parvatiyar and Sheth 2001). Major customers can also help firms expand their current customer base by spreading positive word of mouth (Reichheld and Teal 2001). Finally, customers can provide product ideas and be actively involved in codeveloping products (Gulati and Kletter 2005; Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007). Thus, customer concentration creates value by increasing purchase volume, positive word of mouth, coproduction, and, in general, reduced transaction costs. For IPO firms that lack performance history and face significant uncertainty about their viability and prospects, these benefits associated with high customer concentration can alleviate investor concerns in three ways. First, high concentration and the associated supplier–customer relationships can give investors a perception of stable cash flows that is typically lacking in young firms. Consistent with the literature on market-based assets (e.g., Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998) and customer equity of firms (Rust et al. 2004), strong relationships with customers and the corresponding benefits, such as reduced cost of marketing and access to valuable information and capabilities associated with such relations, should alleviate investor uncertainty. Second, these relationships with major customers serve as third-party endorsements and can signal the underlying quality of the IPO firm (Leland and Pyle 1977; Ritter 2011). Finally, these relationships serve as reservoirs of resources that the IPO firms can access to compensate for their lack of internal resources (Gulati and Higgins 2003). In sum, customer concentration can mitigate the liability of newness faced by IPO firms and reduce investor uncertainty (Bruderl and Schussler 1990), thereby improving IPO performance. Thus:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1: Increase in customer concentration is associated with increase in suppliers’ IPO performance.</p><a id="AN0126087333-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-5" title="Customer Concentration and Firm Profitability">Customer Concentration and Firm Profitability</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although having major customers reduces the liability of newness at the time of going public, we argue that having a concentrated customer base hurts the supplier firm’s ability to appropriate the value created to generate economic profits. The industrial organization literature suggests that organizational ability to capture value is influenced by its bargaining strength (Porter 1980). Thus, increase in customer concentration, which, by definition, reduces the supplier firm’s bargaining power relative to its customers (e.g., Boyd, Chandy, and Cunha 2010; Wang, Saboo, and Grewal 2015), should then hurt the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value. Further, in line with literature on power dependence that suggests that dependence in an exchange relationship makes the dependent party susceptible to the power and influence of the other party (Heide and John 1988), we argue that large customers can force the supplier firms to change their business practices and bargain away all the value created by demanding lower prices, frequent deliveries of small quantities, product customizations, and extended technical and marketing support (Galbraith 1952). Anderson and Weitz (1989) provide evidence that trust decreases with increasing interdependence asymmetry. Finally, major customers may hinder the growth of the supplier firm outside such relationships. Indeed, Christensen and Bower (1996) find that large customers demand significant resources toward their specific needs, making it difficult for the supplier firm to cater to the broader marketplace. In fact, Martin (1995, p. 121) strongly suggests that innovative firms must “ignore their customers.”</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moreover, increase in customer concentration implies increased reliance on a few customers for revenues, meaning loss of a few customers or even a single customer can significantly hurt firm performance. Forecast errors (or the difference between company projections and actual demand) tend to be higher when a small number of customers make large purchases (vs. many customers making small purchases) and result in excess inventories or lost sales (Chopra and Sodhi 2004). This is consistent with portfolio theory, which suggests that relying on a few customers for revenues significantly increases cash flow volatility and vulnerability and therefore increases the cost of capital or the discount rate (Srivastava, Shervani, and Fahey 1998). Furthermore, supplier firms are forced to offer cheap trade credits to large customers who exploit their monopsony power and threaten to switch suppliers (e.g., Brechling and Lipsey 1963) or willingly offer attractive trade credits to signal supplier commitment and financial health (e.g., Petersen and Rajan 1994), thereby increasing the cost of servicing such customers and the default risks. Indeed, Mian and Smith (1992) find evidence that customer concentration is significantly associated with accounts receivable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In sum, we argue that the costs associated with the increase in customer concentration are largely borne by the supplier, whereas major customers bargain away all the benefits (due to lack of bargaining power of the supplier). Thus, the costs of concentration outweigh its benefits, and this trade-off should be reflected in the objective balance sheet–based performance of the supplier firm. Thus:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2: Increase in customer concentration is associated with lower supplier firm profitability.</p><a id="AN0126087333-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-6" title="Moderating Effects of Organizational Capabilities">Moderating Effects of Organizational Capabilities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The preceding hypothesis suggests that costs associated with customer concentration, combined with the inability of the supplier firm to extract value from these customer relationships, hurts supplier performance. Thus, factors that influence organizational ability to appropriate value from such resources (customer relationship, in our context) should influence the effects of customer concentration. We draw on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm that argues for the importance of organizational capabilities to “integrate, build, and reconfigure” internal and external resources to create sustainable competitive advantage (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997, p. 516). Organizational capabilities are “complex bundles of skills and accumulated knowledge that enables firms to coordinate activities and make use of their assets” that is, they increase the productivity of other resources (Day 1994, p. 38). Accordingly, we suggest that capabilities should influence the outcomes of organizational resources; that is, capabilities should moderate the influence of customer concentration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Further, although each firm develops its own configuration of capabilities according to its competitive situation, we focus on three capabilities—marketing, technological, and operational—that have been documented as primary sources of organizational advantage (e.g., Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv 1999; Gerybadze and Reger 1999; Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008; Van den Bulte and Moenaert 1998). These three capabilities are the “core functional capabilities that contribute the most to firms’ ability to deliver value to customers and thereby create sustainable competitive advantage” (Feng, Morgan, and Rego 2016, p. 4). Our choice of these three capabilities is also consistent with the classification of outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities proposed by Day (1994). Specifically, marketing capability connects organizational processes to the external environment and enables firms to compete by anticipating market requirements and creating durable relationships with external stakeholders, (i.e., outside-in); operational capability emphasizes inside-out processes that include manufacturing and other transformation activities, such as logistics and cost management, that enable firms to transform inputs into output; and technological capability emphasizes spanning processes that integrate both inside-out and outside-in processes and includes activities like product development, strategy development, and so on. We discuss the moderating effects of each of these capabilities next.2</p><a id="AN0126087333-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-7" title="Marketing Capability">Marketing Capability</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Marketing capability refers to a firm’s ability to carry out both market sensing and customer linking activities that relate to understanding and anticipating customer requirements and linking the firm to its customers (Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008). It is based on a broad understanding of changes in market conditions, customer preferences, and the ability of the firm to respond to these changes; it enables firms to efficiently combine organizational resources to achieve marketing objectives. Marketing capability that involves tacit understanding of processes and relationships with customers is difficult to imitate and gives a competitive advantage to firms. Overall, increase in marketing capability enhances firm performance through improved market sensing and strong customer relationships (Day 1994).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that an increase in organizational marketing capability increases the ability of the supplier firm to extract value from its customer relationships in three ways. First, marketing capability enables firms to increase efficiency of their marketing investments by increasing customer loyalty and reducing customer management costs (Krasnikov and Jayachandran 2008). Moreover, increase in marketing capability allows supplier firms to establish stronger relationships with their customers, reducing the risk of customer churn. Since major customers provide a large portion of organizational revenues, the presence of such customers and close collaboration with them reduces marketing and advertising spending and aids knowledge acquisition, helping suppliers reduce retention costs and acquire new customers at lower costs. Thus, marketing capability directly reduces costs of customer acquisition and retention and enhances the profitability of existing marketing relationships. Second, by anticipating customer needs and developing products that meet (or exceed) their requirements, firms can increase customers’ dependence on the supplier firm. Such reduction in customer power can reduce the power imbalance between the two firms and allow the supplier firm to extract value from the relationship (e.g., LaBahn and Krapfel 2000). Finally, marketing capability allows firms to learn from their customers and cocreate knowledge that can be deployed broadly. For example, firms can integrate their customer-based insights in their new product development process to develop solutions that can be used by other customers, allowing the supplier to generate additional rents. In sum, marketing capability reduces the negative effects of customer concentration by increasing the ability of supplier firms to extract value from existing relationships and reducing the risks of customer churn. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3: Increase in marketing capability decreases the negative effects of customer concentration on suppliers’ profitability.</p><a id="AN0126087333-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-8" title="Technological Capability">Technological Capability</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Technological capability refers to a firm’s ability to develop and use internal technological resources along with other organizational resources to improve existing products or develop new ones in response to changing marketing conditions (Moorman and Slotegraaf 1999). It helps firms to rapidly respond to changing customer preferences as well as cater to other customers with similar needs. A stock of knowledge and technological resources helps supplier firms to be irreplaceable to their major customers and improves existing technological capabilities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ability of the supplier firm to use technological resources to develop new products and improve existing ones to gain competitive advantage should influence the benefits that the supplier firm derives from its customer relationships in two ways. First, in line with the literature on absorptive capacity that suggests that a firm’s ability to absorb new external knowledge largely depends on its existing knowledge bases (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Saboo et al. 2017), the ability of the supplier firm to learn from its customers should increase with increasing organizational technological capability. Major customers, who are often actively involved in codeveloping products, provide access to technology, systems, and processes that can be leveraged by the supplier firm to enhance its knowledge bases (Gulati and Kletter 2005). For example, Toyota allows a group of suppliers to visit its plants for knowledge sharing and joint problem solving (Dyer and Nobeoka 2000). Such access to external technological resources can also reduce the need for internal R&amp;D spending. In addition to utilization of joint capabilities for cocreation, suppliers also share risks with their major customers in case of new product failure, which generally has a high probability. Second, customers are vital sources of information on market trends, which is an essential ingredient for fruitful deployment of technological capability. Major customers are motivated to be a part of the innovation process and are often willing to share future projections with their suppliers (Lilien et al. 2002). Technological capability enables firms to combine this information on customers and markets and exploit it for commercial advantage. Enhanced understanding of technology, markets, and customer preferences is likely to strengthen the supplier’s ability to leverage other resources (e.g., Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv 1999; Moorman and Slotegraaf 1999). Moreover, developing products that anticipate and fulfill the technological needs of their customers enables suppliers to increase customer reliance on them and reduce the asymmetry of bargaining power in the relationship, allowing the supplier firm to generate additional value from the relationship (e.g., LaBahn and Krapfel 2000). In sum, technological capability reduces the negative effects of customer concentration by allowing supplier firms to benefit from existing customer relationships through knowledge acquisition from customers and, in turn, increasing knowledge exploitation. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4: Increase in technological capability decreases the negative effects of customer concentration on suppliers’ profitability.</p><a id="AN0126087333-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-9" title="Operational Capability">Operational Capability</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Operational capability refers to the ability of firms to coordinate and execute the tasks along the entire value chain required to transform the inputs to outputs, for example, logistics, inventory management, forecasting, distribution, and manufacturing (Cepeda and Vera 2007). Operational capability entails value chain flexibility, which requires integration with both customers and vendors and flexible production programs to compensate for changes in customer demands and fluctuations in raw material supply (Gelhard and Von Delft 2016). Thus, customer management is at the heart of operational capability, and firms use variety of techniques (e.g., just-in-time production, total quality management) to maintain long-term relationships with customers and improve operational efficiency through proactive problem solving. Overall, operations capability enhances new product success through efficient manufacturing, supply chain, and customer integration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that operational capability mitigates the negative effects of customer concentration in three broad ways. First, operational capability (and the corresponding relationship with customers and vendors) enables firms to lower their manufacturing costs through accurate demand forecasting, better inventory management, and improved production processes (Tan, Kannan, and Narasimhan 2007). Supplier firms can pass on these benefits to their concentrated customer bases and still make profit from their customer relationships due to their low costs. Moreover, these lower-cost offerings increase the attractiveness of the supplier, increasing customer dependence and reducing churn. Second, the flexibility in the manufacturing process allows supplier firms to offer a wide variety of products to cater to different customers and diversify their customer bases (Worren, Moore, and Cardona 2002). Flexible manufacturing processes reduce reliance on existing customers and increase firms’ ability to handle the wild demand fluctuations that can result from a concentrated customer base. Finally, operational capabilities should help firms with high customer concentration (or those with few major customers) by lowering the costs of customizing products for their smaller customer bases. For example, integrating RFID technology in a firm’s supply chain in response to Walmart’s demands allows the firm to offer the same technology to existing smaller and new customers. In sum, operational capability reduces the negative effects of customer concentration by reducing production costs and increasing manufacturing flexibility. Therefore:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5: Increase in operational capability decreases the negative effects of customer concentration on suppliers’ profitability.</p><a id="AN0126087333-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-10" title="Moderating Effect of Customer Credit Quality">Moderating Effect of Customer Credit Quality</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on the idea proposed by Kumar (2013) and Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon (2001) that not all customers are equal and that some customers are more valuable to the firm, we introduce the concept of customer credit quality, which refers to the financial well-being of customers and the risk of default. Customer credit quality is related to customers’ ability to pay back their suppliers and, in line with the general idea of credit quality (Petersen and Rajan 1997), is inherently linked to the underlying quality of the customer base. Low-quality customers are less likely to have the desired information about business processes, product characteristics, and marketplace challenges. Moreover, given that supplier firms extend trade credits according to their assessment of the quality and the future potential of their customers (Brennan, Miksimovic, and Zechner 1988), low-quality customers are unlikely to share their private information with supplier firms, to prevent the supplier firms from knowing their true quality (Mishkin and White 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that low customer credit quality exacerbates the negative effects of customer concentration in two ways. First, low customer credit quality directly amplifies the negative consequences of concentration as the risk of concentration is spread over a few low-quality customers. On average, low-quality customers have a high default risk and an increased likelihood of not being able to live up to their commitments, further increasing cash flow volatility and vulnerability and the overall cost of capital. Second, low credit quality indirectly hurts the supplier firm by locking in resources and preventing the supplier firm from pursuing other high-quality customers. Low-quality customers are fundamentally less equipped to learn from their environment and provide quality insights to the focal firm, making such relationships even less valuable (Dodgson 1993). In sum, low customer credit quality further deteriorates the negative relationship between customer concentration and firm performance. Therefore:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H6: As customer credit quality decreases, the negative effects of customer concentration on suppliers’ profitability increase; that is, the negative effect increases in magnitude with a decrease in customer credit quality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In sum, we expect a negative effect of customer concentration on firm profitability. Furthermore, we expect organizational capabilities to positively moderate and (low) customer credit quality to negatively moderate the relationship between customer concentration and profitability. We summarize our conceptual framework in Figure 1.</p><a id="AN0126087333-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-11" title="Data and Sample">Data and Sample</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We test our framework using data from IPO firms, which provide an ideal context to test our framework because we can track them from the initial stages of their life cycle. Focusing on young IPO firms also allows us to observe the supplier firm from the initial phase of relationships with all its customers, account for the evolution of concentration in its customer base, and eliminate any bias due to suppliers’ preexisting knowledge about its customers. Although we do not observe these relationships from inception, our use of firm age as a proxy of relationship age is consistent with Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016, p. 893), who suggest that “young firms tend to have young relationships with their major customers” and that “firm age contains enough information on relationship duration” to be used instead of relationship age. More importantly, focusing on IPO firms allows us to evaluate both IPO-based and balance sheet–based outcomes and, thus, to examine the consequences of customer concentration from both stock market and accounting perspectives and provide a complete understanding of the influence of customer concentration. Accordingly, we collected information for all firms that went public between 2000 and 2011. The 12-year window is long enough to provide adequate variability in terms of periods of boom and bust, to make generalizable claims over a large sample, and to allow us to track the long-term (four years post-IPO) performance of these firms. We obtained the list of IPOs from the SDC Platinum New Issues Database. In line with prior literature (Luo 2008; Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal 2016), we excluded secondary offerings, spin-offs, leveraged buyouts, rights issues, closed-ended funds, and limited partnerships, to obtain our initial sample of 1,483 firms. After excluding 326 financial services firms (SIC 6000–6999), 79 very small issues (less than $1.5 million in proceeds), and 55 IPOs with extensive missing information, we obtain our sample of 1,023 IPO firms across 54 industries (two-digit SIC codes). Combining the concentration information with other financial controls from Compustat and patent information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office resulted in an unbalanced panel with 7,008 firm-year observations.</p><a id="AN0126087333-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-12" title="Measures">Measures</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0126087333-13"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-13" title="Independent Variables">Independent Variables</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer concentration. Customer concentration (CC) measures how a firm’s revenues are distributed across its customers, which is analogous to the Herfindahl index that measures the concentration of industry revenues across firms. Accordingly, we measure customer concentration as the sum of square of revenue share from major customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all publicly listed firms to disclose information through prefiling Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 14 (SFAS 131 after 1997) disclosures on customers that account for more than 10% of firm revenue contributions; these statements are available in the Compustat segments database.3 However, Compustat customer information is only available for post-IPO years and often lacks information. Therefore, we supplement the Compustat segment information with data on customer concentration that we manually collected from the IPO prospectus and 10-K filings. Specifically, we looked for phrases such as “key customers,” “significant customers,” and “major customers,” and we looked in the customer section of the filings to find the customer-level information. For firms that did not use any of these phrases, we manually searched the entire filings for the relevant information. IPO firms reveal their historical financial information in their IPO prospectuses, covering a period either since their inception or at least for the recent past, typically at least for 5 years prior to the offering. The manual data collection allows us to obtain concentration information for the firms since inception.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, in line with extant research (Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan 2016; Patatoukas 2012), we measure customer concentration CCit for firm I having j = 1, 2, …, N customers in period t as ? ?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, customer concentration of a firm ranges from 1/N, or 0 as N → ‘ (where revenues are evenly distributed across a very large number of customers), to 1 (where all the revenues are derived from a single customer). We provide a time trend series of customer concentration in Figure 2, showing adequate variation in both number of firms going public every year and the levels of customer concentration across years. Figure 3 provides the distribution of the number of major customers and highlights that firms typically have few major customers and that the number of major customers declines rapidly. Figure 4 provides the evolution of concentration over firm age and documents that customer concentration reduces as firms mature. These figures highlight the need for understanding of the dynamics of customer concentration.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Marketing capability. We follow the extant literature and use an input–output stochastic frontier approach to measure ? ? marketing capability (Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv 1999; Xiong and Bharadwaj 2013). The stochastic frontier analysis estimates the inefficiency scores based on the firm’s ability to transform inputs into outputs; it has been widely used to measure organizational capabilities (e.g., Feng, Morgan, and Rego 2015). To estimate marketing capability, we follow Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv (1999) and Feng, Morgan, and Rego (2016) and include total sales as output and the following quantities as marketing-resource inputs: (<a id="bib1up

We also add industry dummies to control for industry-level heterogeneity. Formally, we write the frontier model as follows: ? ?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where Saleit is total sales; SGAit is SG&amp;As; Receivit is total accounts receivables of firm I in year t; Indi and Yeart are industry and year dummies, respectively; eM it ~ Nð0, s2eM Þ is idiosyncratic error; and hM it ~ ExpðqMÞ is a marketing ineffi-ciency error component, which is exponentially distributed with qM &gt; 0, hM 0, and E½eMit, hMit = 0. We derive the measure of marketing capability from the maximum likelihood estimate of the inefficiency term hM it (such that higher inefficiency means lower marketing capability) and rescale the measure between 0 (lowest) and 100 (highest) for ease of interpretation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Technological capability. Technological capability refers to organizational ability to convert technological resources into technological output. In line with the extant literature, we measure technological output of a firm using patent count, which has been widely established as a valid measure of organizational innovativeness (Feng, Morgan, and Rego 2016). However, to account for the extraneous factors (e.g., processing delays, legal challenges) and closely relate the patent output to firm’s R&amp;D ? ? expenses, we use the filing date, rather than the patent issue date, to relate the R&amp;D investments to patent output (e.g., Acharya and Subramanian 2009; Chava et al. 2013). Further, given that several technological resources have persistent (long-term) effects and that recent resource allocations are more valuable than those in the past (e.g., Xiong and Bharadwaj 2013), we use Koyck lag function for patent counts and R&amp;D expenditure with higher weights on recent years. We follow Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv (2005) in using Koyck lagged structure with associated weights of .4 for both variables. In additional analyses, we try different weights ranging from .4 to .7 and find qualitatively similar results.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also control for industry-level heterogeneity among firms by adding industry dummies. Consistent with our estimation of marketing capability, we write the frontier model as follows: ? ?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where Innovit is innovation output, or patent count, of firm I in year t; R&amp;DStockit is stock of R&amp;D expenses; PatentStockit is stock of patent output of firm I in year t; Indi and Yeart are industry and year dummies, respectively; eT it ~ Nð0, s2eT Þ is idiosyncratic error; and hT it ~ ExpðqTÞ is a technological inefficiency error component, which is an exponential distribution with qT &gt; 0, hT 0, and E½eTit, hTit = 0.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">? ? ?

Formally, we write the frontier model as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where XOPRit is operational expenses; Assetsit is current assets; PPEGTit is property, plant and equipment; EMPit is number of employees; INDi and Yeart are industry and year dummies, respectively; eO it ~ Nð0, s2eO Þ is idiosyncratic error; and hO it ~ ExpðqOÞ is an operational inefficiency error component, which is an exponential distribution with qO &gt; 0 and hO it 0: Unlike marketing and technological capabilities, for which we use production maximization, operational capability is estimated as a cost-minimization problem, and, thus, inefficiency hO it is added to the equation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Further, given that these three organizational capabilities may be related to one another due to unobserved factors (e.g., overall capability of the firm), we estimate them jointly.4 Specifically, we use a Bayesian estimation with a multivariate normal idiosyncratic error structure to allow for correlated errors. We run a Markov chain Monte Carlo of 50,000 iterations for the models to converge and obtain the capabilities estimates after 10,000 burn-ins, which we then use in our final model.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer credit quality. Customer credit quality refers to the financial health of the supplier’s customer base. In line with the accounting and finance literature (e.g., Cunat 2007; Petersen and Rajan 1997; Sopranzetti 1998), we use doubtful receivables (i.e., a portion of account receivables that has a high probability of becoming a bad debt in the future) as measure of the credit quality of a supplier’s customer base. Note that delays in payment alone (which are common for large customers) do not reflect low customer credit quality. For example, customers such as Walmart often pay their suppliers after some time (i.e., trade financing); however, there is very low probability of receivables from these customers turning into bad debt, and thus they are not considered doubtful receivables. We measure customer credit quality as the two-year average of the ratio of doubtful receivables to total account receivables, where a lower number represents superior credit quality of customer base (Sopranzetti 1998). We use the log-transformed variable to reduce the skewness (Danaher, Mullarkey, and Essegaier 2006).</p><a id="AN0126087333-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-14" title="Dependent Variable">Dependent Variable</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In line with extant research in the IPO domain (e.g., Gulati and Higgins 2003; Megginson and Weiss 1991), to measure IPO outcome, we use market capitalization (MCap), measured as the total outstanding shares multiplied by the closing price obtained from CRSP, of the IPO firm at the end of the first trading day.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To evaluate the balance sheet–based consequences of customer concentration, consistent with our objective of investigating the influence of the risks and rewards of having a concentrated customer base, and in line with extant research on ? ? customer concentration (e.g., Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan 2016; Patatoukas 2012), we use firm profitability as our dependent variable. Unlike other measures such as sales or cash flows, profitability reflects both the costs and benefits associated with customer concentration and, thus, is the most appropriate measure in our context. For example, profitability includes the benefits of customer concentration, such as lower marketing costs and learning from customers, as well as the risks of customer attrition or low margins due to the supplier firm’s lack of bargaining power. Specifically, we use return on assets (ROA), measured as the ratio of net income to total assets obtained from Compustat.</p><a id="AN0126087333-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-15" title="Control Variables">Control Variables</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For our IPO outcome analysis, in line with the recent IPO literature (see recent reviews by Ljungqvist 2007; Ritter 2011, 2003; Ritter and Welch 2002; Yong 2007), we include IPO-related and firm-specific control variables to account for the range of factors that influence IPO performance. Specifically, we include price adjustment (i.e., the revision in the offer price from the midpoint of the original filed price range), which accounts for the private information gathered during the road show (Ritter 2011); and percentage width of offer range (ratio of offer width to lower offer price), which accounts for uncertainty in setting the price (i.e., wider offer range provides greater price flexibility; Hanley 1993). Further, we also control for underwriter reputation, which has been documented as a credible signal of the quality of IPO firm, and we use the scores provided by Loughran and Ritter (2004) and ownership dilution (operationalized as amount of equity stake that owner managers relinquish at the time of IPO), which provide insights into the managers’ valuation of the IPO (Leland and Pyle 1977). Finally, we include dummy variables to account for whether the IPO was backed by venture capitalists and whether firm went public during the bubble period (Saboo and Grewal 2013). In addition to the IPO-specific controls, we also control for firm-specific variables, such as sales, ROA, firm age, number of major customers, number of business segments, and marketing intensity. Finally, we include both industry and year dummies to account for industry- and time-specific trends.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to our focal variables, we control for a range of industry- and firm-level financial factors that may influence firm performance. Specifically, we control for firm size (sales and total assets) to account for the scale economies, and age (firm age) to account for the maturity of the firm (e.g., Saboo and Grewal 2013). We include sales growth to account for recent firm performance (Slater and Narver 1994). We also control for firms’ marketing intensity (ratio of SG&amp;A expenses to total assets) to account for firms’ emphasis on building market-based assets, such as brand equity and customer equity, which affects firm performance (Rust et al. 2004). We use the log transformation of sales, age, and assets to reduce the skewness (Danaher, Mullarkey, and Essegaier 2006). Firms also face risks from concentration of revenues across a few business segments, especially IPO firms that typically operate in few business segments. Accordingly, we include the number of business segments that the supplier firm operates in, obtained from the Compustat segments database. Our bargaining power ? ? argument for the negative consequences of customer concentration relies on having a few dominant customers. However, given that our measure of concentration does not distinguish between the number of customers and the level of dependence (we disentangle the two in a subsequent robustness check), we include the number of customer relationships that the supplier firm has to maintain (breadth; see Figure 3).5 Given that our sample comes from multiple industries, we control for the competitive intensity using the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), which measures industry concentration (sum of squared market shares for all firms in the industry) according to two-digit SIC codes (Feng, Morgan, and Rego 2015). Further, given that industries may offer differential growth opportunities, we also control for the industry growth rates (Russo and Fouts 1997). In addition to the aforementioned controls, we include both industry and year fixed effects to account for industry-level and time-specific unobserved heterogeneity.

Using an autoregressive model, that is, including the lagged measure of profitability, allows us to control for past levels of ROA and other factors, including inertia, persistence, and different initial conditions, that can predict future ROA (Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal 2016). In the additional analyses related to the robustness checks, we estimate the consequences of customer concentration on firm profitability up to year t + 4. To correct for the dynamic panel bias introduced by the presence of a lagged dependent variable, we use lagged differences in dependent variables as instruments (Blundell and Bond 1998), where we first regress ROAi, t+1 on DROAi, t and take the predicted values as an instrument to control for profitability in the last period. We include both the industry (two-digit SIC code) and year dummies to control for industry and year fixed effects on profitability. Finally, we use a random effects specification that also helps us to account for unobserved heterogeneity and use cluster of robust standard errors that account for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.6 Overall, our final model can be written as</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where ROAit+1 is the return on assets of firm I at time t + 1, CC is customer concentration, MktCap is marketing capability, TechCap is technological capability, OprCap is operations capability, LogCredQual is the natural logarithm of credit quality of the customer base, breadth is the number of major customer relationships, BusSeg is the number of business segments in which a firm operates, and the idiosyncratic error eit+1 is normally and independently distributed. Figure 5, Panel B, provides the model-free evidence of the relationship between CC and ROA, and the significant negative correlation between CC and ROA (r = -.08) provides preliminary evidence for our arguments that an increase in customer concentration hurts profitability. ? ?</p><a id="AN0126087333-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-17" title="Endogeneity Correction">Endogeneity Correction</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given the importance of customers for firm performance, it is not surprising that managers spend significant resources on acquiring and managing their customers.

To correct for endogeneity in our model, we use the control function approach widely used in marketing (Petrin and Train 2010). In the first step, we regress the potentially endogenous variable, customer concentration, on a set of exogenous variables.

Given the inherent uncertainty about the right levels of customer concentration, in line with institutional isomorphism theory (DiMaggio and Powell 1983), we argue that firms often imitate their peers. Mimicking other firms is also consistent with other related theories of industry recipes (Spender 1989), industry mindset (Phillips 1994), and dominant logic (Bettis and Prahalad 1995). Moreover, average concentration in the same industry or across similar firms has little to do with the performance of the focal firm and is unlikely to serve its specific needs. Thus, average industry-level customer concentration (IndCC) and average customer concentration of firms with similar profitability (PeerCC) satisfy both criteria of relevance and exogeneity, to serve as valid instruments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because the dependent variable of our first-stage endogeneity correction model, customer concentration, is constrained between 0 and 1, and because both boundaries have a significant probability mass, we cannot use the regular regression techniques that rely on the normal functional form for estimation (Papke and Wooldridge 1996). Therefore, we use fractional response panel methods where E ðyjXÞ = GðXbÞ such that G(.) is a nonlinear function satisfying 0 £ G($) £ 1 (Papke and Wooldridge 2008; Ramalho, Ramalho, and Murteira 2011).

Further, customer concentration decreases with firm age (b = -.054, p &lt; .1), indicating that firms increase their customer base as they mature and no longer depend on a few customers for their revenues. Moreover, organizational marketing investments are negatively related to customer concentration (b = -.001, p &lt; .001), suggesting that marketing investments enable firms to acquire new customers and increase revenues from their customers to lower their concentration. Similarly, customer concentration decreases with an increase in the number of business segments that the firm operates in (b = -.174, p &lt; .01).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/63n1.jpg" alt="63n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 2 First-Stage Endogeneity Correction Results"><em>TABLE: TABLE 2 First-Stage Endogeneity Correction Results</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">Estimate</th><th valign="top">SE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Average CC of firms in the same industry (IndCC)</td><td valign="top">2.642***</td><td valign="top">.290</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Average CC of firms with similar profitability (PeerCC)</td><td valign="top">1.288***</td><td valign="top">.335</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Marketing capability (MktCap)</td><td valign="top">-.001</td><td valign="top">.002</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Technological capability (TechCap)</td><td valign="top">-.0001</td><td valign="top">.001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Operational capability (OprCap)</td><td valign="top">.020*</td><td valign="top">.011</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log customer credit quality (LogCredQual)</td><td valign="top">.002</td><td valign="top">.006</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales growth</td><td valign="top">-.155</td><td valign="top">.263</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log age (LogAge)</td><td valign="top">-.054*</td><td valign="top">.031</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log sales (LogSale)</td><td valign="top">.005</td><td valign="top">.013</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Competitive intensity</td><td valign="top">-.621***</td><td valign="top">.181</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Industry sales growth</td><td valign="top">-.001</td><td valign="top">.005</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Marketing intensity (MktInten)</td><td valign="top">-.001***</td><td valign="top">.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log assets (LogAssets)</td><td valign="top">-.110</td><td valign="top">.182</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of business segments</td><td valign="top">-.174***</td><td valign="top">.055</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">ROAit</td><td valign="top">.015</td><td valign="top">.045</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Intercept</td><td valign="top">-1.474***</td><td valign="top">.185</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">*p &lt; .1 (two-tailed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">***p &lt; .01 (two-tailed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We present the results of IPO performance analysis (Equation 5) in Table 3. In line with H1, we find that customer concentration is positively related to the market capitalization of the IPO firm (b = .814, p &lt; .05), indicating that IPO investors reward firms that have large stable customer relationships. We also replicated our analysis with initial returns (i.e., percentage difference between the offer price of the stock and the price of the stock at the end of the first trading day), another popular measure for assessing IPO and find qualitatively similar results (b = .126, p &lt; .05). We hasten to highlight that this positive effect should not be treated as IPO investors ignoring the costs associated with customer concentration. Given the information asymmetry and the uncertainty associated with the prospects of a firm going public, IPO investors are primarily concerned about the survival of the firm, and they value signals that reduce the risks associated with the firm’s prospects (e.g., Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal 2016). In such a context, having a steady stream of revenue that is associated with high concentration reduces investors’ uncertainty. The coefficients of the control variable are along expected directions (Luo 2008; Saboo and Grewal 2013). For example, IPO valuations increase with increases in price adjustment (b = 1.742, p &lt; .001), underwriter reputation (b = .041, p &lt; .01), marketing intensity (b = .284, p &lt; .01), and total assets (b = .001, p &lt; .01); valuations decrease with an increase in the offer range (b = -.828, p &lt; .01).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/63n2.jpg" alt="63n2.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 3 Parameter Estimates for the IPO Performance Model"><em>TABLE: TABLE 3 Parameter Estimates for the IPO Performance Model</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">Estimate</th><th valign="top">SE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Customer concentration (CC)</td><td valign="top">.805**</td><td valign="top">.389</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Partial adjustment</td><td valign="top">1.712***</td><td valign="top">.319</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Offer range width</td><td valign="top">-.908***</td><td valign="top">.267</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Underwriter reputation</td><td valign="top">.037***</td><td valign="top">.011</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bubble</td><td valign="top">.082</td><td valign="top">.104</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Venture capital funded</td><td valign="top">-.062</td><td valign="top">.043</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ownership dilution</td><td valign="top">-.642***</td><td valign="top">.131</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log age (LogAge)</td><td valign="top">-.052**</td><td valign="top">.024</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log sales (LogSale)</td><td valign="top">.01</td><td valign="top">.006</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Marketing intensity (MktInten)</td><td valign="top">.250***</td><td valign="top">.081</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Log assets (LogAssets)</td><td valign="top">.001***</td><td valign="top">.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of business segments</td><td valign="top">-.127***</td><td valign="top">.035</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Number of major customers ROA</td><td valign="top">-.051</td><td valign="top">.035</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RAO</td><td valign="top">.021</td><td valign="top">.073</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Endogeneity correction term ^qit</td><td valign="top">-.468</td><td valign="top">.340</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Intercept</td><td valign="top">-.281</td><td valign="top">.196</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Industry fixed effects</td><td valign="top" colspan="2">Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Year fixed effects</td><td valign="top" colspan="2">Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">**p &lt; .05 (two-tailed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">***p &lt; .01 (two-tailed).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Table 4, we report the results of our analyses of the consequences of customer concentration on firm profitability that control for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity. As expected, we find that the estimate of our correction (residuals from the first-stage model) term is significant (b = 2.625, p &lt; .01), suggesting that firms do strategically choose the desired level of customer concentration. As hypothesized in H2, we find that customer concentration hurts firm performance (b = -6.258, p &lt; .001), suggesting that the costs associated with having major customers easily outweigh their benefits. We perform a robustness check with contemporaneous variables (both ROA and CC in the same period) and obtain qualitatively similar results (b = -8.527, p &lt; .05).Our results are consistent with Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016), who also document a negative relationship between customer concentration and firm performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our results provide strong support for the moderating effects of organizational capabilities (see Figure 6). Specifically, in line with H3–H5, we find that marketing (b = .025, p &lt; .001), technological (b = .010, p &lt; .01), and operational capabilities (b = .311, p customer concentration. In line with H6, we find that poor customer credit quality further deteriorates performance of supplier firms (b = -.032, p &lt; .01). Although all three organizational capabilities are important in mitigating the negative effects of customer concentration, we evaluate their relative importance by comparing the magnitudes of the standardized interaction coefficients. The results show that operations capability (bSTD = .141, p &lt; .01) is more important than marketing (bSTD = .086, p &lt; .001) and technological (bSTD = .043, p &lt; .01) capabilities in reducing the negative effects of customer concentration.

To disentangle the effects of these two dimensions of customer concentration, we replicate our analysis using the breadth and depth of customer concentration on firm performance. To deal with the potential endogeneity of breadth and depth of the customer base, we use the control function approach (as detailed earlier) with industry averages of customer breadth and customer depth, respectively. We find that the depth of customer relationships has a negative effect on firm performance (b = -2.563, p &lt; .001), whereas customer breadth has no effect (b = .019, p &gt; .80). Further, we also find that that marketing (b = .019, p &lt; .001), technological (b = .008, p &lt; .01), and operational capabilities (b = .202, p &lt; .01) reduce the adverse effects of depth of customer concentration on profitability.

An increase in the depth of customer relationships increases the bargaining power of the customers, enabling them to command an increased share of the value created; breadth of customer concentration alone, however, should not influence bargaining power.</p><a id="AN0126087333-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-24" title="Robustness Tests">Robustness Tests</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We carried out several additional analyses to ensure the robustness of our results.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">How long does the negative effect persist? Our results indicate that the effect of customer concentration negatively affects firm performance in the subsequent period, while organizational capabilities mitigate these negative effects. Given the importance of long-term profitability of organizational strategies and decisions, we are interested in finding out how long the negative consequences of customer concentration persist. To answer this question, we estimate the model in Equation 6 with additional future profitability measures: ROAit+2, ROAit+3, and ROAit+4. In all the models, we also account for the dynamic panel bias by using appropriate instruments for each period as discussed earlier. We find that the effect of customer concentration is negative for period t + 2 (b = -6.975, p &lt; .001) and period t + 3 (b = -3.475, p &lt; .001), and this effect persists until period t + 4 (b = -3.256, p &lt; .001). Results of the interaction effects are also along expected lines in all the cases.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stock market–based buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHAR). Our two measures, market capitalization and profitability, examine the consequences of customer concentration from both stock market and accounting perspectives and provide a better understanding of the influence of customer concentration. Specifically, our results suggest that pre-IPO investors care about IPO outcomes, whereas other investors care about general well-being of the firm and therefore value balance sheet–based performance outcomes. However, one could argue that IPO outcome is a forward-looking stock market–based measure, whereas ROA is a backward-looking accounting metric. To document the robustness of our results, we replicate our balance sheet–based results using BHAR as the dependent variable. We compute buy-and-hold abnormal returns between two events as the difference between the buy-and-hold return of the stock and the buy-and-hold return of the benchmark, that is,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similar to our ROA analyses, we compute BHAR for each of the four years post-IPO (depending on the data availability; for many firms, we compute BHAR beyond four years) and reestimate the model in Equation 6 with BHAR. This variable measures the abnormal return from holding the stock for an extended period and is a widely used measure of long-term outcomes (Srinivasan and Hanssens 2009). Unlike ROA, which is available for pre-IPO years, a stock market–based measure is available only after the stock starts trading, resulting in a loss of 2,796 observations; thus, we do not use BHAR as our primary dependent variable. Consistent with our results, we find that customer concentration negatively influences long-term BHAR (b = -.811, p &lt; .05), providing confidence in our results.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternate model specifications. We estimated and compared our model with several other benchmark models. Specifically, the proposed model (Akaike information criterion [AIC] = 1,2971.4) is superior to alternate specifications such as models with only control variables (AIC = 13,333.9), only endogeneity correction and no correction for heterogeneity (AIC = 13,116.6), and only correction for unobserved heterogeneity and no endogeneity correction (AIC = 13,116.7). We also explored the nonmonotonic effects of customer concentration and reestimated both our models (Equations 5 and 6) to test for the quadratic effects of customer concentration. We obtain results qualitatively similar to those reported earlier and find no evidence of quadratic effect of customer concentration on market capitalization (b = -.191, p &gt; .6) or ROA (b = .184, p &gt; .4).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, using the estimated residual in our second stage can induce measurement error.7 To account for this, we replicated our second-stage model with bootstrapped standard errors; we obtain results qualitatively similar to those reported earlier.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternate variable operationalization. We check the robustness of our results by using alternate specifications for our measures of organizational capabilities. Specifically, we use different variables to specify our input–output stochastic frontier. For marketing capability, for instance, we add lags of variables and use advertising expenditures (SG&amp;A -R&amp;D) as inputs, and we obtain identical results to those reported here. We also try using different lagged variables for estimating operations and technological capabilities and confirm the robustness of our results.</p><a id="AN0126087333-25"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-25" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer management is one of the most important tasks that firms face, and managers spend significant resources developing strong relationships with their customers in an effort to increase purchases. However, our research highlights the downsides associated with strengthening relationships with only a small group of customers. We introduce the idea of customer concentration, which relates to the distribution of revenues across customers, to argue that instead of focusing on maximizing revenues from individual customers, managers must optimize their revenues across the entire customer base. Despite the convenience and potential benefits of managing fewer relationships (per H1), we highlight that having a concentrated customer base wherein the revenues are derived from a small group of customers has a significant negative effect on firm profitability. Large customers, who are aware of their strong bargaining position relative to the supplier firm, can extract all the joint value created and leave the supplier firm exposed to all the idiosyncratic risk associated with a concentrated customer base, hurting supplier profitability. We acknowledge the fact that firms (especially young firms, such as those in our sample) may not have much flexibility or choice in terms of level of customer concentration; however, the objective of our research is to sensitize managers about the deleterious consequences of relying on a few customers for their revenues. Further, our results suggest that the negative effects of customer concentration increase with a decrease in the credit quality of the supplier’s customer base and decrease with an increase in suppliers’ marketing, technological, and operational capabilities.</p><a id="AN0126087333-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-26" title="Theoretical and Empirical Contributions">Theoretical and Empirical Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customer acquisition and management has been a topic of significant research in marketing, yet this stream of research has largely focused on the strength of the individual supplier– customer relationship (Palmatier et al. 2006; Reinartz, Krafft, and Hoyer 2004; Reinartz and Kumar 2000; Ryals 2005). Our research contributes to CRM research in multiple ways. First, we highlight the importance of focusing on the entire customer base as allocating resources to maximize individual relationships with a small fraction of customers may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Our research should not be viewed as contradicting the volumes of research in the CRM domain; instead, we seek to highlight the risks of narrowly focusing on a few individual customer relationships, and we and encourage both theory and practice to look at the entire portfolio of customers. Second, we introduce the notion of customer concentration, which should allow scholars to better quantify the relationship between the firm and its customer base. Instead of dummy variables that prior research has used, such as customer power, CMO power, or customer dependence (e.g., Boyd, Chandy, and Cunha 2010; Christensen and Bower 1996; Wang, Saboo, and Grewal 2015), we hope that scholars use the customer concentration measure, which provides a nuanced understanding of the dynamics between firms and their customers. Third, we provide a resolution to the conflicting evidence provided by scholars on the consequences of having a concentrated customer base. For example, Patatoukas (2012) finds a positive effect of concentration on supplier performance, whereas Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016) find that the effect is negative in the initial phases of buyer–supplier relationships and becomes positive as the relationship matures. Using a large sample of 1,023 IPO firms wherein we observe customer concentration from the beginning of their life cycles and therefore reduce any bias due to prior experience in customer management, our results highlight that the relationship is not so straightforward and that although customer concentration is viewed positively by pre-IPO investors and helps IPO outcomes, it hurts the overall financial well-being of the firm by hurting profitability over multiple periods. In other words, whereas Irvine, Park, and Yildizhan (2016) show a positive effect on profitability in the long-run, we observe the opposite. Our negative main effect of customer concentration supports the argument made by Slater and Narver (1998) that firm strategy should not be customer-led and is consistent with the literature on power dependence (e.g., Heide and John 1988), which suggests that ability to appropriate value in an exchange relationship is a function of the relative bargaining power of the firm, and financial portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952), which argues for diversifying the customer base to reduce idiosyncratic customer risk. Furthermore, our negative moderating effect of customer credit quality provides additional justification for managing the overall portfolio of customer and even firing “bad customers” (Zeithaml, Rust, and Lemon 2001). Low-quality customers may not only directly hurt the firm value through reduced profitability, but they also consume precious organizational resources and prevent the supplier firm from pursuing high-quality customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To the emerging literature on the role of marketing during IPOs (e.g., Luo 2008; Saboo and Grewal 2013), we highlight another marketing construct that influences IPO outcomes. Having a set of core customers significantly reduces the liability of newness associated with young firms and increases investor confidence in the IPO firm. Thus, customer concentration serves as a credible signal of IPO firm quality and affects market capitalization positively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, to the resource-based view literature, we highlight the indirect benefits of organizational capabilities and their relative importance (Amit and Schoemaker 1993). First, we highlight the value of organizational capabilities in enabling firms to amplify the benefits and diminish the costs associated with organizational actions. In line with prior studies that highlight the moderating effects of organizational capabilities (e.g., Grewal and Tansuhaj 2001), we find that the effects of a concentrated customer base are contingent upon organizational capabilities. Specifically, we find that marketing, technological and operational capabilities mitigate the negative effects of customer concentration on firm performance. Second, we document the relative importance of operational capability over technological and marketing capabilities in terms of mitigating the deleterious effects of customer concentration. Specifically, our results suggest that firms that emphasize operational capability are better equipped to mitigate the risks of customer concentration than those that emphasize marketing and technological capabilities.</p><a id="AN0126087333-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-27" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our results are also managerially relevant. First, to managers who spend significant resources on increasing customer purchases, our results highlight the negative consequences of such efforts. Although customer concentration can serve as a credible signal of quality for firms going public, we hope to sensitize managers against relying on a small group of customers for their revenues. Given the average market capitalization of $633.6 million among our sample firms, our results for the effects of concentration on IPO outcomes suggest that a 10% increase8 in customer concentration (which, for a firm having two customers each contributing 40% of the revenues, can result from a mere 2% increase in contributions from each of two customers) results in an increase in market valuation of supplier firms by $8.21 million. However, these IPO benefits are easily overshadowed by the significant negative consequences of customer concentration on firm profitability. For example, using the standardized estimates, our results suggest that a 10% increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35% in the subsequent year (and that these consequences persist for more than four years, resulting in a cumulative loss of more than 9.4% over the four years). For an average firm in our sample, this translates to an additional loss of about $7 million in the subsequent year, or about $20.32 million over the next four years. Thus, our results suggest that managers must be wary of deleterious consequences of having a concentrated customer base. Further, our results highlight that managers who are exposed to customer concertation may be able to reduce the deleterious consequences of their concentrated customer base by investing in their internal capabilities or going after high-quality customers. For instance, the same supplier firms with a 10% increase in concentration can trim their losses by 2.02% (i.e., losses decrease by 2.02%, from 3.35% to 1.33%) by increasing all their core organizational capabilities by 10%. On the other hand, the same supplier can further increase its losses by .21% (i.e., a total of 3.56%) if it lowers the credit quality of its customers by 10%. Further, to document the trade-off between our moderators, we estimate the percentage increase in capabilities and customer credit quality required to offset the negative effects of a 1% increase in customer concentration. We find that losses due to a 1% increase in customer concentration can be compensated by an increase of 3.23% in operations capability, 5.14% in marketing capability, or 17.87% in technological capability alone. On the other hand, the losses can also be evened out by an increase in 16.05% of customer credit quality. Thus, our results provide actionable guidance to managers in terms of alleviating the deleterious consequences of customer concentration. Finally, our research will help investors pick winners and improve corporate governance by highlighting the downsides of organizational customer management efforts. We acknowledge that not every firm may be able to change its customer mix in the short run; however our objective is to encourage firms to move in the right direction based on their specific situations.9</p><a id="AN0126087333-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0126087333-28" title="Limitations and Future Research">Limitations and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research highlights the negative consequences of customer concentration and cautions managers against relying on a small group of customers for their revenues. However, our study is not without its limitations, which provide several avenues for future research that we outline here. First, as discussed earlier, SFAS 131 requires all firms to disclose revenues from all customers who contribute at least 10% of total revenue. Although this 10% limit covers the significant customers and is consistent with the objectives of our study, having revenue data of all customers could provide additional insights. Second, given that most firms do not disclose the names of their customers, we are not able to include any individual customer characteristics (e.g., reputation or innovativeness of customers) that may influence the effects of customer concentration. Although we include customer credit quality as a measure of the overall quality of a supplier’s customers, scholars with proprietary data sets may find exploring the effects of individual customer characteristics a fertile area for future research. Third, while our measure of customer concentration is derived from secondary data, our study does not include any qualitative information about the nature of customer relationships. We hope researchers will use primary data to learn about customer dependence and relationship quality to provide additional insights into the cause and effects of customer concentration. Finally, future researchers should identify other boundary conditions (e.g., environmental factors, organizational resources) and mediating mechanisms that could highlight other avenues for firms to mitigate the deleterious consequences of customer concentration.</p><a id="AN0126087333-29"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0126087333-29" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  We use the label “strong” to refer to the strength of the relationship between the supplier and its customers.

Specifically, IPO outcomes (market capitalization and initial returns) measure the IPO investors’ evaluations of customer concentration. However, given that pre-IPO investors often have short-term investment horizons (Cadman and Sunder 2014), they emphasize immediate IPO outcomes and overlook factors that may have longer-term negative consequences. This short-term emphasis of pre-IPO investors is consistent with Saboo, Chakravarty, and Grewal (2016), who document that IPO investors obsess over current earnings and overlook myopic marketing activities of IPO firms that may have significant long-term negative consequences. Given that the consequences of our moderators (organizational capabilities and customer credit quality) may not be immediately evident, we do not hypothesize the moderating effects of these variables on the effects of customer concentration on IPO outcomes. In a robustness check, we reestimate our IPO performance model with these interaction effects and do not find any significant moderating effects.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  This missing information of customers accounting for less than 10% does not materially bias our results for several reasons. First, due to our manual data collection efforts, for many firms, we could collect information for customers who accounted for revenues as low as 7%. Second, mathematically, given that we square the revenue shares, small revenue shares are unlikely to materially change our concentration measure. Third, conceptually, customers with a small revenue share are less likely to have the costs/benefits that we outline. The fact that even the Securities and Exchange Commission does not require firms to report information on these customers provides support to our claim. Fourth, we also replicate our analyses using quantile regression, which is less sensitive to measurement error, skewness, and outliers (Peel 2014) and obtain identical results.

This research uses a mixed-methods approach to conceptualize brand coolness and identify a set of characteristics typically associated with cool brands. Focus groups, depth interviews, and an essay study indicate that cool brands are perceived to be extraordinary, aesthetically appealing, energetic, high status, rebellious, original, authentic, subcultural, iconic, and popular. In nine quantitative studies (surveys and experiments), the authors develop scale items to reliably measure the component characteristics of brand coolness; show that brand coolness influences important outcome variables, including consumers' attitudes toward, satisfaction with, intentions to talk about, and willingness to pay for the brand; and demonstrate how cool brands change over time. At first, most brands become cool to a small niche, at which point they are perceived to be more subcultural, rebellious, authentic, and original. Over time, some cool brands become adopted by the masses, at which point they are perceived to be more popular and iconic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: attitudes; authenticity; brands; coolness; niche; scale development; structural equation modeling</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers spend an enormous amount of money on cool brands, and brands from Off-White and Apple to Instagram and Jay-Z have thrived at least in part because consumers consider them cool. Being cool has helped startup brands (e.g., Facebook) soar past established competitors (e.g., Myspace). Being uncool, conversely, can sink even popular and well-funded brands (e.g., Segway, Zune, Levi's), relegating them to the pages of cautionary case studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">What makes a brand cool? Despite the practical and theoretical importance of this question, the answer is unclear. Although research has begun to investigate personality traits associated with cool people ([21]; [22]; [42]; [79]), cool technologies ([17]; [29]; [66]), and how specific factors such as autonomy ([81]; [80]) and novelty ([47]) influence perceptions of coolness, the literature has not systematically identified the characteristics differentiating cool from uncool brands, nor has it identified how these characteristics change as brands move from being cool within a small subculture (i.e., niche cool) to the broader population (i.e., mass cool; [77]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We contribute to the literature by using grounded theory to identify the characteristics associated with cool brands. Through a series of studies leveraging focus groups, depth interviews, essay writing, surveys, and experiments, we generate and validate a measure of brand coolness that incorporates ten characteristics that distinguish cool brands from uncool brands. We find that cool brands are perceived to be extraordinary, aesthetically appealing, energetic, high status, rebellious, original, authentic, subcultural, iconic, and popular. We develop a multi-item scale that measures the ten components, as well as the higher-order construct, of brand coolness. In addition, we explore the nomological network related to brand coolness by identifying a set of variables that are related to, yet conceptually distinct from, coolness, including self–brand connections (SBC), brand love, brand familiarity, brand attitude, word-of-mouth (WOM) about the brand, and willingness to pay (WTP) for the brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moreover, we examine the subjective and dynamic nature of brand coolness ([12]; [31]; [73]). Brands initially become cool to a small subculture by being original, authentic, rebellious, exceptional, and aesthetically pleasing. Such brands (e.g., Steady Hands, INSIDE, Mitsky), which we refer to as being niche cool, are perceived to be cool by a small group of knowledgeable insiders, although the brands remain relatively unfamiliar to the broader population. Over time, some niche cool brands cross over and are adopted by a wider audience, at which point they become mass cool (e.g,. Nike, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, Beyoncé) and are perceived to be relatively more popular and iconic, but less autonomous.</p><a id="AN0138094825-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-2" title="Conceptualizing Cool">Conceptualizing Cool</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Cool has many synonyms (e.g., hip, awesome, sweet, chill, badass, dope; for more, see Urban Dictionary [<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool</a>]) but is difficult to define. Web Appendix A lists over 70 different ways that coolness has been described and defined, illustrates how the literature has not converged on a definition, and highlights the need to establish a firmer, empirically grounded understanding of brand coolness. Given the number of existing definitions of coolness, we believe that the field would benefit less from another definition than from a stronger understanding of how coolness applies to brands. Thus, as a starting point to investigate the characteristics of cool brands, we use Warren and Campbell's (2014, p. 544) definition of coolness as "a <em>subjective</em> and <em>dynamic</em>, socially constructed <em>positive</em> trait attributed to cultural objects inferred to be appropriately <em>autonomous</em>" (emphasis added).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This definition highlights four essential features of coolness ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref15" title="2">2</a>]). One, coolness is subjective. Brands are only cool (or uncool) to the extent that consumers consider them as such ([18]; [37]; [65]). Consequently, uncovering what distinguishes cool from uncool brands requires collecting data about which characteristics consumers associate with the brands that they subjectively perceive to be cool.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two, coolness has a positive valence (e.g., [21]; [53]). Most dictionaries describe cool as an interjection used to express approval, admiration, and acceptance. Studies have found that consumers associate cool products with generally desirable characteristics, including usefulness ([70]; [55]), and hedonic value ([45]). Similarly, when asked to describe traits that they associate with cool people, survey respondents mostly list positive adjectives (e.g., attractive, friendly, competent; [19]). Yet there is also consensus that cool is not merely a general expression of liking. Cool brands are desirable, but there is something extra that makes an object cool rather than merely being positive ([21]; [65]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third defining feature helps distinguish cool from desirable: autonomy. Autonomy is defined as being willing and able to follow your own path rather than conform to the expectations and desires of others ([81]). Autonomy cannot be directly observed, but instead must be inferred on the basis of the extent to which someone (or something) fights conventions and norms (i.e., is rebellious; [17]; [28]; [65]; [68]), attempts to be different by moving beyond conventions and norms (i.e., is original; [17]; [55]; [66]; [75]; [80]), and behaves consistently in the face of pressure to adapt to shifting trends (i.e., is authentic; [57]; [66]; [74]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The fourth defining feature of coolness is that it is dynamic. The brands that are cool today may not be cool tomorrow ([60]; [67]). Even the characteristics—and people—that consumers associate with cool brands appear to change over time and across different types of consumers. Most brands initially become cool within a specific niche or subculture before later being discovered, adopted, and christened as cool by a broader audience ([12]; [33]). Interestingly, consumers tend to use the same term, "cool," to describe both (<a id="bib1up

First, although we know that coolness is desirable (Dar-Nimrod et al. 2012; [53]) and autonomous ([28]; [65]), there are many ways to be desirable and autonomous. For example, signaling high status and offering a low price are both desirable characteristics, and being unique and being dominant both show autonomy. The literature does not specify which desirable and autonomous characteristics make brands cool and which do not. It is also unclear whether other characteristics that are not directly related to desirability and autonomy are prototypical of cool brands. Researchers have suggested that coolness is related to emotional concealment, narcissism, hedonism, excitement, sexual permissiveness, and youth ([16]; [49]; [57]; [65]), but it is unclear whether any of these characteristics distinguish cool from uncool brands. Thus, our first research question is, What characteristics are prototypical of cool brands?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, although there have been several attempts to measure coolness in specific product categories ([17]; [75]; [70]), there are no established scales designed to measure the characteristics of cool brands. Identifying a measure of the different components of brand coolness is practically valuable because it would allow marketers and scholars to identify whether a brand is cool and, if not, examine how and why it lacks coolness. Our second question thus is, Can we develop a validated instrument to measure the component characteristics of cool brands?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, although both practitioners and scholars suggest that being cool helps explain why some products succeed ([12]; [39]; [47]), the specific consequences of brand coolness remain unclear. Are consumers more likely to talk (i.e., spread WOM) about cool brands? Are they willing to pay more for cool brands? Importantly, can brand coolness explain substantial variance in these or other important consequential variables, relative to that explained by previously studied constructs such as brand personality, brand love, and SBC? Our third question thus is, What are the consequences of brand coolness?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, although we know that coolness is dynamic ([33]; [37]), it is not clear how the characteristics or consequences of cool brands change over time. The literature speculates that brands initially become niche cool to a small subculture before becoming mass cool to a broader audience, but how the characteristics and effects of cool brands change over time is an open empirical question. Our fourth question is thus, How do the characteristics and consequences of coolness change as brands move from niche cool to mass cool? Answering all of these questions requires data that the literature does not provide.</p><a id="AN0138094825-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-4" title="Identifying Characteristics: Qualitative Research">Identifying Characteristics: Qualitative Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We use a grounded theory approach to identify the characteristics of cool brands, initially conducting three qualitative studies using focus groups, depth interviews, and essays with consumers from North America and Europe.

First, we used a process of "constant comparison" to organize and reduce the coded units across the different sets of data.

One respondent wrote that he perceived Vic Firth (a musical instrument manufacturing company) to be a cool brand "because of their high-quality product." Another stated that Chrome Industries is a cool brand because "their bags are well known for their durability and functionality." The theme that cool brands are useful converges with evidence in the literature that there is a strong association between perceived coolness and traits that are desired or valued (e.g., [21]; [45]). Some respondents, however, indicated that cool brands are more than just useful—they are extraordinary. Respondents thought that Apple was cool because it offers "previously unheard of capabilities," the brand "pushes the limit in the electronic industry," or simply because "I think they are awesome." The finding that cool brands are extraordinary fits both with literature that highlights the positive valence of coolness (e.g., [12]; [21]) and with dictionary definitions of cool.</p><a id="AN0138094825-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-8" title="Aesthetically appealing">Aesthetically appealing</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another recurring theme across the focus groups, interviews, and essays was that cool brands are aesthetically appealing.

This notion that cool brands are energetic is consistent with the "Brand Energy" construct used by the Brand Asset Valuator system of assessing brand strength ([30]). Although some researchers have suggested that coolness is associated with similar traits, including youth ([60]; [70]), hedonism ([65]), and "sexual permissiveness" ([16]), prior research on coolness has rarely discussed being energetic as a characteristic of cool brands.

Another wrote that the record label Fueled by Ramen "is a cool brand primarily due to its subject matter and authenticity....It has deviated very little from the genre with which it started and increases its reputation with each new successful alternative band that it cultivates."

Even when they become popular, cool brands (e.g., Nike) usually maintain a link to a subculture (e.g., athletes). Research is consistent with the idea that cool brands are tied to specific subcultures, including those linked with jazz, raves, hip-hop, extreme sports, high school cliques, or any other group perceived to be distinct from the mainstream ([19]; [51]; [74]).</p><a id="AN0138094825-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-15" title="Iconic">Iconic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another theme emerging from the focus groups, interviews, and essays was that cool brands are iconic. By iconic, we mean that the brand holds an especially strong and valued meaning to consumers ([42]). There was a high overlap between the brands that our respondents identified as cool and the brands that [40]; [43]) describes as cultural icons (e.g., Apple, Nike, Patagonia, Jack Daniels). Moreover, our respondents highlighted how cool brands can symbolize memories, social relationships, identity traits, and cultural values. For example, one wrote, "Disney is a symbol of childhood and being young and allows people to act young at heart which I think also helps add to the idea that Disney is cool." All strong brands acquire some symbolic meaning ([46]; [48]), but respondents view cool brands as having especially potent meanings that reflect their shared cultural values and beliefs. For example, European respondents who value social responsibility considered socially conscious and environmentally friendly brands (e.g., the Finnish brand Globe Hope) to be cool. The literature notes the strong symbolism of cool brands ([12]; [81]), though we are not aware of previous work that has attempted to operationalize or measure the extent to which cool brands are iconic.</p><a id="AN0138094825-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-16" title="Popular">Popular</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A final theme in the focus groups, interviews, and essays is that cool brands are popular, meaning that they seem trendy or widely admired by consumers. For example, one European respondent stated that for a brand to be cool, "It has to be recognized all over the world." Similarly, an American respondent wrote, "I consider Nike cool because it is a brand widely worn among a variety of people." We note here that some of the prior literature suggests that, paradoxically, cool brands are scarce (instead of popular), meaning that they are rare, exclusive, or not accessible to everyone ([16]; [55]; [67]). However, research that has used quantitative methods to study coolness has not found a link between scarcity and coolness in either people ([44]; [42]) or products ([17]; [70]; [73]). We too did not find adequate empirical support for a general link between scarcity and brand coolness in either our qualitative research or our quantitative surveys (see Web Appendices B and C).[<a id="bib8up

In other words, cool brands typically begin as scarce and subcultural but later become more popular as they are discovered and transition from niche cool to mass cool (see Figure 1).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1.

Specifically, a research assistant indicated whether the 75 essays mentioned each of the ten characteristics that appeared in the qualitative responses for both the description of the cool brand and the description of the uncool brand. If the essay noted a high level of the characteristic (e.g., "brand X is original"), the research assistant coded it as a 1; if not, he coded it as a 0 (complete results in Web Appendix B). The characteristic that essay respondents most strongly associated with cool brands was being iconic. Most (73%) noted that cool brands seem iconic or that they symbolize an important value, belief, or memory (only 8% of uncool brands were described as being iconic; χ<sup>2</sup> = 66.34, <em>p</em> &lt;.001). Most respondents similarly reported that cool brands were extraordinary or useful (76%), though this did not distinguish cool from uncool brands, as respondents also considered most uncool brands useful (71%; χ<sup>2</sup> =.55, <em>p</em> =.46). Responses suggested several additional characteristics that distinguish cool from uncool brands. Specifically, they were more likely to describe cool brands as being more subcultural (44% vs. 7%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.63, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), original (33% vs. 4%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.25, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), aesthetically appealing (25% vs. 4%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 18.85, <em>p</em> &lt;.001), popular (17% vs. 4%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.00, <em>p</em> =.008), high status (15% vs. 4%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.04, <em>p</em> =.02), and energetic (8% vs. 0%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.25, <em>p</em> =.01) than uncool brands.

Other themes that the literature discusses but that did not surface in the data were emotional concealment, friendliness, and competence ([44]; [42]; [65]; [79]). One way to reconcile the absence of cultural knowledge, friendliness, and competence in our findings is by recognizing that these traits are desirable in people ([26]), just as being extraordinary, energetic, and aesthetically appealing are desirable in brands. Thus, desirable traits are cool in both people and brands, but the specific traits that are desired differ for people and brands.

The first four studies were pretests, in which we developed and refined the measures for the structural and nomological models. Due to length constraints, we describe these studies in Web Appendix C. Study 5 had three purposes. First, it confirmed the structural measurement model for the ten characteristics associated with brand coolness (useful, aesthetically appealing, energetic, high status, rebellious, original, authentic, subcultural, iconic, and popular). Second, the study confirmed that all ten characteristics were more closely associated with cool brands than uncool brands. Third, the study tested the nomological relationship between brand coolness and related constructs, including brand personality, SBC, brand love, brand attitude, WTP for the brand, and intentions to spread WOM about the brand. The last three studies replicated and extended Study 5. Study 6 improved our measure of brand coolness by developing items that better capture the extent to which the brand seems <em>extraordinary</em> rather than merely <em>useful</em>. Study 7 used a purely confirmatory design to replicate the results of Study 6. Finally, Study 8 examined the dynamic and subjective nature of brand coolness by testing how the characteristics and consequences differ between niche cool brands, mass cool brands, and uncool brands within a subculture of urban streetwear enthusiasts.</p><a id="AN0138094825-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-20" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0138094825-21"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-21" title="Samples">Samples</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies 5 (N = 315; 50% male; modal age = 42 years) and 6 (N = 315; 47% male; modal age = 25–30) recruited U.S. consumers from a nationally representative online survey panel.

We used Studies 5–8 to confirm our final model (see Figure 2). We used a reflective instead of a formative model at each level for two reasons. One, the logic underlying reflective models better fits our conceptualization of brand coolness: the ten characteristics derived from the qualitative analyses are more appropriately considered to be manifestations of the latent construct of brand coolness, rather than formative measures that define it. Two, the coefficients in formative models can vary with the number and structure of the measures and factors used ([<a id="bib4up

The three characteristics of "useful" (later, "extraordinary"), "energetic," and "aesthetic appeal" load onto the subdimension of desirability; the two first-order factors of "original" and "authentic" load onto the subdimension of positive autonomy. Both desirability and positive autonomy are dimensions of higher-order brand coolness, along with high status, rebellious, subcultural, iconic, and popular, which load as first-order factors onto higher-order brand coolness.

factors and model structure were stable across all of the studies and samples, with a few small differences. The factor loadings were high, and the average variance extracted and composite construct reliability statistics for all factors were almost always above.50[11] and.70, respectively. We formally tested for the equivalence of measurement and structural coefficients across the cool and uncool samples in Studies 5, 6, and 7, and almost all were equivalent (see Web Appendix E). In the few cases where the coefficients differed (e.g., iconic and popularity in Study 8), the differences, which were small, were likely because we needed to estimate the CFA model across the niche cool, mass cool, and uncool brand subsamples to get a sufficient sample size.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The goodness-of-fit indices also showed an excellent fit across all of the studies and subsamples. For example, the statistics for the cool brand subsample in Study 5 were χ<sup>2</sup>(582) = 1,283.33, <em>p</em> &lt;.001; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) =.06; nonnormed fit index (NNFI) =.97; comparative fit index (CFI) =.97; standardized root mean residual (SRMR) =.08.

As illustrated in Table 3, the goodness-of-fit measures were similar in Studies 6–8. Thus, our measurement model of brand coolness satisfies conventional tests of adequacy. Across Studies 5–7, the measurement factor loadings for the characteristics of cool brands averaged.81 and ranged from.62–.96. For uncool brands, their average was.86, and they ranged from.53–.97. The factor loadings from the first-order to second-order factors (e.g., originality to positive autonomy) ranged, across all the samples and studies, from.75–.99, averaging.90. The betas from the second-order factors to higher-order brand coolness (e.g., desirability to higher-order brand coolness) ranged from.38–1.0, averaging.86.

and aesthetically appealing; Nike (6.6 overall), which seemed especially popular; Samsung (6.4), which seemed especially original; Under Armour (6.6), which seemed especially popular and aesthetically appealing; and Adidas (6.6), which seemed especially popular (see Table 4). Interestingly, different participants referenced many of these same brands (Apple, Nike, Samsung, Adidas) as being uncool, because they perceived the brands to be lower status, less subcultural, and less rebellious. Other brands that participants frequently nominated as being uncool include Microsoft, Reebok, Old Navy, Walmart, and Crocs. The fact that consumers in Studies 5–7 differed about which brands were cool and uncool confirms the subjective nature of coolness, especially when looking across a diverse sample of consumers. As we might expect, participants in Study 8, who were all part of an urban streetwear subculture, agreed more about which brands were and were not cool compared with participants in Studies 5–7.</p><a id="AN0138094825-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-29" title="Are Cool Brands Extraordinary or Merely Useful?">Are Cool Brands Extraordinary or Merely Useful?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As previously mentioned, Study 6 tested whether our model and scale would be conceptually and empirically stronger if the first characteristic measured how extraordinary (four items: exceptional, superb, fantastic, and extraordinary) the brand was, as opposed to measuring the extent to which the brand seemed (merely) useful (three items: useful, helpful, and valuable). Study 6 therefore measured all seven of these items and compared the coefficients and fit statistics of models that used either the new extraordinary items or the old useful items. The models were not nested, which makes chi-square difference tests inappropriate; however, the model fit statistics (NNFI, CFI, RMSEA, and SRMR) for the new four-item models were superior or equal to those for the old three-item models. The completely standardized lambda coefficients for the extraordinary items were all very high (.89–.97) in both the cool and uncool subsamples. Most importantly, the structural coefficients from the first-order useful/extraordinary factor to the second-order desirability factor were higher with the new four items than with the old three items, increasing from.77 to.83 (for cool brands) and from.85 to.93 (for uncool brands). The structural coefficients from the desirability second-order factor to the overall brand coolness factor were also slightly higher in both cases, increasing from.99 to 1.0. Drawing on this empirical evidence, and given the strong conceptual argument favoring this change (e.g., [12]; [65]), we replaced the three useful items with these four extraordinary items in Studies 6–8 and in the final recommended items for our brand coolness scale.</p><a id="AN0138094825-30"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-30" title="Discriminant Validity of Brand Coolness from Conceptually Related Constructs">Discriminant Validity of Brand Coolness from Conceptually Related Constructs</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0138094825-31"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-31" title="Theoretical distinctions">Theoretical distinctions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brand coolness should be related to, but conceptually distinct from, the constructs of brand love, SBC, particular dimensions of brand personality, and brand attitudes.

Although there is likely some overlap between specific characteristics of coolness (in particular, high status, energetic, and useful/extraordinary) and specific dimensions of brand personality (sophistication, excitement, and competence, respectively), our latent construct of higher-order brand coolness, which includes many other constituent characteristics (see Figure 2), should display discriminant validity from these brand personality dimensions.

Brand personality serves a symbolic or self-expressive function for consumers, and it consists of five core dimensions: sophistication, competence, ruggedness, excitement, and sincerity ([<a id="bib1up

On the one hand, it could be argued that these brand personality perceptions should make that brand seem more, or less, cool, and they thus serve as antecedents of overall perceived brand coolness. On the other hand, it could also be argued that the multiple marketing and sociocultural elements (e.g., communications content, choice of endorsers) that shape these brand personality perceptions should also simultaneously shape the perceived coolness of the brand. Therefore, it is difficult (especially in cross-sectional survey data) to empirically determine which perceptual changes came first. Because some of a brand's personality dimensions (especially excitement and sophistication) are conceptually similar to some of our brand coolness components (energetic and status, respectively), and because it is unreasonable in our data to expect a strong empirical signal about which dimensions come first, we were cautious in our analyses and modeled the five brand personality dimensions as correlates, rather than antecedents, of higher-order brand coolness. This has the benefit of yielding model estimates of the effects of brand coolness on mediating (e.g., brand love, SBC) and dependent variables (brand attitude, WOM, and WTP) that are "net of" (i.e., they control for and partial out) the effects of these independently measured brand personality dimensions and are thus more conservative.[12]</p><a id="AN0138094825-35"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-35" title="Theoretical consequences">Theoretical consequences</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To examine the consequences of brand coolness, our nomological model also estimated the effects of overall brand coolness on several different dependent variables: SBC (Studies 5–8), brand love (Studies 5–8), WTP (Studies 5–8), willingness to spread WOM (Studies 5–8), brand attitudes (Studies 5, 7, and 8), brand familiarity (Studies 7 and 8), brand exposure (Studies 7 and 8), whether the brand commands a price premium (Studies 7 and 8), satisfaction (Study 5), delight (Study 5), and pride (Study 5) in owning the brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers view coolness as a desirable trait ([21]; [53]; [67]). Moreover, we find that brand coolness includes multiple characteristics (e.g., being extraordinary and aesthetically pleasing) that consumers consider desirable. Consequently, we hypothesize that brand coolness should predict consumers' overall attitude toward the brand, and we include brand attitude valence as a consequence of brand coolness. Beyond increasing overall desirability and liking, brand coolness should also increase several other types of distinct positive feelings toward the brand. Because cool brands are considered desirable, coolness should create a feeling of high overall satisfaction with the brand ([61]). The satisfaction literature also talks of feelings of delight, in which high-arousal feelings of joy and surprise augment the more cognitively based satisfaction assessment ([<a id="bib8up

We therefore hypothesize that brand coolness will strengthen SBC ([24]) because SBC increases as a brand's symbolic aspects become more consistent with a consumer's aspirational reference groups. Consumers' relationships with a cool brand might also extend beyond SBC to increase brand love, a broad brand relationship construct that includes current and desired self-identity ([<a id="bib9up

Because of the desirable and identity-relevant characteristics associated with cool brands, it is similarly likely that consumers will also feel greater pride from owning brands that they perceive to be cool (Tracy and Robbins 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Both SBC and brand love tend to increase consumers' WTP for and likelihood of discussing (WOM) a brand ([<a id="bib9up

Thus, if brand coolness increases SBC and brand love, as we hypothesize, then consumers should be willing to pay more for the brand (i.e., WTP) and want to tell others how great it is (i.e., WOM). Finally, because cool brands are high status, popular, and iconic, we also expect that they will command a higher price premium, be familiar to more consumers, and gain more exposure compared with brands that are not cool.</p><a id="AN0138094825-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-36" title="Results of nomological models">Results of nomological models</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We tested these predictions by modeling overall (higher-order) brand coolness as being correlated with the five dimensions of brand personality (in Studies 5 and 7) and as leading to a set of consequences (which varied slightly depending on which consequence variables we measured in the studies; see Web Appendix G), including brand attitudes, SBC, brand love, WTP, WOM, brand familiarity, brand exposure, price premium, satisfaction, delight, and pride.

Across all our studies, brand coolness explained between 32%–70% of the variance in brand attitudes, an amount that was similar to the variation explained by brand love (26%–85%) and SBC (19%–67%). Brand coolness similarly explained a comparable amount of variance in WOM (32%–57%) and WTP (32%–79%) as brand love (WOM: 25%–74%; WTP: 29%–86%) and SBC (WOM: 26%–79%; WTP: 29%–84%). As detailed in Web Appendix G, the amount of variance that brand coolness explained varied by outcome, study, and brand sample. For example, in Study 7, in the cool (uncool) brands data, the variance explained in brand attitude by brand coolness alone was 54% (32%), compared with 48% (85%) by brand love alone and 22% (64%) by SBC alone. The variance explained in WOM by brand coolness alone by was 32% (57%), compared with 35% (25%) by brand love alone and 32% (26%) by SBC alone. For WTP, the variance explained by brand coolness alone was 38% (67%), compared with 45% (47%) by brand love alone and 33% (47%) by SBC alone. These results show that brand coolness has a lot of explanatory power and is thus worth studying as a construct in its own right. Table 4 also shows how the mean levels of brands on these outcome variables become higher when the brand is seen as cool (vs. less cool).</p><a id="AN0138094825-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-38" title="Mediation tests">Mediation tests</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The nomological models estimated only the direct effects of higher-order brand coolness on the many outcome variables; they did not test for mediation. Although cross-sectional data do not allow us to unambiguously establish causal sequences, it is nonetheless interesting to test whether the data were consistent with the hypothesis that brand love and SBC mediate the effects of brand coolness on brand attitude, WTP, and WOM. We therefore estimated SEMs to test these hypothesized mediating paths in Studies 5, 6, and 7. We provide the details for these analyses in Web Appendix H. To summarize results, the effect of higher-order brand coolness on each of the dependent variables—brand attitude, WOM, and WTP—was partially or fully mediated by SBC and brand love in each study and subsample. As a specific example, in Study 7, the cool brands data, brand coolness significantly influenced brand love (standardized coefficient.77) and SBC (.67); brand love significantly influenced brand attitudes (1.86), WTP (1.34), and WOM (.55); and SBC significantly influenced brand attitude (−1.01) but did not significantly influence WOM or WTP. Brand coolness also directly and significantly influenced brand attitude (.61) and WTP (.65) but not WOM. In summary, brand love fully mediated the effects of brand coolness on WOM, but partially mediated the effects of brand coolness on brand attitude and WTP. This pattern of mediation supports the conceptual argument that brand coolness, which a consumer perceives <em>in</em> a brand, is an antecedent to constructs such as brand love and SBC, which are a consumer's evaluative <em>responses to</em> a brand that result from the properties perceived in the brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Study 7 results illustrate both the large amounts of variance explained in the outcome constructs by higher-order brand coolness and the mediation pathways for these effects. In the cool (uncool) brand sample, brand coolness explained 35% (57%) of the variance in SBC, 42% (52%) in brand love, 52% (77%) in brand attitudes, 43% (56%) in WTP, and 31% (25%) in WOM. For the cool (uncool) brands, the standardized direct path coefficients from brand coolness to the outcome constructs (all <em>p</em>s &lt;.01) were as follows: SBC =.59 (.76), brand love =.65 (.72), brand attitude =.53 (.27), WTP =.51 (.52), and WOM =.18 (.20). For cool brands, the standardized indirect path coefficients from SBC to brand attitude (−.28) and WOM (.24) were both significant, as was the path from brand love to brand attitudes (.46). For the uncool brands, the standardized indirect path coefficients from SBC to WTP (.34) and WOM (.33) were significant, as was the path from brand love to brand attitude (.55). Thus, the effects of higher-order brand coolness on each of the dependent variables—brand attitude, WOM, and WTP—were partially or fully mediated by SBC and brand love in each study.</p><a id="AN0138094825-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-39" title="Methods Factor Tests">Methods Factor Tests</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We tested the degree to which common method bias affected our structural and measurement models in Studies 7 and 8 using the well-accepted "marker variables" technique presented in [81].

We expected that the data from the streetwear subculture would replicate the previous studies by showing that both mass cool and niche cool brands would score higher on all ten characteristics of cool brands compared with uncool brands.

To keep the number of factors in the experiment manageable, we did not manipulate the extent to which the brand seemed iconic or subcultural,[13] and we contrasted cool with uncool brands rather than distinguishing between mass and niche cool brands. Consumers form their actual perceptions of brand coolness over multiple exposures to various brand marketing and social signals over a long period of time; thus, our single-exposure experiment provides a conservative test of whether the characteristics influence perceptions of brand coolness.

Our research (three qualitative and nine quantitative studies) reveals that cool brands are extraordinary, aesthetically appealing, energetic, original, authentic, rebellious, high status, subcultural, iconic, and popular. Not all of these characteristics are necessary for every brand and every consumer segment, but, as our experiment revealed, increasing any of these characteristics tends to make a brand seem cooler. Nike is widely seen as cool because its shoes are highly desirable, look good, signal energy, and have extraordinary quality. Apple shows positive autonomy by being original and authentic, even as it has grown to become very popular. Harley-Davidson became cool when a subculture of outlaw bikers, who lent the brand a rebellious, iconic image, adopted the brand ([40]). BMW, conversely, is cool in part because it has become a popular status symbol. These ten characteristics correlate with the perception that a brand is cool, distinguish cool brands from uncool brands, and comprise distinct but related components of a higher-order structural model of brand coolness.</p><a id="AN0138094825-51"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-51" title="The Life Cycle of Coolness">The Life Cycle of Coolness</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research additionally contributes to theory on the dynamic nature of coolness (e.g., [33]) and brands (e.g., [63]) by exploring how the characteristics of cool brands change as a brand becomes niche cool, transitions from niche to mass cool, and eventually begins to lose its cool (see Figure 1). Brands initially become cool within a particular subculture (e.g., Quicksilver with surfers, Rocawear with hip-hop enthusiasts, Supreme with skaters) of people who perceive the brand to rebellious, autonomous, desirable, and high status and adopt it as a way to distinguish themselves from the masses. Some niche cool brands break free from subcultural obscurity to become cool to the masses. As brands such as Quicksilver, Rocawear, and Supreme expand from a fringe group of outsiders to mass-marketed magazines and suburban shopping malls, they start to seem less rebellious, original, authentic, and extraordinary—and less cool—to their original subcultural consumers (surfers, rappers, and skaters, respectively). But, despite losing some of their autonomy, mass cool brands also become more familiar, command a higher price premium, and control a larger market share. Purists may deride them for selling out, but brands perceived to be mass cool (e.g., Nike, Grand Theft Auto, Beyoncé) are more popular and profitable than their more obscure niche cool counterparts (e.g., Steady Hands, INSIDE, Mitsky). Mass cool brands, however, need to be careful not to lose the characteristics (e.g., desirability, autonomy) that made them cool in the first place, or they will become passé. We saw this in our data: while many consumers continue to think that Apple and Nike are cool, others are beginning to consider these brands uncool because they no longer see them as being rebellious, autonomous, high status, or as having the other characteristics that made them cool in the first place. Because we did not collect longitudinal data, our findings about the coolness life cycle remain preliminary. We strongly encourage future research to more closely investigate how brands change as they move from niche cool to mass cool to passé.</p><a id="AN0138094825-52"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-52" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For many product categories and consumer segments, a brand's perceived coolness is an important factor in driving its success, and managers have long sought to figure out how to give their brands this mysterious quality ([<a id="bib2up

Our scale components can also be used for pretesting and evaluating different marketing and communication programs that are designed to increase or maintain a brand's perceived coolness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">How should managers respond if their brand is not scoring high enough on one or more component characteristics of brand coolness? They will need to reinforce the image of the band on the characteristic or characteristics it is lacking. How, specifically, firms should do this will depend on the brand's history, industry, and target customers, but we can offer a few tentative guidelines. Brands that want to be seen as more extraordinary will likely need to create breakthrough functional specs (e.g., being the first facial-unlocking smartphone) or deliver an unsurpassed customer service (e.g., Amazon) rather than offer incremental improvements (e.g., a slightly better smartphone camera) or "run-of-the-mall" service. To improve their aesthetic appeal, brands will need to create eye-popping designs; Apple and Nike, highly rated in our data and by pollsters, are known for this. Brands can become more energetic and original by continuously innovating and being one step ahead of the competition, like Google or Samsung Electronics. To be seen as authentic, brands will need to remind consumers of the history and core values of the brand and its founders (e.g., Patagonia does this effectively) while avoiding the appearance of using overt advertisements or other strategies associated with mass-marketed brands. Brands can appear more subcultural by using a promotion strategy that links the brand with an admired subculture (e.g., via brand community events, such as Harley-Davidson's annual rallies in Sturgis, South Dakota), as long as the tactics seem authentic. Brands could become more rebellious by hiring spokespeople known to challenge norms, as Nike recently did through its campaign featuring NFL outcast Colin Kaepernick. Brands can boost their perceived status through packaging, ad style, spokespeople, high prices, retail cobranding, and media placements that make the brand seem glamorous, sophisticated, and exclusive. Becoming iconic is not easy, but brands might be able to seem more iconic through distinctive packaging (e.g., the Coca-Cola contour bottle), a memorable advertising style (e.g., the early artistic and witty campaigns of Absolut vodka), or telling a brand myth that resonates with consumers (e.g., the nostalgic frontier story of Jack Daniels; [41]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firms will also need to assess whether their brand is currently niche cool, mass cool, or uncool to understand how to best manage the brand's characteristics. An existing uncool brand might first need to become niche cool, by engaging in behaviors (products, promotions, pricing, and distribution strategies) that make the brand seem rebellious, original, and authentic. To become niche cool, brands will also need to cultivate a close relationship with a particular subculture rather than target the mass market (as Pabst did with hipsters in the early 2000s or as Instagram initially did with photography enthusiasts). After successfully becoming niche cool, brands could try to boost their popularity to transition to mass cool, but they will need to maintain their connection to a subculture (e.g., Nike to its top athletes) and its perceived autonomy (e.g., as Apple did by positioning itself as an edgier alternative to Microsoft) so they do not entirely lose their cool.</p><a id="AN0138094825-53"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-53" title="Limitations and Future Research Opportunities">Limitations and Future Research Opportunities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Many important questions remain for future research. Among them is the question of how brand coolness relates to nomologically related constructs, especially brand personality. Our studies showed that the effects of brand coolness on brand attitudes, WOM, and WTP are partially or completely mediated by brand love and SBC. However, our mediation analysis measured (but did not manipulate) variables and could not test every possible mediation sequence. Thus, future research could use experimental techniques or cross-lagged analysis of time-series data to better test among possible causal sequences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, while our data established discriminant validity between brand coolness and related constructs, we did not have access to multitrait-multimethod data, which are necessary for more definitive conclusions in this regard, as well as for a stronger estimate of common methods bias ([64]). Our scale development and validation would also benefit from follow-up analyses with other types of data (e.g., using within-brand variance across individuals), as [34] point out in the context of brand personality scales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, although we collected data from multiple cultures, we did not formally investigate cross-cultural differences. Given the cultural differences observed in brand personality ([36]), more work is needed to investigate if and how the characteristics or consequences of brand coolness vary across cultures. Brands that are rebellious, subcultural, and autonomous may be more cool in relatively independent cultures (e.g., United States, Germany) than in interdependent ones (e.g., Korea, Japan; [62]), whereas brands that have high status may be more cool in cultures higher on power distance (e.g., India, China). Within cultures, individual differences in need for uniqueness ([77]), counterculturalism ([78]), susceptibility to interpersonal influence ([10]), symbolic capital ([39]), and others may influence which characteristics consumers consider cool and which consumer segments thirst more for cool brands. Given that coolness is subjective, it will be especially important for future research to investigate which social, cultural, individual difference, and category characteristics moderate what consumers perceive to be cool and how they respond to cool brands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future research should also further examine the relationship between the specific coolness components, overall brand coolness, and downstream consequences such as brand attitudes, WOM, and WTP. The structural model coefficients estimated in Studies 5–8 (Table 3) and our experiment suggest that the ten characteristics independently contribute to overall brand coolness, but our studies do not offer strong tests of whether these characteristics might interact. In particular, future research should further investigate the relationship between rebellion and coolness. In our data, the "main effects" of rebellion on higher-order brand coolness were almost always the lowest across our ten first-order factors, suggesting that higher perceived rebelliousness does not by itself always raise overall brand coolness as much as other components (such as originality and authenticity) do. In summary, much remains to be understood about the important brand management construct of brand coolness, and we encourage researchers to further investigate why, how, and when coolness contributes to a brand's success.</p><a id="AN0138094825-54"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094825-54" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919857698 - Brand Coolness</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919857698 for Brand Coolness by Caleb Warren, Rajeev Batra, Sandra Maria Correia Loureiro and Richard P.

The authors examine brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign countries. Incorporating the unique characteristics of these products, the authors develop a theoretical framework that integrates similarity, which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name translations. The authors analyze Hollywood movies shown in China from 2011 to 2018. The results show that higher similarity leads to higher Chinese box office revenue, and this effect is stronger for movies that perform better in the home market (i.e., the United States). When the translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for Hollywood movies with greater cultural gap in the Chinese market. Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest when the movie is released and reduce over time. This research provides valuable guidance to companies, managers, and policy makers in cultural product industries as well as those in international marketing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: branding; cultural product; emerging market; international marketing; movie</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Cultural products are goods and services that include performing and visual arts, heritage conservation (e.g., museums, galleries), and the media (e.g., publishing, broadcasting, movies, recording) ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref1" title="1">1</a>]).[<a id="bib7up

In its most recent survey, the [10] shows that arts and cultural economic activities accounted for over US$800 billion in the United States in 2016. A recent report estimates that cultural products generate over US$2,250 billion of revenue and 30 million jobs each year worldwide ([77]). Recent developments in digital technologies are further enhancing the value and influence of cultural products: their distribution has become increasingly global, and consumers of these products are connected across the world on an unprecedented scale ([59]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Associated with these market and technological trends, cultural products are responsible for a growing share of U.S. trade, and international markets have become a major target for the producers ([30]). In the film industry, for instance, more than 70% of Hollywood's box office revenue now comes from overseas ([54]). The influence of international markets has become so important to Hollywood that "potential overseas ticket sales nowadays determine whether or not a studio executive gives the go-ahead to a movie" ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref8" title="8">8</a>]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similar to other products, when a cultural product is introduced into a foreign market, a key decision is the brand name: the company must decide how to translate the original brand name into the foreign language ([42]). Yet unlike noncultural products (e.g., consumer packaged goods, apparel, electronics, appliances, automobiles) that have been the focus of prior international marketing research, cultural products are associated with several unique challenges for brand name translation. First, cultural products such as movies and books are prime examples of experiential products ([35]). For these products, consumption experience is difficult to evaluate prior to purchase. It depends critically on the creative content, such as the plot and characters of a movie and the storyline of a novel ([24]; [75]). Therefore, consumers often utilize extrinsic cues to help them make the purchase decision ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref13" title="7">7</a>]). Prior research has suggested that the brand name is an important extrinsic cue for product quality ([83]). Therefore, brand name plays an important role in the consumer purchase of cultural products. For instance, the title of a movie or book can be used to suggest the storyline or the main character. When consumers have different cultural backgrounds, whether and to what extent to provide such information are important decisions in the brand name translation for cultural products in international markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, by definition, culture-specific factors play a key role in consumer evaluation of cultural products. This is not the case for many noncultural products. For instance, across different countries, the quality of an automobile is evaluated by a similar set of factors (e.g., reliability, mechanical performance, maintenance cost). However, a movie that is rooted deeply in the culture or heritage of one country may not be easily understood in another ([20]; [30]). Thus, brand name translation of cultural products must take into account how culture-oriented nuances can be better understood in a foreign market where cultural distance exists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the sales period of noncultural products is typically long—companies that sell detergent, electronics, or cars can take an extended time to build brand awareness and consumer preference. In contrast, many cultural products have relatively short life cycles. This is particularly true for entertainment products such as movies, TV shows, and video games. For example, most movies are in theaters for only six to ten weeks ([12]; [43]). Thus, while it is possible for firms to use the original brand name of noncultural products in a foreign country where the language is different (e.g., to use Chrysler and IBM brand names in Japan) and gradually deploy marketing tools to increase sales, it is difficult to do so for cultural products. It is thus critical for the brand names of these products to be translated properly to foster consumer gain awareness and promote content. Furthermore, given the short time window available to attract customer attention, the impact of translated brand names on product sales can be more significant for cultural products than for noncultural products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, media coverage and peer-to-peer communication in the form of physical or online word-of-mouth communication, search, and participation in experiential activities are often very active for cultural products ([37]; [53]).[<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref21" title="8">8</a>] This fluid and far-reaching information, coupled with a short life cycle, can induce intense and fluctuating demand for cultural products—sales tend to be fast changing over weeks or even days. It is therefore both interesting and important to study the dynamics of how brand name translation affects product sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we take these challenges into consideration and examine how different brand name translation strategies affect the sales of cultural products in international markets. In our theorizing of the effects and developing hypotheses, the context of international markets calls for insights from international marketing literature, and the focus on cultural products requires us to conceptualize the extent to which a translated brand name reveals product content. We test the hypotheses with Hollywood movies shown in the Chinese market from January 2011 to June 2018. This empirical context is valuable for several reasons. Movies are the prototypical example of cultural products. As a key element that builds identity and awareness, the title can be viewed as the brand name of a movie. Although a rich literature has generated useful insights into the drivers of movie sales, no research has examined the effects of movie titles in international markets. Moreover, the relationship between Hollywood studios and the Chinese market is among the most critical in the international movie market. In 2012 China overtook Japan to become the largest theatrical market outside the United States, and in 2016 the number of screens in China surpassed those in the United States ([73]). Consequently, Hollywood studios have a keen interest in marketing their products in China. A study of brand name strategies for Hollywood movies in China thus has strong substantive value. Finally, English is a phonographic language, which represents the sound components of the spoken language using letters or syllabic symbols. Chinese, however, belongs to the logographic system, which represents the meanings of words in the form of symbols ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref23" title="3">3</a>], p. 467). From a linguistic point of view, the most challenging practice of brand name translation occurs between a phonographic system and a logographic system ([67]). However, such translations are frequently encountered by multinational corporations ([25]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research provides four main contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on brand name translation strategies for the sales of cultural products in international markets. Given the growing importance of these products in the marketplace, as well as their unique characteristics, a study that considers the roles of brand names, cultural gap, and temporal dynamics is warranted.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we contribute to the international marketing and branding literature streams by developing a new theoretical framework for the impact of brand name translation. The majority of research in this literature has focused on the impacts of standardization versus adaptation. The existing analysis, however, does not capture some key nuances embedded in the aforementioned cultural products. We thus complement similarity, a key element in the strategy of standardization, with the informativeness of translated brand names to construct an integrated framework. Because marketing standardization can be achieved through strategies such as advertising, pricing, supply chain, and distribution channels, our study contributes to the international marketing literature by focusing on brand name translation, a particular route that has so far received only limited attention.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we consider temporal dynamics and, in the U.S.–China movie context, we estimate how the translation of movie titles influences sales throughout the theatrical release. This makes ours one of the few studies on brand name strategies to examine the longitudinal effects of brand name translations in international markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, our study makes an important contribution to the movie research literature, given that very limited research has examined the impact of movie titles. The empirical study of movie sales in China also provides a contribution to research on emerging markets (e.g., [56])—in particular, we answer the call for expanding research to emerging markets to "ask and answer new questions related to consumers, cultures, institutions and regulation" ([55], p. 473).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The next section discusses the related literatures on branding and movie research. We then present our theoretical framework, followed by the empirical study including data, model specifications, identification method, and findings. We conclude with managerial implications and directions for future research.</p><a id="AN0142666422-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-2" title="Literature Review">Literature Review</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The backdrop of our research is international marketing, with a focus on branding strategies for movies as cultural products.

A major driver of the transfer is the extent to which the translated brand name and the original brand name resemble each other. Such resemblance (referred to as "brand name similarity" in our conceptualization) is one element of marketing standardization, which refers to the general practice of applying common marketing strategies across different countries ([65]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beginning with pioneering works such as [50] and [80], standardization versus adaptation has been one of the most important strategic considerations in international marketing ([86]). A core argument in this literature is that, when a company enters international markets, standardized marketing strategies help lower market entry cost on the supply side and capitalize brand assets from the home market on the demand side ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref35" title="4">4</a>]). This is particularly important when competition is fierce and consumers live an increasingly connected world. [65] provide a survey of research that examines performance implications of marketing program standardization. They find that "the majority of studies have indicated that the pursuit of standardized marketing activities by itself has mostly a positive impact on performance" (p. 26). For instance, [58] compare U.S. and European companies operating in both a developed economy (Japan) and an emerging market (Turkey). They find that marketing standardization leads to higher performance. [71] find that perceived brand globalness as a result of consistent brand positioning across countries generates higher purchase intention.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, when international market environments are very different from each other, marketing strategy standardization becomes less effective. This contingency view is proposed and tested by [38] on international subsidiaries of U.S., Japanese, and German companies. The authors show that strategy standardization leads to superior performance only when there is fit between a company's market environments (e.g., regulations, technology, customers, traditions) and its international marketing strategy choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We want to highlight three areas in which our study relates to (but also deviates from) the previous studies in this literature. First, the research on standardization initially focused on advertising before examining a broader array of marketing activities ([58]; [63]). Subsequently, scholars have studied standardization in the product mix, advertising and promotion, channels of distribution, sales, pricing, and marketing program or brand positioning as a whole (e.g., [17]; [38]; [44]; [45]; [79]). However, the impact of the brand name, a critical component of marketing strategies, has received scant attention. [25] is one of the few extant studies on marketing standardization that focuses on brand names.

[84] classify the translation between a phonographic language and a logographic language into three types: phonetic translation (by sound only), semantic translation (by meaning only), and phonosemantic translation (by sound plus meaning). Because phonetic translation uses local alphabets or words to mimic the pronunciation of the original brand, the translated brand name does not carry any real meaning. In a bilingual setting, [85] demonstrate that consumers' proficiency in the language associated with the original brand name moderates the effects of different translation methods. Extending the phonetic–semantic framework, [81] classify translated brand names into four types—alphanumeric, phonetic, phonosemantic, and semantic, ranging from the least meaningful to the most meaningful—and estimated their effects on automobile sales. They found that Chinese consumers' preference for vehicle models is strongest when the translated brand name is semantic and weakest when it is phonosemantic. The brand name translation studies provide a valuable foundation for our research, because similarity between the original and translated brand names, a major component in our theoretical framework, is driven by how similar the brand names are to each other in both meaning and sound.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1 provides a summary of the previous studies on brand name translation. Our research differs from these studies in three important ways. First, all prior research examines either consumer packaged goods or durable products; none speaks to cultural products, the focus of our research. Second, no prior research has examined temporal effects associated with brand name translation. We study several moderation effects, including temporal dynamics, to enhance the insights and managerial implications. Third, with the exception of [81], all the other studies use either lab experiments or surveys. We analyze field data in movies to examine brand name translation strategies for cultural products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1.

This is not surprising, because the product categories studied previously (consumer packaged goods and automobiles) can be translated semantically, phonetically, or a combination of both ([25]). However, cultural products are different: the emphasis on content requires the translation of brand names to be heavily semantic-focused—phonetic translation is rarely used.[<a id="bib9up

For instance, [27] investigate the sales of foreign movies in Singapore and report that economic and cultural factors account for release frequencies and box office performance.

The former drives the extent to which product quality information and marketing activities in the home market can influence the foreign market. The latter is the brand name to which consumers in the foreign market are directly exposed. We capture these two influences through the overall similarity between the original brand name and the translated brand name as well as the informativeness of the translated brand name. We also examine how the effects of similarity and informativeness are moderated by three contingency factors: home-market performance, cultural gap, and time after release. Figure 1 presents the conceptual framework.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. Effects of brand name translation on cultural products.</p><a id="AN0142666422-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-7" title="Similarity Between Translated and Original Brand Names">Similarity Between Translated and Original Brand Names</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The theoretical underpinning for the effect of brand name similarity between the home market and international markets is as follows. When a product enters a foreign market, a similar brand name helps establish a connection in consumers' minds for the product across different markets. This generates both supply-side and demand-side benefits. On the supply side, similar to the situation of sales in sequential distribution channels ([49]), the effects of promotion and other marketing efforts in the home market are more likely to be transferred to the foreign market when the brand names are more similar. Internet and social media are both important facilitators of such information spillover. This essentially produces economy of scale for marketing investment ([58]) and helps generate "prerelease consumer buzz," which, according to [37], is composed of communication, search, and participation in experiential activities. On the demand side, similar brand names reduce the time to build brand recognition ([71]). Akin to the effect of brand extensions (when a new product is connected to an established one through the same brand name), sales of the new product can be increased through enhanced familiarity ([78]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These supply-side and demand-side benefits are significant for cultural products. In the case of movies, Hollywood studios spend, on average, an amount equivalent to 50% of a movie's production budget on domestic promotion (mostly network television and online advertising; [62]). The studios also engage in extensive public relations campaigns, often in partnership with the cast, to promote movies. The awareness and publicity generated by these efforts, in addition to buzz from the marketplace, will benefit the movie in international markets when this publicity can be more easily connected to the original movie. As we discussed previously, the cultural products' short life cycles dictates that awareness and consumer preference for them must be built quickly in international markets. Similar brand names help achieve these goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Hollywood movies in China, the connection between the original English title and the translated Chinese title is facilitated by the fact that many Chinese audiences are aware of the original title. A major driver behind this awareness is the global flow of entertainment news and information through both mainstream media and the internet. As in other countries, the majority of Chinese movie audiences are young—frequent moviegoers are under 35 years old and have a college education.[10] They have strong interests in entertainment products such as movies, TV shows, and video games from Western countries and are generally aware of these products' English titles ([69]). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Sales of a cultural product in a foreign country are higher if the brand name is more similar between the foreign market and the home market.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0142666422-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-8" title="Informativeness of Translated Brand Name">Informativeness of Translated Brand Name</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the broader literature on how brand names affect consumers, informativeness (or "suggestiveness," as used in some prior studies) refers to whether a brand name provides information about product attributes ([39]; [68]). Previous research has generally found a positive impact. For example, a more informative brand name generates a higher level of recall for brand advertising ([39]), better recognition of brand extensions ([68]), and better memory ([48]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For cultural products, the primary attribute that brand names help convey is the content (e.g., storyline, character, cast). As we have discussed, this content is the key selling point for cultural products ([24]; [75]). Consumers often seek content that reflects and reinforces certain psychological and sociological profiles related to their societies, cultures, personalities, and interests ([61]). Brand names that are more informative about content are thus more effective in drawing attention and communicating those features to consumers. Consequently, products with more informative brand names can expect faster information dissemination and greater awareness, interest, and purchase intention.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The informative roles that brand names play become even more important in international markets. Due to differences in languages, history, and traditions, consumers in a foreign country often need more information to appreciate the cultural background and social significance of a cultural product than do consumers in the home market. The disconnection between the home and foreign markets is commonly referred to as "cultural gap" ([36]). The basic idea is that a product can be valued to a lesser extent by foreign audiences who lack the cultural background and knowledge needed for full appreciation of the product ([46]). Take movies as an example. The names of certain people, events, and locations in the United States, such as those pertaining to the American Civil War, can trigger interest and emotion for domestic audiences who are aware of their significance. For foreign audiences who are unfamiliar with these names, however, some indication about the background or storyline through the movie title can provide useful guidance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, for cultural products in international markets, the informativeness of translated brand names for product content should have an important influence on product sales. We create the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Sales of a cultural product in a foreign market are higher if the translated brand name is more informative of product content.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0142666422-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-9" title="Synergy Between Similarity and Informativeness">Synergy Between Similarity and Informativeness</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because similarity and informativeness capture two different aspects of brand name translations, there could be a synergy effect between them beyond the individual effects hypothesized so far. When a higher level of similarity builds connection between the translated brand name and the original brand name, which generates both supply-side and demand-side benefits, the product will receive greater awareness and attention in the foreign market. This produces two different types of synergies. First, greater attention and awareness make it easier for consumers in the foreign country to notice the product. The translated brand name is one of the most salient elements of the product, and it is usually the first element to which consumers are exposed. Thus, the translated brand name will be more likely to receive attention, causing its characteristics (including informativeness) to have a greater impact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, when consumers pay more attention to the translated brand name, their ability to process the information contained in the brand name will increase. Consistent with the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, consumers will be more likely to process the translated brand name in a central or systematic route ([60]). The information contained in the brand name will thus have a greater impact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on these synergies, we propose that the effect of informativeness of the translated brand name will be enhanced if there is a greater similarity between the translated brand name and the original brand name. This is summarized in the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H3: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The (positive) effect of informativeness in the translated brand name on the sales of a cultural product is stronger when the translated and original brand names are more similar.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0142666422-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-10" title="Moderation by Home Market Performance and Cultural Gap">Moderation by Home Market Performance and Cultural Gap</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As Figure 1 shows, we also examine the roles of contingency factors that can moderate the effects of brand name translation. Developed on the basis of similar theoretical grounds as discussed in previous sections, these contingency effects provide further managerial guidance on brand name translations for different cultural products in international markets. For instance, <strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>H<sub>2</sub></strong> suggest that similarity and informativeness are both beneficial. While achieving both is possible for some products, it may be difficult do so for others. It is thus important to understand how a trade-off between the two objectives depends on specific product characteristics. Such a contingency view is an important contribution to the literature, which has focused on the main effects of brand name translations ([66]).</p><a id="AN0142666422-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-11" title="Effect of similarity moderated by home market performance">Effect of similarity moderated by home market performance</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We aim to understand under what conditions the connection established by similar brand names is more impactful on international sales. A product's home-market performance is a contingency factor that has important implications for the connection effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The theoretical base of similarity is the connection invoked in the minds of foreign consumers between the translated brand name and the original brand name. As a corollary of such connections, consumer perception of the product in the foreign market should be influenced by product success in the home market. The more successful the product is in the home market, the more positively foreign consumers will react when it is introduced overseas. Conversely, if the product is less successful in the home market, foreign consumers will be less enthusiastic about it.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For movies in international markets, domestic box office revenue is by definition the home-market performance. Because of the experiential nature of movies, quality is difficult to judge prior to consumption ([53]). Therefore, consumers often seek product quality signals to help them make purchase decisions.

For audiences in a foreign country, the linkage of an imported movie to the movie's home-market performance becomes stronger when the original title and translated title are more similar, because greater similarity enhances the perceptual connection in consumers' minds between the home-market version and the overseas version of the movie. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H4: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The (positive) effect of similarity between translated brand name and original brand names on the sales of a cultural product in a foreign market is stronger when the product has higher sales in the home market.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0142666422-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-12" title="Effect of informativeness moderated by cultural gap">Effect of informativeness moderated by cultural gap</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong>H<sub>2</sub></strong> hypothesizes that a higher level of informativeness in translated brand names enhances sales because it conveys more content information to consumers in international markets. Consistent with this reasoning, the <em>need</em> for suggesting content should be an important contingency factor for the informative effect. Some cultural products are more deeply rooted in the social and cultural background of the home country than others, making it more difficult to be understood by foreign audiences and thus to attract attention. The 2016 <em>Ben-Hur</em> remake and its performance in China provide an illustration. The movie is an adaptation of a classic novel (<em>Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ</em>) and has a religious setting; both the novel and the religious context are rather unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. The movie generated a box office of only 17.48 million RMB, which is equivalent to less than 10% of its U.S. box office sales. Other examples include movies such as the 1993 history drama <em>Gettysburg</em>, which is based on the battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War, and the 2018 drama <em>Beautiful Boy</em>, which explores the experiences of a family coping with addiction. Although U.S. audiences can relate to the Civil War and addiction problems, audiences in other countries may be unfamiliar with these issues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When there is a greater cultural gap between the cultural product and the foreign market, it becomes more valuable to use the brand name to provide "hints" for foreign audiences. The return will be better understanding of the product, greater appreciation of its value, and higher purchase intention. We thus create the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The (positive) effect of informativeness in the translated brand name on the sales of a cultural product in a foreign market is stronger if there is a larger cultural gap between the product and the foreign market.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0142666422-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-13" title="Temporal Dynamics in the Effects">Temporal Dynamics in the Effects</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because translated brand names help convey information to consumers about product quality (via similarity) and content (via informativeness), the impact of different translations should depend on consumers' need for product information. When consumers have other ways of learning about the product, such need is reduced, and the effects of brand names will be smaller. This is consistent with the idea that product information is most impactful when consumers have few alternative learning channels ([28]). In addition to the availability of alternative product-related information, the amount of time that has passed since product launch is also a factor. Thus, we argue that the effects of brand name translation will exhibit temporal dynamics and change over time.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In general, there is more limited information when a new product is introduced than after the product becomes more widely adopted. Much of the early information is in the forms of adverting, public relations, and other firm-initiated communication. As the product continues to sell, a greater amount of alternative information—especially word of mouth, which has important impacts on consumers—becomes available. The need for product-related information is thus greater in the earlier stage of product sales than in the later stage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These temporal patterns hold for cultural products ([13]; [82]) and in international markets. When the product is first introduced, foreign consumers will rely to a large extent on observable product attributes, among which brand name is highly salient, to judge product quality and content. Thus, the effects of similarity and informativeness related to the translated brand name should be higher. As time passes, other information, including reviews and consumer word of mouth, will become prevalent such that the impact of the brand name reduces.

Three coders proficient in both Chinese and English independently rated the overall level of similarity between the translated Chinese movie title and the original English movie title on a seven-point scale (1 = "not at all similar," and 7 = "very similar"). Unlike the studies that focused on a semantic–phonetic perspective ([81]; [84]), we take a more holistic approach so that similarity can occur in meaning, sound, or both. This is also theoretically important because meaning similarity and sound similarity can both elicit the connection between the original and translated movie titles. Ratings from the three coders were highly consistent with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) at.84 (F = 6.32, <em>p</em> &lt;.01) ([18]). For each movie, we take the average score of these three coders as the similarity measure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We followed a similar rating procedure to rate the degree of <em>informativeness</em> for the translated movie titles. We obtained the synopsis for each movie from Douban. The movie titles and synopses were then provided to three coders who were different from the previous coders of similarity. For each movie, they independently rated the extent to which the Chinese title reflects the movie storyline, as described in the synopsis, on a seven-point scale (1 = "does not reflect the storyline at all," and 7 = "fully reflects the storyline"). The ratings were again highly consistent (ICC =.74, F = 4.03, <em>p</em> &lt;.01). As with similarity, we take the average score of the three coders as the informativeness measure for each movie.

We follow [23] to obtain each movie's gross box office revenue in the United States from The Numbers (<a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/">www.the-numbers.com</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Movie genre is a key characteristic for coding <em>cultural gap</em>. Prior research has shown that drama, comedy, horror, musical, and Western movies are overall more content intensive and have greater country-specific elements than other genres ([20]; [26]; [46]). They are thus associated with a higher level of cultural gap than other genres. In contrast, action, adventure, and thriller movies tend to have universal appeal across cultures ([40]; [47]; [57]). For instance, by analyzing box office performances of selected movie genres in the United States versus in Hong Kong, [46] finds that comedies exhibit a high degree of cultural gap, whereas action movies are associated with low cultural gap. We thus code a dummy variable for <em>cultural gap</em> that equals 1 for drama, comedy, horror, musical, or Western movies and 0 for other movie types.[12]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to the movie literature discussed previously, our data provide additional evidence for this genre classification. We calculated the correlation coefficient between consumer review scores in the United States (i.e., from IMDb) and consumer review scores in China (i.e., from Douban) for each Hollywood movie in our sample. We found that, consistent with the cultural gap classification, U.S. audiences and Chinese audiences are more similar at evaluating action, adventure, and thriller movies than drama, comedy, horror, musical, and Western movies (correlation coefficient =.68 vs..57).</p><a id="AN0142666422-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-18" title="Control Variables">Control Variables</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has extensively studied the drivers of movie box office revenue.[13] First, we control for <em>the number of weeks that have passed since the movie's release</em> to capture the common "decay effect" of movie sales over time ([21]). We also follow the literature to include the following movie characteristics as controls in the estimation: <em>weekly number of screens</em> ([23]); <em>production budget</em> ([14]); <em>gap between U.S. and Chinese releases</em> ([23]); <em>whether the movie is a sequel</em> ([52]); <em>consumer word of mouth</em> (proxied by consumer review score; [15]; [53]); <em>whether the movie cast includes a star</em>, which equals 1 if any member of the cast or the director has been nominated for or won an Academy Award, and 0 otherwise ([22]); <em>whether the movie is distributed by a major U.S. studio</em> ([23])[14]; a set of <em>dummy variables for</em><em>MPAA ratings</em> ([<a id="bib5up

A particular factor is the degree of clarity (or ambiguity) in the original title.[15] A clearer title is more revealing about the content and is more likely to translated with a higher degree of standardization. Therefore, we construct a variable to measure the degree of clarity in the original title in English for movies in our sample. We recruited three native English speakers who work as English teachers at a major university in Shanghai. We provided them with the list of English movies titles and the synopsis of each movie, obtained from IMDb. Using a seven-point scale, they independently rated whether a movie title clearly describes the information in the synopsis (1 = "totally unclear," and 7 = "totally clear"). Interrater reliability is high (ICC =.77, F = 5.19, <em>p</em> &lt;.01). The average rating is used for each movie.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Movie box office sales are well known for seasonality. We include in our estimation three sets of time-related fixed effects: week (52 dummy variables for each week of the year), year (a dummy variable for each year in the sample period), and Chinese public holidays. Because the public holidays are mostly based on the traditional (lunar) Chinese calendar, they are at different dates in different years. Thus, holiday fixed effects need to be separately accounted for beyond week and year fixed effects.

They tend to have more limited screening intensity in China. Even though they belong to the high cultural gap category along with drama and comedy, they could be associated with different audience preferences. It is useful to examine how movie title translation effects, especially those pertaining to the moderation by cultural gap, may change if we exclude these three genres. Thus, we reestimated the model using a sample that excludes horror, musical, and Western movies.

However, unlike the U.S. domestic market, where movies are promoted heavily before they are released, movie advertising is not yet a major activity in China—in terms of both budget and managerial attention, advertising falls far behind production and exhibition in the Chinese film industry. For instance, while movie budgets in the United States spend a substantial amount of money to advertise on network television, TV advertising for movies is very limited in China. A report by <em>China Daily</em> indicates that movies in China seldom use television advertising due to its high cost and their overall low promotional budgets.[16] In fact, online ticket platforms and social media, rather than ads, are the most prevalent sources of movie information for Chinese consumers.[17] Thus, the impact of advertising on Chinese movie sales should not be as important as that for movies in the U.S. market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From the analysis perspective, recall that we have explicitly controlled for production budget in our estimations. Because movie advertising spending is often in proportion to production budget (e.g., [15]; [53]), the impact of not including advertising spending per se should be minimal. Moreover, because systematic reporting of movie industry information is still nascent in China, it is very difficult to obtain reliable data for movie advertising spending.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To test whether our main results remain robust when advertising is controlled for, an option is to utilize some proxies of advertising effects. In lieu of advertising data, we were able to obtain from EntGroup the number of news articles that appeared on major news media for 184 of the 317 movies in the data set. Because advertising generates publicity for movies and news media coverage is one of the best ways to measure publicity ([11]), we can include the amount of new media coverage in the estimation as a direct control for advertising effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because the advertising budget is usually set in proportion to the production budget, we follow prior research to regress the amount of news coverage on production budget and then employ the residuals in the estimation to isolate the impact due to advertising ([51]). Because the limited news data significantly reduce the sample size (from 317 to 184), this estimation provides a strong test of whether our main results hold.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As Column 4, Table 5, shows, advertising as proxied by news media publicity has a positive impact on box office sales. Even with a sample size that is less than 60% of the full sample, our main results remain robust: the effects of brand name translation strategies and their moderation effects are similar to the findings in Table 4.</p><a id="AN0142666422-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-32" title="Summary and Discussion">Summary and Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article examines how the brand naming strategy for cultural products affects consumer demand in international markets.

There is also a positive interaction (synergy) effect between similarity and informativeness. We show that two key product characteristics moderate the brand name effects: the similarity effect is stronger for Hollywood movies with better performances in the home (i.e., the U.S.) market, while the informativeness effect is stronger for movies that have a larger cultural gap from the foreign market.

While each strategy can be managed to influence the sales in international markets, there is also a synergy between them—one strategy becomes more effective if the other strategy is also implemented.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, our results indicate that these branding strategies are most effective for product sales in the early period after introduction. This is particularly important for managers given the short life cycle of cultural products. It is critical for companies to be sensitive to brand name translation early and to ensure that similarity, informativeness, or both are in place before introduction to help increase sales quickly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the outcome will be the best if a company can achieve both higher similarity and higher informativeness in its translated brand name, especially considering that similarity and informativeness in one translated brand name can have positive synergy effects to further increase product sales. However, there could be situations in which achieving both goals in one brand name is difficult because they may require different brand name features and translation techniques. Therefore, companies need to make trade-offs between similarity and informativeness. Our study provides the following guidelines for the trade-off. If the product has high home-market performance but small cultural gap, the translation should focus on brand name similarity. If the product has low home-market performance but large cultural gap, the translation should focus on informativeness. If the product has both high home-market performance and large cultural gap, both similarity and informativeness will be highly effective in generating sales. Thus, the company should pay attention to both strategies, with the relative emphasis between the two decided on the basis of the effect size and the feasibility of each strategy. Finally, if the product has low home-market performance and small cultural gap, both strategies will still be helpful but will not be highly effective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Fourth, related to the trade-off between similarity and informativeness, companies can follow our analysis to estimate the effect size of the moderating factors. They can then more precisely evaluate the extent to which product sales will benefit from either strategy so that a sensible trade-off can be made.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To gain further managerial insights from our results, we use the parameter estimates to quantify the magnitude of the impact of Hollywood movie title translation on Chinese box office revenues. For illustration purposes, we compute the effect size for the scenarios where movie title similarity or informativeness would increase by one point on the seven-point scale. We do so for all the Hollywood movies in the sample, and for different movie categories and across different time periods. The values of other variables not simulated are set at the sample mean.

Calculations are based on estimation results in Column 3 of Table 4. The values of other variables not simulated are set at the sample mean.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 6, Panel A, shows the effects of movie title translation across all movies. If the degree of similarity of translated movie titles increases by one point, the average box office revenue would increase by 3.60%, or 10.18 million RMB. If the degree of informativeness in movie title translation increases by one point, the average box office revenue of these movies would increase by 2.83%, or 8.01 million RMB.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 6, Panel B, illustrates the heterogeneous effects of similarity and informativeness for different types of movies (i.e., by home-market performance and degree of cultural gap). In terms of home-market performance, we median-split the sample and compare the movies with a U.S. box office revenue above the sample median with those below. Recall that similarity in movie title translations facilitates the connection between home and foreign markets. For a one-point increase in the degree of similarity, Hollywood movies with higher-than-median U.S. box office revenue would see a 4.35% increase in Chinese box office revenue. That is equivalent to 19.45 million RMB for these movies. However, movies with lower-than-median U.S. box office revenue would see an increase of only 3.30% (or 3.88 million RMB). Clearly, the benefit of similarity is more significant for movies with better home-market success.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of cultural gap, the relevant brand name translation strategy is the degree of informativeness. For a one-point increase in informativeness, movies with large cultural gap would see a more substantial increase of 8.78% (or 10.25 million RMB) in Chinese box office revenue than the movies with small cultural gap (2.38%, or 7.82 million RMB). Increasing informativeness is thus a more effective strategy for large cultural gap movies than for those with small cultural gap.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, Table 6, Panel C, focuses on the temporal effects, using the first and second weeks of release as illustration. For a one-point increase in similarity, the Chinese box office revenue would increase by 4.56% (5.89 million RMB) for a movie in its first week of release and 1.64% (1.67 million RMB) for the second week. For a one-point increase in informativeness, the Chinese box office revenue would increase by 5.57% (7.20 million RMB) for the first week and 1.48% (1.50 million RMB) for the second week.

As studios continue to pay attention to international markets, it becomes increasingly important for them to implement strategies that would maximize global box office revenue. Maximizing revenues in multiple countries requires foresight, planning, and scientific methods. It is particularly challenging given that the studios do not fully control either the exporting or foreign exhibition decisions. It is beyond the scope of our article to address the issue of global revenue maximization; however, it would be interesting for future research to study how casting, release timing, promotion, and movie title strategies may affect global box office revenue.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, it would be fruitful to examine how movie title translations interact with other movie marketing activities, such as the use of movie trailers. For example, are more informative trailers and more suggestive movie title translations complements or substitutes for each other? Similar to [74] suggestion about integrating verbal and visual elements of marketing campaigns, addressing this question will provide insights on how verbal (movie titles) and visual (movie trailers) aspects of cultural product marketing interact with each other to influence product sales in both home and international markets.</p><a id="AN0142666422-35"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0142666422-35" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, jm.18.0270-File003 - Branding Cultural Products in International Markets: A Study of Hollywood Movies in China</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, jm.18.0270-File003 for Branding Cultural Products in International Markets: A Study of Hollywood Movies in China by Weihe Gao, Li Ji, Yong Liu and Qi Sun in Journal of Marketing</p><a id="AN0142666422-36"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0142666422-36" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Author ContributionsThe authors are listed alphabetically and contributed equally.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  Associate EditorJan-Benedict E.M.

Brands are shifting away from single ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas, people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (<a id="bib1up

Throughout the article, the authors also identify future research issues that require scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: brands; branding; brand management; brand equity; cocreation; digital branding; hyperconnectivity; networks; platforms</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Over the course of a century, branding has moved from an occasionally studied activity to a major concern for both business and society. Traditional commercial brands are omnipresent and compete for consumer attention with newer branded entities, such as platform brands (e.g., Airbnb), direct-to-consumer brands (e.g., Warby Parker), smart brands (e.g., Google Nest), idea brands (e.g., #MeToo), and person brands (e.g., Kim Kardashian). The manner in which consumers interact with brands is also changing due to the rise of digitally native brands, the ubiquitous access to information and products via digital and mobile channels, and the broad availability of smart, connected devices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To inspire next-generation conceptual and empirical work on branding, this article examines how existing perspectives need to be refocused and rethought to address the realities of contemporary society. We examine broader types of entities, ranging from smart branded devices and entities that operate in networks of brands to ideas and person brands. We also investigate the blurring of brand boundaries brought about by technology-induced hyperconnectivity. In doing so, we expand on new frontiers in branding research and argue that these topics need to be a larger part of research agendas.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our review of the marketing literature suggests that extant theoretical perspectives—from the vantage points of the firm, the consumer, and society—have resulted in certain models and assumptions that may no longer be adequate or sufficient in a hyperconnected world. The concept of hyperconnectivity refers to the proliferation of networks of people, devices, and other entities, as well as the continuous access to other people, machines, and organizations, regardless of time or location ([42]; [103]). In this environment, information is always accessible and abundant, search costs are low, goods and services from across geographic boundaries are easier to reach than ever, and firms may no longer be the primary source of information about brands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Hyperconnectivity has led to two major changes in branding. First, brands are shifting away from single to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand experiences and brand meanings alongside traditional brand owners (or entities who market the brand). We call this phenomenon the "blurring of branding boundaries." Second, hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities are further stretching the branding space, which constitutes a "broadening of branding boundaries."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we elaborate on the consequences of hyperconnectivity on the "blurring" and "broadening" of branding boundaries. We focus on both challenges and opportunities that brands face in a hyperconnected environment. We first briefly review three core perspectives that have underscored traditional branding research and then examine the implications of this expanded view of brands through three fundamental questions: (<a id="bib1up

We distinguish three theoretical perspectives (firm, consumer, and society) and two approaches within each perspective. The firm perspective views brands as assets and examines the various functions and roles that brands serve for firms, both strategically and financially. The consumer perspective views brands as signals (economic approach) and mental knowledge cues (psychological approach). The society perspective presents brands in societal and cultural contexts affecting individual consumers both directly and indirectly through social forces, structures, and institutions. The sociology of brands applies to all manner of commercial and noncommercial entities (e.g., ideas, people). We briefly introduce each perspective in this section while acknowledging the overlap and spillovers of knowledge across various approaches used in the literature. One source of this overlap comes from the nested structure that underlies how these perspectives relate to each other. For example, societal macroenvironments host institutions (including the firm) that, in turn, interact to shape consumer-level outcomes.</p><a id="AN0141626360-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-3" title="Firm Perspective">Firm Perspective</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0141626360-4"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-4" title="Strategic approach">Strategic approach</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Key issues examined in this approach include the development and implementation of brand identity; positioning, targeting, launch, and growth of brands; brand portfolio architecture; and management of brands across geographic boundaries ([59]; [118]).

Other mental representations include affect and emotions, leading to constructs such as brand trust ([104]), emotional brand attachment ([132]), brand coolness ([141]), and even brand love ([12]).

Sociological models are typically dynamic and recursive. Sociological scholars do not view brands as static entities or as mere information sources or knowledge structures; rather, they have a keen interest in how brand meanings are generated, changed, and dynamically reinvented. An important notion in this literature is brand community, a nongeographic space in which admirers of a brand connect with one another and demonstrate all three necessary distinctions of community: consciousness of kind, rituals and traditions, and moral obligation ([89]).</p><a id="AN0141626360-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-11" title="Cultural approach">Cultural approach</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Both sociologists and anthropologists study culture, and their work in branding and marketing meaningfully intersects. One of the main insights from this research is that branded goods, as cultural meaning producers, enhance consumers' lives ([84]). Probably the best-known perspective on how brands become popular through their production of cultural capital is the widespread adaptation of [16] in consumer culture theory ([129]). Among other things, consumer culture theory addresses the dynamic relationships among consumer actions, the marketplace, and cultural meanings. Research in this stream focuses on how iconic brands ([52]), or brands infused with cultural referents ([22]), contribute to culturally bound consumption practices ([33]). Invoking the same dynamic, these scholars demonstrate how antibrand activists and other cultural intermediaries can introduce a competing set of brand meanings (e.g., doppelgaünger brand images) that can significantly influence consumer behavior and market creation ([44]; [128]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We summarize key insights from each perspective (firm, consumer, and society) in Table WA1 in the Web Appendix. As this table is structured by substreams of research, it also illustrates how several of the theoretical perspectives have helped advance each area of inquiry. We next leverage these perspectives into a discussion of how the boundaries of branding have blurred and broadened in response to changes occurring in a hyperconnected environment.

The broad and fast access to information calls into question foundational assumptions of several of the theoretical perspectives we discussed in the previous section. For example, high search costs and information asymmetry have been the core assumptions of the economic view of brands as signaling mechanisms ([35]; [142]). However, brands may no longer serve as primary signals of quality in an environment in which search costs are low and information asymmetry is reduced by various stakeholders who abundantly share opinions about brands across their networks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because access to information is much easier in a hyperconnected world, consumers need to expend less effort in learning information about brands. Models of memory activation and learning need to be updated to account for consumers' increased reliance on external sources of information as opposed to information that is retrieved from memory. Moreover, the sheer volume of external information can lead to information overload—a situation in which not all communication input can be processed and used ([18]; [113]). The velocity and volume of information that consumers are exposed to, along with the potential information overload that results from it, reduce brands' ability to capture the attention of their target segment ([74]), which calls for a reexamination of models of attention.</p><a id="AN0141626360-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-14" title="Networks of People and Devices, and Growth of Platforms">Networks of People and Devices, and Growth of Platforms</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The rise of networks of people and devices and the development of platform technology have led to an environment in which brands and their meanings are cocreated. Firms are not the only entities that can disseminate branded information quickly and broadly—they now compete with other stakeholders who can do so just as easily (e.g., [71]). Brand conversations are happening online, and consumers may listen to their peers or to online influencers just as much as, if not more than, they listen to branded messages generated by firms. A growing stream of research is documenting the effect of this loss of control on brand meaning ([24]; [40]) and brand experiences ([100]).</p><a id="AN0141626360-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-15" title="Device-to-Device Connectivity">Device-to-Device Connectivity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Device-to-device connectivity has affected brands in several ways.

Today, as information becomes available widely across multiple channels, consumers' attention is scattered across many media and channels, forcing a multitude of branded entities to compete to gain consumers' awareness and potentially to form an emotional connection. As brand meaning is increasingly cocreated, it is even sometimes hijacked by consumers and firm partners ([40]; [144]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond the cocreation of brand meaning, brand stakeholders (ranging from customers and employees to firm partners, communities, and society at large) are increasingly shaping various aspects of product and marketing-mix activities. For example, firms that use a platform-based business model often bring together partners that help cocreate the entire brand experience. Alternatively, firms that allow their products to interact with voice-controlled smart devices such as Amazon's Echo or with home automation hubs such as Wink Hub are also relinquishing some control, as brand associations can transfer to and from these partner brands to the focal one with potentially serious consequences for brands' performance and business survival ([145]). The blurring of brand boundaries is a key consequence of the rise of the sharing economy, which "offers temporary access as an alternative to permanent ownership" ([32], p.2), and which has expanded the role of customers to span both the demand and supply sides.</p><a id="AN0141626360-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-18" title="Broadening of Branding">Broadening of Branding</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As marketers are losing some control over the meaning consumers associate with brands, more brand-related stakeholders are involved in shaping brand associations.

The reach of both traditional brands and newer branded entities has also broadened to include stakeholders who have not necessarily been consistently targeted in the past, such as employees, donors, partners, citizen-voters, and activists, as well as local communities, governments, and society as a whole.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The role of brands has also broadened, with commercial brands increasingly expected to have a mission (or purpose) beyond shareholder value maximization.

As technology has vastly improved access to information, products, and people, these existing conceptions of brands need to be reassessed—that is, refocused, rethought, or abandoned altogether. We discuss future directions for this reassessment in the remainder of this subsection (see Table 1).</p><a id="AN0141626360-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-21" title="Brands as Weak Quality Signals">Brands as Weak Quality Signals</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the past, when consumers were faced with information asymmetry and imperfect information, brands served as quality signals that facilitated consumer choice. However, in a hyperconnected economy in which consumers can easily access information about brands using online channels, information asymmetry between brand owners and consumers has decreased, as search costs are lower ([75]). Thus, a brand's quality signal could face interference from alternative signals of quality derived from the collective reviews and opinions available online.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers need to understand the conditions under which consumers still trust firm communications about brands (vs. information intermediaries such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Rotten Tomatoes) and the impact of firm-generated versus marketplace-generated brand information on brand trust. How can firms manage a brand communication process that faces significant signal interference? How can brands shift the balance in their favor if the signals generated by the marketplace are mixed, reflecting a high level of consumer heterogeneity?

Studies have proposed and tested multiple models of learning about brands, leveraging the notion that brands can act as cues that access knowledge held in consumers' memories ([57]). As consumers increasingly process information in a hyperconnected and attention-scarce environment, understanding of brand information processing may need to be augmented and extended ([146]). Existing dual-processing models (visual or verbal, heuristic or systematic, piece-by-piece or holistic; [114]) assume that consumers can switch back and forth in real time from one channel to another and from one processing style to another. As consumers utilize multiple devices and channels in the context of hyperconnectivity, dual-processing models need to be further refined to examine how and when people switch from one processing style to another and how simultaneous processing of information from multiple devices or channels occurs over time (e.g., when consumers engage in multitasking).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brand information processing models should also consider how sensory information contributes to brand awareness and choice. The impact of sensory information on processing of brand information has been previously investigated (e.g., [66]; [67]). For example, [109] show that familiar brands are preferred in online settings (relative to offline) when sensory information is diagnostic and plays a role in brand choice. However, hyperconnectivity offers additional research opportunities in this area. Although many brands are experienced online in an arguably less sensorial environment, companies now have access to multisensory and highly interactive new technologies that appeal to multiple senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell) simultaneously. For instance, sensory-rich retail environments, as well as augmented and virtual reality, allow people to experience the power of multisensory stimulation and consider brands in environments that may be dynamic and virtual. Online stores such as Wayfair, Amazon, and Target have launched mobile augmented-reality apps that allow consumers to shop for furniture by placing items in their own room settings ([97]). In sensory-rich environments, the voluntary attention to brand stimuli and sensory cues may be more difficult to elicit and more likely to be replaced by involuntary attention or arousal to stimuli unrelated to the focal brand. Therefore, current models need to be revised to incorporate the paucity of consumers' voluntary attention and also account for the possibility that the role of sensory cues may change how brand information is processed.</p><a id="AN0141626360-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-23" title="Brands as Instruments of Identity Expression">Brands as Instruments of Identity Expression</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brands can be used to support a desired consumer identity and may be associated with humanlike traits (referred to as "brand personality"; [76]). The identity view of brands is based on the notion that brands become imbued with associations through their use. For example, consumers can use these brand associations in an instrumental way to construct and signal something about their own identity ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref89" title="2">2</a>]), whereas employees can use corporate brands owned by their employer to convey professional status or to send a signal about their expertise ([124]). The identity view has more recently focused on the complex nature of identity, with brands being tied to multiple individual and group-based identities ([36]; [123]), as well as being symbolic of culture ([133]). The consumer culture literature has also considered the instrumental role of brands as authenticating narratives for consumers' "identity projects" (e.g., [128]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A consequence of hyperconnectivity is that consumers can now adopt multiple personae on their devices and change their identities frequently ([134]). As consumers increasingly spend time online, there is the potential for their online (or "virtual") self and their offline (or "true") self to diverge, possibly leading to identity conflict ([121]). The multiple (sometimes conflicting) dynamic identities of consumers, particularly across online and offline settings, require rethinking about how to leverage brands to build identities ([106]). Can brand associations be constructed and revised to allow for a more flexible view of identity, or would this create confusion from the perspective of the user or those who view such signals? Would consumers prefer that brands have a well-defined meaning that helps them anchor and retrieve one particular facet of their identity, with greater potential for sending stronger signals about a particular self, or would they be drawn more to malleable brands that accommodate a broader range of self-expression? A multidisciplinary approach that leverages both the consumer and society perspectives could examine the manner in which social groups can use brands in instrumental ways to achieve their social goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, hyperconnectivity can facilitate access to a broader set of brands in the digital space that can be used by consumers to express their identity. This would afford consumers a richer set of identity-building tools. At the same time, digital possessions have been shown to have lower self-relevance ([11]), which calls into question the strength of identification with brands in the digital space. Additional questions center on how consumers choose brands to identify with in this online, hyperconnected environment and the nature of relationships that consumers form with brands.</p><a id="AN0141626360-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-24" title="Brands as Containers of Socially Constructed Meaning">Brands as Containers of Socially Constructed Meaning</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers using a sociological lens have examined the role of brands as arbiters of social trends, as catalysts for social interaction, and as societal symbols in the case of brands that attain iconic status (e.g., [51]). Brands are expanding their social role, however, by increasingly becoming activist tools aligned with various social and political issues. Purpose-driven branding argues that brands should uphold societal values because doing so gives consumers an opportunity to use them in instrumental ways to show support for social causes. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble's recent Gillette "The Best Men Can Be" and "My Black Is Beautiful" campaigns took controversial positions with regard to gender and racial stereotypes, respectively ([58]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is tempting for brands that want to remain relevant, particularly in the eyes of millennial consumers, to take a stance on important social issues, but prescriptions on how to do so effectively are lacking. Yet it is increasingly clear that "the future of brands is also inextricably tied to the future of society" ([25], p. 246), and brands can act as vehicles for bringing about social change. As hyperconnectivity can amplify brands' social message, scholarly insights are necessary to understand the role of brands as purpose-driven entities and how firms can best align the social message of brands with the desired brand associations. The consumer and society perspectives could be utilized in exploring the implications of brand conversations and brand engagement for stronger social connections, as well as other determinants and consequences of this "social brand engagement" ([65]).</p><a id="AN0141626360-25"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-25" title="Brands as Architects of Value in Networks">Brands as Architects of Value in Networks</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Marketing scholars have extensively investigated brand partnerships and alliances from a dyadic perspective ([98]; [116]). However, in a hyperconnected environment, brands are increasingly embedded in complex networks consisting of users, partners, cocreators, and co-owners. Prior research that has examined the performance impact of networks on value creation at the firm level ([122]) can be extended to show how brands can extract value from their position in the network.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Leveraging network theoretic constructs to examine value creation in branded networks is a useful avenue for future research. Brands can provide value in networks in at least two ways. Due to advanced search and navigation capabilities, brands can simplify users' navigation through brand-embedded networks, thus contributing to seamless user experiences on online platforms. Furthermore, brands can create value by ensuring compatibility across branded entities in the network, in terms of both attributes and quality standards.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A case in point is Apple, a company that strives to make its products compatible with a broad range of complementary devices and ensures that all applications sold in the App Store meet its stringent quality standards. But not all brands can easily extend their networks; for instance, Google failed to successfully launch Google Health, a platform where consumers could consolidate their health information and interact with providers. As noted by [136], participants on both sides of the platform were not ready to engage at a level that would render the platform successful.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Additional research is necessary to identify strategies that brands can adopt to enhance the effective functioning of the brand ecosystem. The traditional conceptualization of user experience that relies primarily on product or service usage could be broadened to include interactions across an entire network or ecosystem that is linked to a specific brand. We term this "brand network user experience." A better understanding of the brand network user experience and how consumers derive utility from such a network is warranted. Finally, brands can not only help organize informational content on networks but also serve as gatekeepers of information (or products) they want consumers to see or purchase. The ongoing spread of "fake news" on social media platforms highlights the potentially critical (and controversial) role of branded platforms as entities that censor harmful content or products; how brands can achieve this role and perhaps derive value from it should be the focus of further research.</p><a id="AN0141626360-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-26" title="Brands as Catalysts of Communities">Brands as Catalysts of Communities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers have examined brand communities and how they deliver value to their members ([89]) and affect the cocreation process. In this context, brands serve as catalysts of social interaction and community through shared consciousness and brand use, loyalty, and engagement among community members ([60]). Hyperconnectivity has increased the potential for individuals to establish and join brand communities, be it newer types that are appearing on social networks or communities established by traditional brands online, such as the Sephora or Jeep brand communities, in which users post reviews and share information about brands and their new products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">New research on how brand communities emerge in a hyperconnected environment and what type of governance can make such potentially large communities successful is a worthwhile avenue for research. Branded communities can create value not only by enhancing the brand experience for users but also by providing firms with a forum to test out new ideas, collect feedback on brand actions, and better understand how brands are consumed. Brand communities may also offer social benefits, particularly in the context of growing social isolation and "aloneness" in society (e.g., [134]). Thus, it would be valuable to understand how brand communities can help combat loneliness despite the larger scale of social connections facilitated by hyperconnectivity.</p><a id="AN0141626360-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-27" title="Brands as Arbiters of Controversy">Brands as Arbiters of Controversy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to the role of brands as signals or nodes in memory, brands have been construed as symbols ([70]). These symbols could be used in various forms of self-presentation to give meaning to consumers and their social position (e.g., [46]). While not denying their other functions, [70], p. 205) states that "things people buy are seen to have personal and social meanings" and that people use branded symbols to reinforce their view of self (both actual and ideal).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When brands are strong enough to serve as symbols, some also transition into roles of arbiters of controversy within the identity and sociopolitical realms. These brands often adopt controversial stances on key topics such as feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial issues and, in doing so, appeal to consumers at the epicenter of cultural controversy. Nike's use of Colin Kaepernick's cause was widely debated but is now deemed as having galvanized thought on the issues of social justice and race in sports, particularly considering that such a large percentage of professional athletes are nonwhite. Nike was awarded the 2018 Marketer of the Year for the campaign by <em>Advertising Age</em> ([99]), and Nike's profits and stock valuations have climbed in the aftermath of this controversial stance. In this way, brands appear to have a stronger voice in a hyperconnected world, in which their messages on social and political issues can quickly spread and multiply. With a stronger voice comes the added responsibility of addressing important social issues in ways that can help society move forward.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Hyperconnectivity has not only afforded brands the opportunity to have a stronger voice but also reduced their ability to stay "above the fray" on controversial topics. Absent a stance on such topics, consumers with deep brand connections may question the authenticity of the brand. Research has shown that perceived brand authenticity has four dimensions: continuity, credibility, integrity, and symbolism ([88]). Integrity, which captures a brand's intentions and the values it communicates, along with symbolism, which reflects values that are meaningful to consumers, are particularly relevant in situations where brands face conflict. Failing to take a clear stance may lower perceptions of brand integrity and foster identity conflict among those consumers who use the brand in symbolic ways to communicate certain values. At the extreme, activist consumers can punish passive brands: for example, activist consumers and movements fueled by them, such as #GrabYourWallet, have caused retailers to drop certain brands or companies to drop their top executives, as was the case with the #DeleteUber movement, which led the then-chief executive officer of Uber—Travis Kalanick—to step down from the company ([13]). In this way, brands that try to avoid conflict can become the target of activist consumers who yield a louder megaphone in a hyperconnected environment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research in the context of brands as arbiters of controversy is only in its infancy. Many questions remain unanswered. For example, how does brands' participation in controversy (political or social) affect their customer base? How do message content and the emotional tone of messages in a controversy affect brand perceptions? How does brands' participation in controversial issues propagate on social media, and what is the role of the structure of their online social network (e.g., network centrality, network density) in the spread of brand information following a crisis incident? What new metrics (e.g., polarization, controversy score) can track the nature of conversation about brands in controversial settings?</p><a id="AN0141626360-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-28" title="Brands as Stewards of Data Privacy">Brands as Stewards of Data Privacy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As brand boundaries become blurred, data that brands can access about their customers have increased, shedding new light on what drives consumer attitudes and behavior. These data are a potential source of value for branded entities, which can use them to better target and customize their offerings to consumers. At the same time, increased access to customer data poses legal and ethical challenges, as consumers have grown more concerned about the confidentiality and security of their data ([120]). Brands that have misused customer data (or suffered from data breaches) have faced significant backlash and penalties from consumers and public policy officials.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Policy makers and consumers have begun emphasizing the important role of governmental regulations in moderating privacy concerns. Concomitantly, scholars have shown greater interest in understanding the implications of recent privacy regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation in Europe) for both customers and firms ([47]). As data themselves become a resource, understanding the implications of privacy concerns for brands and the trade-offs inherent in achieving greater personalization through data versus ensuring data privacy is a topic that needs greater research attention ([<a id="bib5up

So far, cocreation research has focused mostly on new product cocreation ([53]; [137]), but recent work has begun examining the cocreation of brand experiences ([94]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, cocreation of the brand experience often occurs on digital platforms, defined as enterprises that "use the Internet to facilitate economically beneficial interactions between two or more independent groups of users" ([29], p. 8). Examples of digital platform brands are Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn, among others. Most digital platforms are branded, and their brand associations result from the interactions of multiple players who contribute to the creation and delivery of the brand experience. For example, property owners on Airbnb contribute to the success of the brand experience as much as the technology that enables this platform. Emerging research on platforms has focused primarily on the structure of such exchanges ([100]) and how to monetize them ([68]) rather than on how the interactions between the firm and its stakeholders shape the brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Recent research highlights the unique drivers of engagement for platform brands ([32]), but there are other important branding aspects of cocreation on digital platforms worthy of further research. For instance, how should firms design an optimal governance mechanism that will still allow them to maintain reasonable control over brand reputation and meaning? How can firms influence platform participants to reinforce the brand message and deliver a brand experience consistent with this message? What differential branding benefits (e.g., awareness, preference, resonance) accrue from the various types of platform designs (e.g., open vs. closed, centralized vs. decentralized)? Are branded platforms in the shared economy disrupting employment, and if so, what are the societal consequences of these disruptions and subsequent impact on the brand?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More generally, researchers should try to understand how much control firms should relinquish over the brand experience, while still maintaining the desired associations, and to what extent firms should formalize the cocreation process. Should all interested consumers be given an opportunity to cocreate, or should the firm work to identify segments of consumers who can yield better outcomes for the firm? By contrast, how should firms interact with the segment of passive, low-involvement consumers, and what are the consequences of cocreation by other consumers in this particular segment? Are certain brand types more malleable to cocreation efforts? What are the consequences (i.e., benefits and risks) of cocreated brand experiences on brand outcomes such as brand engagement?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For traditional brands that are incorporating digital platforms and channels into their strategy, there are interesting questions pertaining to the consumption experiences. For example, it is worth examining how brands effectively can effectively merge online and offline experiences. Theorizing the brand cocreation process from the firm perspective (how firms should manage and respond to cocreated brand experiences), the consumer perspective (how consumers cocreate and react to brand experience cocreation), and the society perspective (how cocreated brand experiences contribute to well-being and life satisfaction) could offer important insights.</p><a id="AN0141626360-31"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-31" title="Cocreating Brand Meaning">Cocreating Brand Meaning</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Companies not only cocreate brand experiences with their customers, but some are even offering consumers the opportunity to design brand advertisements ([118]). While research has begun examining the cocreation of brand meaning through outsourced advertising campaigns ([130]), extensions of this work should address various facets and consequences of outsourcing the design of brand communications to consumers ([139]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Even if firms wish to maintain full control over how they design and promote brand meaning, the rise of social media has led to weakened firm control over the brand meaning in the marketplace ([48]). Many-to-many communications on ubiquitous social media platforms have ushered in an era in which dynamic and real-time conversations are taking place among consumers on a massive scale ([15]; [126]). This has created a large volume of user-generated content that has made it easier for marketers to "listen" to consumers on social media platforms. Such listening has allowed marketers to derive unique insights into customer needs and wants, thus allowing them to replace costly traditional marketing research with low-cost, granular data available through social listening via user-generated content ([90]). At the same time, research has highlighted the amplification of positive and negative information in social media and its effects on brands ([49]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Understanding the implications of consumer-generated content on downstream outcomes, such as customer engagement, and the motivations for consumers to engage in generating word-of-mouth communications are two broad areas that have garnered research attention ([10]; [72]; [82]). Further research should build on these findings to determine the optimal balance of firm- versus user-generated content that can enhance consumers' perceptions of brand authenticity and increase their willingness to engage with a brand. All three theoretical perspectives can be leveraged to understand how consumers respond when brand meaning is cocreated by others. Finally, additional research is necessary on which online platforms or media can shape and significantly influence the meanings associated with particular brands, along with the best methods and metrics that can mine the data collected from these sources.</p><a id="AN0141626360-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-32" title="Creating New Brands in a Hyperconnected World">Creating New Brands in a Hyperconnected World</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Extant research on the determinants of new brands' performance has focused mainly on the consumer packaged goods industry and on marketing-mix and firm-strategic actions, such as discounting, feature/display, advertising, or distribution, with the breadth of the latter playing the greater role in the success of a new brand ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref138" title="6">6</a>]). Going beyond packaged goods categories, further research should focus on branding aspects in emergent categories of new goods and services. The breadth of new offerings, ranging from digital platform brands (e.g., TaskRabbit), to smart products (e.g., artificial intelligence toothbrushes such as Ara by Colibree), to new business models powered by new technologies (retail stores without a cashier such as Amazon Go), requires a fresh perspective on how to brand and manage complex products that interact in newer ways with their owners and with complementary products than more traditional products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">What are the key success factors of such new branded products? Owing to disintermediation (involving switching or elimination of traditional intermediaries in distribution channels) and reintermediation (addition of new forms of intermediaries in distribution channels), we expect traditional channels of distribution, and related factors examined in prior research, to be less important in the future ([43]). Rather, success will likely depend on the degree to which a brand can leverage hyperconnectivity among networks of people and devices. One manifestation of the easy access to consumers is the proliferation of direct-to-consumer brands such as Bonobos (men's clothing), Harry's (shaving), Glossier (cosmetics), and Warby Parker (eyewear). Yet direct-to-consumer brands do not only leverage hyperconnectivity by selling their products online; rather, they try to provide a distinct brand experience that sets them apart from their brick-and-mortar competitors by tapping into their network of consumers. [79] describes how Glossier aimed to make the customers an integral part of the buying experience. Glossier invites its customers to share product ideas and incentivizes them to share their Glossier brand experiences with their followers across social media channels such as Instagram. In this way, Glossier's network of customers are evangelists for the brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Three facets of hyperconnectivity are particularly relevant in the context of new brands: networked communications, network value creation, and data collection. In terms of networked communications, information and positive word of mouth about innovative new products can spread quickly via global social media and buying platforms, thus securing early adopters faster than ever before ([92]). Network value creation in a hyperconnected world will require smart products that connect with other products and provide value as a network or system; that is, they need to be "connectable" and connected with other brands ([93]). Brands have formed partnerships and alliances for decades to create add-on value; in the future, connecting with other brands will be at the very core of a brand's value creation and will precipitate the growth of a variety of related applications, such as augmented reality, blockchain, wearable technology, chatbots, and gamification ([115]). Finally, new brands are more likely to be perceived as innovative and valuable for the firm, consumers, and society if they collect data and make those data, or the features built on them, available to relevant stakeholders. For example, streaming services (e.g., Netflix, Hulu) leverage data gathered from consumers to recommend new shows to their audiences. Scholars should investigate ways in which data can be leveraged to be a central aspect of the value creation of a new brand. For instance, the brand Proven was created by applying artificial intelligence algorithms to vast quantities of data pertaining to ingredients, customer reviews, and scientific journals with the goal of identifying the most effective ingredients and creating a customized, data-driven line of skin care ([125]). In doing so, data can not only help improve firms' operations but also, if done responsibly, be of benefit to society.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If the ability to connect to other brands is key to a new brand's success, how should the brand be built? Product designs of the brands of the future will need to include sensors and receptors to leverage the device-to-device connectivity as discussed previously ([93]). Researchers need to determine conditions under which it is more effective for brands to establish their own ecosystem, as Apple has done, or plug into another one that allows them access to consumers and other brands. Moreover, brands of the future—whether smart home appliances, office equipment, cars, or industrial products—will not be fixed and static; they will be updated constantly, some even in real time, because their core design will also include software, not just hardware. As noted by [111], the digital revolution has moved the focus of brands "from atoms to bits" (i.e., from tangibles to intangibles), but the next wave of this revolution may involve incorporating smart technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and augmented and virtual reality into brands. Some of these technologies require deeper access to consumers' lives that may be perceived as intrusive. The extent to which consumers are willing make a trade-off between privacy concerns and the ability to have their products updated and maintained in real time is an interesting area of research inquiry.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, new brands will not be about ownership. The ownership model will likely be complemented by access- and occasion-based liquid consumption ([11]; [32]). The very notion of brand as a clearly defined entity that needs to create awareness and image among stakeholders to induce loyalty among them may even become obsolete and be replaced by a more transient model of value creation among interconnected devices that do not require much labeling and branding. If the importance of brands diminishes, what mechanism will replace brand equity to induce loyalty and trust in consumers? What factors will determine product choice in this new world? The new reality of branding described in this section calls for significant changes in the management of brands, which we examine next.</p><a id="AN0141626360-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-33" title="Rethinking Brand Management">Rethinking Brand Management</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this section, we discuss several key aspects of brand management that have been affected by hyperconnectivity.

Hyperconnectivity has fundamentally changed the way firms both position their brands and talk about them. Firms now must contend with three major changes. First, their competition has significantly broadened as connectivity has heightened consumer access to a large set of brands. Second, the internet and mobile devices offer a much broader space and more ways to communicate brand messages, making it more difficult to optimize message placement ([47]). Second, as we alluded to previously, firms' brand communications are supplemented and may even be dwarfed by those generated from outsiders (e.g., [126]). Thus, firms' brand messages may be not only blurred but also substantively modified by brand opinions generated by outsiders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of positioning, branding's pervasiveness across products, people, places, and ideas makes it more difficult for firms to clearly delineate their competitive space and to find a unique message that cuts across digital clutter. At the same time, just as consumers have access to numerous brands in the digital space, firms' potential consumer base is also increasing, which raises important questions about how firms should handle consumer heterogeneity and to what extent they should modify their message and offering to cater to such heterogeneity. Prior research has shown that differentiation is a double-edged sword, as it is associated with both higher customer profitability and lower acquisition and retention rates (e.g., [117]). More research is needed on strategies that can enable companies to wield this sword more effectively. This is of particular relevance in a hyperconnected context where consumers may find it impossible to engage deeply with the multitude of brands they encounter.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of the design and placement of brand messages, firms face an almost infinite number of advertising formats and channels. However, the effectiveness of these ads is being questioned, as firm communications in general and brand messages in particular are fighting information overload. Many firms are coping with the complex task of ad placement by relinquishing some control to algorithms that help with ad placement. This also has potential downsides, as ads may be placed alongside content that is deemed unsafe or controversial. Research on the consequences of brand advertising online and on mobile apps is emerging (e.g., [31]; [140]), but it is far from being able to provide clear prescriptive implications about the consequences of advertising for brand safety in a given digital space. How do consumers react if a brand inadvertently advertises on a webpage that is associated with content (such as hate speech) consumers may find offensive? What are some effective approaches to ensuring transparency throughout the advertising and media supply chain so that brands can evaluate and enforce safety of their advertised content? More research is needed to examine these questions in greater detail.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We highlighted the cocreation of brand meaning as one of the main consequences of hyperconnectivity. Firms are still searching for optimal ways to monitor, gather, analyze, and respond to brand information generated online. Many firms are investing in social media–listening control rooms or in engagement platforms that can help them better manage brands on an ongoing basis ([105]). From a capability standpoint, future research should offer stronger insight into how data scientists (responsible for gleaning insights from social media listening) can work with brand strategists within a firm to design optimal communications that leverages the insights from a continually evolving in online conversation spaces.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a brand management standpoint, firms need a consistent approach for identifying which consumers have more influential voices, what metrics best capture this influence, and what is the best response (in terms of message and medium) to shifting brand associations driven by outside stakeholders. This topic has recently received greater attention in scholarly research (e.g., [48]), and it is generating more interest in what firms can do to manage the conversation. As brand dialogues evolve in online conversation spaces, the effectiveness of firms' engagement in these dialogues will determine the extent to which they can control the brand message, at least in part. Scholarly insights into how firms can optimally design metrics dashboards are also necessary to ensure that firms can quickly disseminate relevant insights gleaned from big data. Finally, research needs to develop theory-rooted risk mitigating strategies that will allow brand managers to identify and correct deviations from the main brand message when these become prevalent in online conversations.</p><a id="AN0141626360-35"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-35" title="Blurred Control of Brand Crises">Blurred Control of Brand Crises</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The more porous ownership of brands carries with it the risk of crises arising from the actions of platform partners. Digital platform brands as well as traditional branded entities operating in a hyperconnected world must design and implement governance and response mechanisms that can minimize the loss of brand equity, when even trusted stakeholders such as firm partners and employees can take actions that hurt the brand. Branding researchers should therefore conceptualize and empirically test the effectiveness of governance mechanisms that safeguard against stakeholders' nefarious actions. Building on prior findings ([28]), research should evaluate the impact of various types of brand crises (precipitated by different stakeholder groups) on how consumers' attribute blame across platform partners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Hyperconnectivity does not stop at country borders ([30]). Consequently, novel metrics for tracking both short- and long-term impacts of brand crises on both a local and an international basis and across both financial (e.g., stock market reaction) and nonfinancial (e.g., brand trustworthiness, engagement) factors represents a fruitful area of research inquiry. Identifying the structures of brand teams that will facilitate optimal responses to brand crises will also be an important area for further research. Finally, understanding the implications of brand crises for employee engagement and satisfaction is also a key research issue.</p><a id="AN0141626360-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-36" title="Blurred Control of Brands as Identifiers of Intelligent, Interactive, and Networked Devices">Blurred Control of Brands as Identifiers of Intelligent, Interactive, and Networked Devices</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Radical new technologies have transformed brands from mere consumption objects to intelligent, interactive devices. As the next wave of the digital revolution is taking shape, the Internet of Things will allow branded devices to interact and exchange information with one another ([50]; [91]). Brands are mostly trademarked goods; in the context of hyperconnectivity, it is even more important to monitor how they are presented and identified across a broad range of devices, settings, and channels. Some of these settings could be outside brand managers' control, raising questions about the best way to manage the operations and promotion of brands that operate as part of networks of products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The rise of artificial reality (i.e., the creation of an interactive experience of a real-world environment through computer-generated displays) and virtual reality (a complete simulation of the environment also has a bearing on brands and their boundaries. Researchers need to understand how these technologies, which are able to seamlessly blend the real and virtual worlds, can create unique brand experiences for consumers before, during, and after purchase. Entertainment brands (e.g., video games such as <em>Pokémon Go</em>) and museums (e.g., Metropolitan Museum of Art) have combined aspects of real and virtual worlds to maximize the user experience across online and offline channels. The advent of artificial intelligence and its physical substrate (robots ranging from chatbots to full-fledged humanoids) raises questions of how to brand nontangible information and nonhuman, but humanlike, autonomous agents and how to use artificial intelligence as part of brand decision making and service delivery.</p><a id="AN0141626360-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-37" title="Measuring Brand Value">Measuring Brand Value</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Traditional brand valuation methods revolve around consumer-based brand equity, often measured with survey instruments such as the Brand Asset Valuator, the revenue premium that accrues to the brand, and brand discounted cash flows ([27]). These methods need to be updated to reflect the role of brands in a hyperconnected world. For example, as brands are increasingly deriving their appeal from cultural meanings, some pillars of brand equity (e.g., meaningfulness) may become more important than others (e.g., salience) ([39]). A revenue premium–based approach to assessing brand equity can still help assess short-term brand value but might not adequately capture the extent to which some brands may be better connected with their customers than with other stakeholders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, more exciting research challenges may be found in valuing brands that are born in and directly leverage hyperconnectivity—in particular, platform brands. How to value these brands, which typically have limited assets and sometimes little income, is both a managerially and academically important question. Practitioners' evaluation of platform brands varies significantly. For example, in 2018 Facebook had a brand value of $162.1 billion according to BrandZ versus only $45.2 billion according to Interbrand. For Netflix, the numbers were $20.8 billion and $8.1 billion, and for Spotify $15.7 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One approach to measuring the value of these types of brands would be to use the standard financial approach: brand value = current profit/(interest rate − profit growth rate). However, this standard approach may not be valid for networks, particularly if the network does not yet have any profits or if the profit growth rate exceeds the interest rate. Another approach suitable for subscription-based businesses is to calculate the customer lifetime value for each network member from his or her own discounted cash flows ([45]). This alternative is based on customer equity theory ([108]) but may not be particularly robust in a world in which people can easily cancel or change subscriptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Recent approaches to brand valuation in the context of networks take the user base into account, assuming that networks are more valuable if the social capital of its members is higher ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref164" title="4">4</a>]). [16], p. 248) defines social capital as "the sum of total resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual (or group) by the virtue of being enmeshed in a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition." Thus, the value of a brand that operates on a network increases as a function of current profit and size of the user base, but also with the social capital and social structure of its user base. However, consensus is lacking on the functional form of this relationship ([148]) and, in particular, on how to incorporate the intangible value that resides in the relationships between users into the value of the platform brand. Further research is necessary to understand whether social capital should be measured at the individual level and then aggregated to the network or directly at the network level to capture unobserved synergies in social capital. In addition, the role of the quality of social capital needs further examination. Bourdieu's "relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition" may be weak in networks such as LinkedIn, in which connections may be distant and nonconsequential. A more contemporary view on social capital seems essential to future research (e.g., [37]) and acknowledges branding to be of societal importance beyond the goals of the individual marketer ([102]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another important component of the valuation of brands on networks is the structure of the network. What kind of structure is more valuable? Is a tight-knit, cohesive structure (niche strategy) with many redundant ties more valuable ([26]), or a sparse network with few redundant ties (undifferentiated market saturation strategy), which facilitates wider diffusion of information ([19])? Finally, researchers focused on this type of valuation will need to determine the relative importance of the various inputs (current profit, user base, social capital, and network structure) and assess whether their weights may differ by industry and type of network. Measuring brand value of idea and person brands also poses unique challenges that marketers need to address.</p><a id="AN0141626360-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-38" title="Rethinking the Boundaries of Branding">Rethinking the Boundaries of Branding</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In recent years, branding research has broadened its scope to include brands from emerging countries ([83]), branding in a digital environment (e.g., [126]), and the branding of new entities such as place, organization, idea, and person (e.g., [41]; [119]).

For example, ideologies such as Puritanism, Calvinism, communism, and neoliberalism have also leveraged branding to gain adherents and to articulate their principles in a consistent manner. The American Dream, the New Deal, Reaganomics, and the Green New Deal are examples of branded initiatives originating from political entities and parties who make concerted efforts to obtain support, gain followers, build emotional relationships, and raise funds. We define idea brands as ideologies, initiatives, or other abstract, noncommercial notions that are identified by their stakeholders and the public at large using the same specific name. In other words, a set of ideas becomes branded when its stakeholders and the public at large use a specific label to refer to it, to affiliate with it, or to promote it. Idea brands span many domains—social, political, cause-related, and religious—and can evolve across domains; for example, cause-related ideas can morph into social causes as their popularity and supporter base increase ([38]). They are relatively ephemeral and highly dynamic entities, susceptible to hijacking, change, or even elimination. The dynamic nature of idea brands is further exacerbated by hyperconnectivity, as online social networks and platforms can sanction and spread them, reshape them, or oppose resistance to them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In light of these important differences, additional systematic research is required on how, when, and why certain idea brands are more successful than others. The hyperconnected era has increased the speed and scale at which ideas are disseminated, creating an urgent need for new models of how ideas diffuse and when and how ideas morph into social movements. Researchers could combine insights from research on diffusion and contagion theory ([23]) with elements from sociological theories related to social movements to elucidate the spread of different types of ideas (e.g., political, religious, social). An in-depth examination of the distinct ways that good ideas spread (e.g., humanitarian causes) relative to bad ideas (e.g., terrorism, racial intolerance) is also necessary. Furthermore, the consumer and society perspectives could come together to elucidate the differences between more and less authentic ideas to identify the characteristics of groups they appeal to and to evaluate their impact on the social actions of the individuals who adopt or oppose them.</p><a id="AN0141626360-40"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-40" title="Person Brands">Person Brands</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second type of branded entity that is gaining prominence in the context of hyperconnectivity is a person brand. Research has referred to a brand that is also a real person as a person brand ([41]), human brand ([131]), or celebrity brand ([63]). These types of brands have been used by everyone from a publicly visible and public-relations-conscious celebrity or politician to any person who uses a platform or engages in a form of self-promotion that is visible to his or her constituency. For example, [<a id="bib9up

The ability to create and promote a person brand online has led to the rise of influencers, a category of individuals who appear to have high potential as brand promoters and whose impact on brands and their meaning is the focus of recent scholarly research ([55]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In analyzing the distinct characteristics of person brands, [41] stress the challenges involved in unifying person and brand, as they are inextricably linked, mutually interdependent, but not identical. They argue that the key characteristics that define a person (mortality, hubris, unpredictability, and social embeddedness) can upset this mutually interdependent relationship and cause inconsistency and imbalance. In highlighting this aspect, [41] argue that this distinctive aspect of person brands (i.e., integrating across the person and the brand) creates unique risks for their management.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More research is needed to identify how these risks occur and can be mitigated. The downstream consequences (monetary and nonmonetary) of reputational losses associated with crises and scandals involving person brands are also worth examining, as hyperconnectivity can magnify the scale and scope of such losses, particularly in the short run. By contrast, the consequences of reputational losses may diminish over long-term windows from the volume of information and velocity with which information is continually updated. Building on the notion of interdependencies between person and brand, research could also investigate how this delicate balance shifts in the aftermath of a reputational crisis and whether a greater shift in focus on the shortcomings of the "person" actually improves overall perceptions of authenticity associated with the person brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As more people begin to adopt branding principles to promote themselves, understanding the societal implications of such actions is important. On the one hand, adoption of person-branding principles by noncelebrities could strengthen the ability of these individuals to become more attractive employees or more attractive dating partners. On the other hand, an excessive focus on self-promotion may also have a variety of negative consequences. For example, [81] highlight the unhealthy self-obsession and growth of narcissism as one potential consequence of leveraging social media to build one's brand. Understanding these effects of person branding on narcissism and its consequent implications for feelings of belongingness, happiness, and well-being are research issues that merit further investigation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, research should investigate the differences between brands built by average people and celebrity brands and identify the optimal approaches for reputation building across these two types of person brands. Another useful approach would be to distinguish between economic ("commercial") and noneconomic ("noncommercial") person brands. Commercial person brands such as celebrities, (micro) bloggers, and digital opinion leaders have their own following, and they derive income from sponsorships and sales recommendations and by branding their product lines (e.g., Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics). Much of the value of these person brands resides in their network, and future research should try to evaluate novel brand valuation approaches for this context.</p><a id="AN0141626360-41"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-41" title="Place Brands">Place Brands</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A place brand can be defined as "a network of associations in the consumers' mind based on the visual, verbal, and behavioral expression of a place, which is embodied through the aims, communication, values, and the general culture of the place's stakeholders and the overall place design" ([147], p. 5). Place branding is more than merely measuring the perceptions of the individuals who interact with that locale: place can be a sociological construction or an actively managed image-building and management strategy ([64]). Place brands develop as a result of complex interactions among residents, influenced by culture and history, and are thereby seen as dynamic, socially constructed, culturally dependent, and communally owned entities ([<a id="bib8up

These stakeholders could potentially have conflicting objectives, as exemplified by the opposing goals of tourists and residents in cities such as Amsterdam and Berlin ([20]). The differential role of multiple stakeholders in the development of place brands would be worth investigating, drawing on multiple disciplines such as political science, sociology, anthropology, cross-cultural psychology, urban planning, geography, and tourism research. Insights from the consumer and society perspectives could be integrated to conceptualize and measure place branding outcomes across various stakeholders, as well as to better understand intangible outcomes ([101]), such as life satisfaction of citizens and overall societal well-being. Spaces smaller than a city but commercially vital, such as Times Square, or trendy-shopping spaces such as Ginza (Tokyo) could also be researched in this day of the decline of the shopping mall. Factors such as the social density, social class perceptions and the implications for place brands should be examined ([96]), particularly in the context of a hyperconnected world.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Place branding research has so far focused on how place brands are created and consumed, and how place brand identity develops ([73]). Place attachment has examined how people forms associations with a place based on their childhood experiences ([87]). More recent research ([127]) draws on the large urban sociology literature to understand how branded spaces work through community, moral codes, and symbolic boundaries. Place brands share commonalities with other types of branded entities (e.g., their meanings are cocreated, as are those for idea and platform brands) but also differ in important ways: brand communications have to account for the diverse and potentially heightened social sensitivities that result from these conflicts.</p><a id="AN0141626360-42"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-42" title="Organizations as Brands">Organizations as Brands</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A fourth type of branded entity that is worth closer scrutiny in the era of hyperconnectivity is organizations.

Yet there is much more to organizations as brands. They have responsibilities to communities, to the environment, and, of course, to their own employees. The best manner in which organizations can create and deliver a purpose within society that aligns with their brand associations and mission is an area that still requires research. In addition, more nefarious organizations (e.g., terrorist organizations) that aim to overthrow the existing order through violence keenly understand the power of branding as well ([14]). Developing a deeper understanding of what drives brand perceptions for organizations that serve the common good and what could disrupt the branding efforts of infamous organizations might be a worthy research endeavor.</p><a id="AN0141626360-43"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626360-43" title="Metrics for Newer Branded Entities">Metrics for Newer Branded Entities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We previously discussed challenges and opportunities associated with measuring brand value in a hyperconnected environment. Newer branded entities such as noncommercial idea and person brands are uniquely difficult to value because generating cash flow may not be their purpose. Rather, their relevant metrics may be influence, power, votes, societal well-being (e.g., social justice, fighting climate change), or converts. Might consumer-based brand equity be a useful point of departure for valuing such brands? If so, what would be the relevant dimensions? Are traditional consumer-based brand equity measures such as those in the Brand Asset Valuator ([27]) relevant or sufficient? What would a properly-conceived-of consumer-based brand equity measure for noncommercial idea and person brands indicate about the actual strength of the brand? To answer these questions, researchers need to link this measure to the relevant outcome metrics for such brands. Another factor to consider when developing new methods to value idea and person brands is the greater risk associated with inconsistency and potential threats of scandals or crises ([41]).

On the one hand, we describe how hyperconnectivity has led to several new roles for brands. On the other hand, we reexamine how some traditional roles of brands (e.g., brands as signals of quality or as mental cues) have changed in a hyperconnected environment. We do so using firm, consumer, and society theoretical perspectives. We describe how hyperconnectivity contributes to several new roles in which brands are containers of socially constructed meaning, architects of value in networks, catalysts of communities, arbiters of controversy, and stewards of data privacy, among others. Many of these new roles can be the focus of research from multiple disciplinary perspectives, and we highlight a variety of research questions that can draw from different theoretical perspectives throughout the article. As brand boundaries are blurring, we also discuss the shift toward cocreated brand meanings and experiences enacted via digital platforms that facilitate such cocreation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given the complex nature of brands today, we hope researchers will engage in future boundary-breaking research on topics like those outlined here. As our review attests, one implication of hyperconnectivity for branding research lies in the fact that brands will need to be conceptualized more broadly within each of the theoretical perspectives in the extant brand literature. The consumer and firm perspectives should focus more on consumers and firms as part of networks, rather than on their roles as individual buyers or managers of brands. The society perspective should go beyond the role of brands as cultural symbols and examine them as agents of social change. Moreover, we propose that brands are more than symbols attached to products that are owned by individual firms. They can be ideas, people, and places.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There is also an opportunity to examine topics that cut across these theoretical perspectives. For example, the firm perspective will need to embrace societal questions as organizations or corporate brands are asked to address broader issues including social responsibility, sustainability, and human-resource practices that go beyond profit maximization. Brands need to fulfill a broader mission and purpose. The consumer perspective will also have to be more rooted in the society perspective as consumers form networks that are becoming distinct and occasionally vociferous entities that can shape both managerial practice and societal trends. The impact of network on brands, like that of communities, requires additional sociological, psychological, and cultural insight.

This research investigates salespeople's use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers' attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople's influence tactics in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data, and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers' attention and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at a disadvantage in closing the contract award.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: business to business; buyer attention; e-communication; linguistic; machine learning; negotiation; selling; text analysis</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Advances in digital technologies motivate firms to adopt technology-mediated channels for business interactions. In particular, business e-communications account for more than 125 billion daily messages, or 86 million messages per second ([53]). According to industry reports, 77% of customers prefer e-communications over other formats, and data indicate robust returns of $40.56 for every dollar companies invest in e-communications ([40]). For business-to-business (B2B) selling ([54]), these trends also are manifest in a 75% increase in e-negotiations ([<a id="bib9up

However, they also provide a unique, relatively unobtrusive, unfettered, and automatic access to the selling process by creating a permanent record of the selling process as it unfolds, without requiring an intervention (e.g., surveys and video/audio recordings can suffer from a reporting and obtrusive bias). Emergent academic research that utilizes process data from digital technologies show promise of new insights. For instance, researchers analyzed more than 1 million email exchanges among members of a professional services organization over a six-month period to show that response times are highly predictive of social and professional ties ([67]). Evidence from other studies of buyer–seller interactions shows that the process underlying influence mechanisms is more complex and nuanced than is revealed by self-reports or static studies ([34]; [51]). Thus, we aim to examine the effectiveness of salespeople's dynamic influence tactics (as textual cues) for winning sales contracts during the e-negotiation phase of the B2B selling process when email is the dominant mode of communication.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Specifically, using actual emails exchanged between buyers and salespeople, we (<a id="bib1up

We employ a unique data set of longitudinal email communications, sourced from a B2B heavy equipment manufacturing firm (Study 1). The communications involve a lead seller and the principal buyer, and our unfettered access to these naturalistic data, untainted by the seller's perceptions, provides real-life accounts of buyer–seller negotiations ([13]). To rule out alternative explanations, we supplement the email data with in-depth interviews, survey data (e.g., demographics, attitudes) and a sales manager survey that provides performance and profitability data. Finally, we conduct an experimental study (Study 2) to examine the mediation effect of buyer attention in a controlled setting and test the influence of the concurrent use of internalization (recommendation) and compliance (promise) tactics on the sales contract award.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, we offer three main contributions. First, we identify sales influence tactics from textual cues in salesperson's e-communications and establish their validity. In so doing, we develop a five-step roadmap for developing and validating theoretical constructs from textual cues for broader use in future research. The five-step design uses grounded analysis to develop word dictionaries and contextualizes them to provide authentic representations of the target constructs. In turn, these bottom-up word dictionaries serve to "seed" a machine-learning (ML) algorithm that broadens their scope and expands their content to a reasonably large corpus of textual cues to ensure generalizability. Empirically, we show how "seed" dictionaries that are based on grounded work can offer a prediction accuracy of 63% that rises to 85% when they are combined with patterns recognized by ML procedures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we identify a key mediator of salesperson influence effects—buyer attention, defined as the degree to which a buyer displays behavioral responses to a salesperson's e-communications ([20]; [36]; [42]; [43]; [51]). We find that buyer attention is a leading indicator ([21]) of sales activity that predicts sales outcomes. In particular, our results show that a one-standard-deviation increase in buyer attention increases the likelihood of contract award seven-fold, resulting in an additional $37 million in revenue. Thus, while previous research has shown that sales influence tactics are effective in increasing performance, our theory of buyer attention explains both <em>why</em> salesperson influence tactics work to yield sales outcomes and when they do not, thereby advancing research into the mechanisms of the sales negotiation process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we show that no individual influence tactic is sufficient to hold buyers' attention or win the contract award. Effective use of influence tactics requires the concurrent use of complementary tactics that prompt either internalization (internal analyzing) or compliance (risk shifting), but not both. Our results show that the concurrent use of assertiveness and promise tactics to evoke compliance lifts buyer attention by 14%, whereas concurrent use of information sharing and recommendation tactics to evoke internalization yields a 15% increase in buyer attention. In contrast, concurrent use of internalization and compliance tactics—referred to as competitive tactics—diminishes buyer attention by as much as 30%. This asymmetry in the concurrent use of sales influence tactics, such that gains from complementary tactics are only half as much as the losses from competitive tactics, is indicative of prospect theory assertions. Thus, our study advances the sales negotiations literature by uncovering the asymmetric effect of sales influence tactics and providing practical guidelines for sales managers and salespeople about what sales tactics to deploy in combination and which combinations to avoid for sales effectiveness. Next, we discuss pertinent literature and motivate our key hypothesis.</p><a id="AN0141626358-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-2" title="Theory and Hypotheses">Theory and Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figures&nbsp;1 and 2 display the research context and the proposed conceptual model of e-communications, which includes (<a id="bib1up

According to the attention-based view of the firm, attention facilitates both coping with and adapting to contextual stimuli ([42]). An entity with limited information-processing capacity copes with overwhelming stimuli by prioritizing and focusing on selective stimuli ([60]). An entity also might adapt to incoming stimuli by directing attention to stimuli that are more likely to facilitate goal achievement while dismissing stimuli with less goal instrumentality ([42]). If stimuli garner an entity's attention, this indicates their relative importance and relevance ([43]).

As [14] suggest, attention functions like a gatekeeper for sorting, managing, and evaluating stimuli according to their fit with self-meaning.

[65] concurs that buyer attention is critical because if the customer is not paying attention to what the seller is focused on, all efforts are wasted.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regarding its motivational potential, [29] show that attention can be a source of "preference formation," such that after directing their attention, people exhibit a preference for the focus of that attention, which they call the "mere attention effect." Such selective attention entails an encoding process that stores the selected stimuli according to preferred network connections, relative to stimuli that are triaged. This encoding motivates preferences in subsequent action. In other words, "highly attentive buyers...purchase more products, more often, [and] for longer period of time" ([<a id="bib6up

Relative to F2F communication, e-communications permit greater accessibility, such that a salesperson can compose messages with the desired level of richness at any time and reach out to a buyer with follow-up targeted communications (cf. Table 1). In turn, this medium's accessibility promotes message crowding wherein salespeople try to grab buyers' attention quickly, engage them in compelling dialogue, and challenge their assumptions about needs and solutions ([16]). However, such continuous e-communications increase the burden on the buyer's cognitive capacity. Furthermore, although the transparency feature of e-communications is attractive, it also adds to the cognitive burden because it prompts analyses of message content and comparisons with previous messages or other sources. When buyers experience greater cognitive load, buyer attention should offer a particularly reliable and sensitive indicator of message priority during B2B negotiations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The textual cues of e-communications reveal the degree of buyer attention. Positively valenced words indicate heightened interest ([28]). Use of more active than passive text also indicates the activation of behavioral attention ([57]). Likewise, textual cues of time urgency reveal increased buyer attention, such as when a buyer asks the salesperson to respond "ASAP" ([12]). [<a id="bib7up

Such signals of increased buyer attention show that the salesperson's messages have been granted relatively higher priority, and thus we expect them to be associated with increased probability of contract award.

In a buyer-dominated sales process, inspirational appeals as well as their opposites (e.g., threats) are less relevant ([36]; [51]). Inspirational appeals presume that emotions sway buyers' decisions, but for B2B sales negotiations, with open bid processes and managerial or regulatory oversight, emotional appeals are relatively rare. The uses of threats or legalistic pleas presume that a contract already exists. Ingratiation might build relational bonds in F2F communications, but its use in professional email exchanges is less common, because such explicit and transparent exchanges generally make ingratiation attempts inappropriate. Accordingly, we do not include ingratiation appeals in our hypotheses, but to reflect prior research, we include them in the empirical analysis as a statistical control ([<a id="bib1up

First, we use a "slice"—a continuous tract of time (e.g., ten days) that clusters e-communications—as the unit of conceptual and empirical analysis. It offers an alternative to a single salesperson–buyer turn or an entire string of communications as the unit of analysis. The former tends to be overly sensitive and prone to noisy input due to truncated or out-of-turn communications (e.g., multiple salesperson emails with no buyer response; [<a id="bib9up

Desired changes in the buyer's attention provide a key mechanism by which influence tactics effectively achieve outcomes. Third, we advance prior conceptualizations in marketing that have adapted and refined the work of [31], specifically the compliance and internalization constructs, which initially served as foundations to understand social influence in international relations. Among the first efforts, [64], p. 76) drew on Kelman's work to categorize existing influence tactics developed by [20] using "processes of social influence and attitude and behavior change." [64], p. 76) conceptualized that internalization is evoked by task-oriented influence tactics, including information sharing and recommendation, because they "seek to persuade a target of the inherent merit of the proposed decision." Furthermore, they stated that compliance is prompted by non-task-oriented influence tactics, such as requests or promises, which "seek to obtain conformance without attempting to persuade the target of the appropriateness of the decision." Leveraging this linkage between Kelman's social influence theory and influence tactics in marketing, [36] examined the relevance of influence tactics for salespeople and predicted the correspondence between Kelman's social influence mechanisms and individual influence tactics. They similarly predict that information sharing and recommendation tactics evoke intrinsic processes, whereas promises and threats indicate an instrumental mechanism. Their empirical findings indicate that individual influence tactics affect the buyer's manifest influence consistent with this categorization, such that when an intrinsic process is activated, the effects are larger and significant. [26], [51], and [37] adopt this categorical correspondence between Kelman's social influence mechanisms and influence tactics. We similarly draw on the conceptual categories of internalization and compliance but adapt their conceptualizations to e-communications.</p><a id="AN0141626358-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-5" title="Information sharing and recommendation tactics">Information sharing and recommendation tactics</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Both information sharing, defined as communicating and exchanging knowledge about solutions/services/products, and recommendation, defined as the explicit suggestion in favor of a particular solution/service/product, are likely to evoke internalization ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref61" title="8">8</a>]; [31]; [36]). In e-communications, internalization implies internal analyzing, such that a buyer is motivated to assess the stimuli contained in the salesperson's message to evaluate the benefits and costs of an action, activity, or choice. Information sharing prompts the buyer to evaluate the substantive content of the message and analyze the potential to increase or decrease the likely benefits and costs of an offer. In the case of recommendation, provision of a suggested course of action with decisional responsibility on the buyer also prompts the buyer to evaluate the credibility of the message and its implications in the context of the buyer's use situation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Information sharing and recommendation tactics trigger an internal-analyzing process in complementary ways. Unlike F2F exchanges, e-communications enable the salesperson to craft messages carefully and thereby include attachments such as drawings, industry reports, or white papers that offer novel information about unique product or service specifications that can overcome objections and meet buyers' needs ([45]). The richness of novel information, combined with buyer vigilance to assess its relevance for goal pursuit, prompts analysis by the buyer. When the incoming information is evaluated to be favorable in advancing buyers' goals, it is likely to be internalized and prompt more positive dispositions toward the object of the information ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref65" title="8">8</a>]). [36] show that, relative to sales situations characterized by the buyer's self-orientation or interaction orientation (i.e., social welfare), those that feature task orientations (such that they are goal oriented) enable more significant, positive effects of the salesperson's information sharing on the buyer's manifest (perceived) influence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In F2F exchanges, salespeople also issue recommendations that leverage social bonds or interpersonal trust with the buyer. However, the flatness and transparency of e-communications may hinder a salesperson's attempts to engage in explicit social bonding or trust building ([10]). Buyers also might be more vigilant, to protect against self-serving claims by salespeople. These features activate the buyer's careful analysis of recommendation claims; if the analysis suggests positive implications for achieving the buyer's goal, the recommendations shift the buyer's attention toward their object. Prior research has shown that salespeople's recommendation tactic is effective when it is successful in reframing status quo solutions as suboptimal or problematic, which can be improved by the salesperson's recommended course of action ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref68" title="8">8</a>]; [27]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also posit that the concurrent use of information sharing and recommendations will interact to positively affect buyer attention, due to the reinforcing effects of these compatible processing motivations, especially when the buyer's cognitive resources are stretched. Both information sharing and recommendation evoke an internalization mechanism that favors internal analyses of input stimuli, in complementary ways. With their concurrent use, they should enhance attention effects, because the message content is reinforced by consistency and coherence ([50]). Similarly, the concurrent use of search and display advertising online yields better results, because search advertising evokes a deliberate process to reveal consumer preferences, and display advertising acts like a recommendation agent that directs customers to a preferred site. We posit that textual cues of information sharing and recommendation promote cognitive consistency and coherence, because the former enables the buyer to process new knowledge and realize the disadvantages of current solutions, whereas the latter provides suggestions for resolving the problem ([27]).

In B2B e-communications, risk shifting is evoked by salesperson messages that provide affordances for buyers to mitigate decision risk, simplify information processing, and/or reduce uncertainty ([41]). Salesperson messages that effectively mitigate buyers' decision risk and cognitive burden are likely to garner increased attention due to their relevance in situations in which time is at a premium, informational uncertainty is high, and cognitive resources are stretched. Such risk shifting is not necessarily suboptimal; it reflects a reasoned choice. For example, the buyer's risk can be shifted and informational uncertainty reduced if the buyer complies with a course of action suggested by the textual cues in the salesperson's messages.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Promises and assertiveness both evoke risk shifting, but in complementary ways. When a salesperson makes a promise, it mitigates buyer risk and uncertainty by guaranteeing some specific outcome, benefit, or payoff. In e-communications, salespeople issue promises that increase clarity and help buyers visualize the expected payoffs. In this sense, an explicit promise of a desired outcome, conditional on a favorable decision, should strongly reduce the cognitive burden by enabling the buyer to forgo a systematic risk analysis (benefits/costs) in favor of a promised outcome for which the seller bears the risk. Likewise, when a salesperson uses an assertiveness tactic to demonstrate superior knowledge and expertise in offering certain solutions, services, and products, this also mitigates buyer risk ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref75" title="4">4</a>]). E-communications enable salespeople to assert expertise and superior knowledge by sharing scientific evidence and cases tailored to attractive solution options. Because the explicit and permanent nature of e-communications permits independent verification and validation of a salesperson's knowledge claims by multiple members of the buyer organization, knowledge claims that are credible affirm the salesperson's assertiveness of expertise. [23] shows that the use of assertiveness during sales processes improves outcomes, and [46] demonstrate that a directed request tactic enhances the salesperson's manifest influence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Here again, we predict a positive, interactive effect of salespeople's concurrent use of promise and assertiveness in e-communications on buyer attention, beyond the distinct effect of each tactic. Both shift decision risk and reduce information uncertainty; this complementary impact should reinforce the consistency and coherence of salesperson messaging without creating the downside of repetitive or belabored messages associated with a singular influence tactic. That is, by making promises, the salesperson indicates a willingness to take on the risk on behalf of the buyer, and assertiveness mitigates the buyer's informational uncertainty by redirecting attention to tailored solutions designed according to the salesperson's expert knowledge. Research offers similar evidence that a salesperson, acting as an expert consultant, can reduce risk perceptions with a consultative selling approach ([32]; [52]).

Second, guided by these lists of sales e-negotiations and identifiers, an information technology manager extracted the emails from the firm's servers. Third, we checked the extracted emails for completeness with regard to identifiers such as date and time stamps, receiver's/sender's name, and email subject. We also determined the incidence of email exchanges between the lead salesperson and lead buyer (&gt;90%) versus other buying team members (e.g., project manager, legal). We retained only those sales e-negotiations that entailed at least 20 emails and thus excluded six sales e-negotiations. Further analysis revealed that these six sales e-negotiations were unusual, lower-valued negotiations that resulted from F2F interactions. Finally, we recorded information specific to the sales e-negotiations, such as the price and negotiation outcome. In total, we sampled communications for 47 distinct sales e-negotiations.</p><a id="AN0141626358-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-11" title="Unit of analysis">Unit of analysis</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The unit of analysis is a slice, defined as a specific continuous tract of time that clusters e-communications, guided by conceptual and empirical considerations. As noted previously, using a single turn as a unit of analysis is overly sensitive and prone to noisy input. E-negotiations often contain truncated or out-of-turn patterns of communications that occur for several reasons, including buyers and sellers working in different time zones, having different schedules, returning to a previous message to clarify comments, or due to power asymmetry in favor of the buyer. Using the entire string of communications as a single chunk is similarly problematic because it collapses time and obscures influence dynamics, especially for contract negotiations that can run into months of back-and-forth communications. The use of "slice of time," involving grouping of communications over a narrow band of time provides an intermediate but effective approach to examine influence dynamics. [62] used a similar approach in which they grouped 100 consecutive sentences as an analysis unit while studying high-stakes negotiations. For our analysis, we considered three alternative slices—7 days, 10 days, and 14 days—in which we grouped emails based on their similarity of subject line text using cosine distance, a commonly used similarity measure in text analysis.

To examine measure validity, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with two measures for each influence tactic (linguistic cues for each influence tactic were randomly divided into two groups) and three dimensions of buyer attention. Textual cues extracted by the ML methods suffer from lack of multivariate normality conditions. We checked for distributional properties of extracted measures and noted that an extraction method robust to high kurtosis is needed. Thus, we used robust CFA analysis methods such as maximum likelihood robust and maximum likelihood parameter estimates with Satorra–Bentler correction ([35]). Using these robust procedures, we found an acceptable Satorra–Bentler chi-square statistic for the hypothesized measurement model (34.08, d.f. = 37, <em>p</em> &gt;.1). Furthermore, fit indices confirmed the goodness-of-fit of the measurement model (normed fit index =.92, root mean square error of approximation =.001). Each influence tactic measure and buyer attention construct evidenced significant factor loadings, convergent validity (average variance extracted [AVE] &gt;.50), and discriminant validity (AVE &gt; maximum shared variance [MSV]) (Table 4, Panel A).

We estimate the following equations ([24]):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mtable

buyer attention and influence tactics on the sales contract award, we specify a probit model that accounts for the heterogeneity in the impact of buyer attention as a function of salesperson and contract-specific time invariant variables. The estimated model includes unidirectional causal effects because buyer attention precedes the sales contract award. We expect the disturbance terms across equations to be uncorrelated; we tested this by estimating the equations simultaneously allowing for correlated errors, but we failed to find significance (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1df</sub> = 1.93; <em>p</em> &gt;.1).

As [55] explain, when one or more explanatory variables are caused simultaneously and reciprocally with the specified dependent variable, the resultant endogeneity occurs due to simultaneity. To address this endogeneity due to simultaneity, we follow Rutz and Watson's review of appropriate approaches and guidelines for an instrumental variable approach. Alternative approaches, such as latent instrument variables and Gaussian copula, do not fit our empirical setting. To produce valid and strong instruments, we use predicted scores from regressions of the current value of a contemporaneous variable on its past values, lagged one period, as well as the dependent variable, lagged one period ([55]). These instruments satisfy the exclusion criteria; they correlate with the current values of the predictor variables that they precede and are not influenced by contemporaneous unobservable variables. To establish validity of the instruments, we conduct the Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions where the instruments are uncorrelated with the residuals and yield a nonsignificant statistic (.28 χ<sup>2</sup><sub>4df</sub> = 7.78, <em>p</em> &lt;.1), indicating the validity of the instruments ([22]). To establish strength of the instruments, we regress the endogenous variable on all exogenous variables and then add instruments in the second step to perform an incremental F-test; a value higher than 10 indicates strong instruments. The obtained F-statistics demonstrate that the instruments are strong, with incremental F-statistics of 64.85 (information sharing), 76.91 (recommendation), 60.75 (promise), 60.83 (assertiveness), and 67.14 (ingratiation) (all <em>p</em> &lt;.001; d.f. = 16, 18). Since we have multiple endogenous regressors, we also conducted the Sanderson–Windmeijer weak instrument F-test for assessing the strength of the instruments. The first-stage F-statistics are also highly significant and exceed the threshold of 10 ([59]), supporting the strength of the instruments.</p><a id="AN0141626358-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-22" title="Impact of Influence Tactics and Buyer Attention on Sales Contracts">Impact of Influence Tactics and Buyer Attention on Sales Contracts</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0141626358-23"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-23" title="Model fit">Model fit</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We compared the hypothesized model with a model with only control variables.

However, the conditional <em>indirect</em> effect of information sharing on the contract award is significant and negative when recommendation increases from −2 SD (−4.44, <em>p</em> &lt;.001, 95% CI = [−5.80, −3.07]) to −.1 SD (−.79, <em>p</em> &lt;.001, 95% CI = [−1.02, −.56]).

Specifically, we aim to test the interactive effect of concurrent use of recommendation (internal analyzing) and promise (risk shifting) tactics on the likelihood of sales contract award. We define these inconsistent influence tactics as a "competitive" combination of tactics from theoretically incompatible categories and hypothesize that this combination diminishes buyer attention and lowers purchase likelihood.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Support for this finding is forthcoming from the generalizable findings of cognitive inconsistencies research (mixed signals). In particular, promises and recommendations present disparate cues for buyers. Promises nudge buyers to shift decision risk with an instrumental cognition focused on expected payoffs from the promised outcome that the seller guarantees. By contrast, textual cues signaling recommendations prompt systematic analyses, intrinsically focused on expected benefits and costs of alternative options, such that the buyer bears the decisional risk. When used concurrently, promise and recommendation cues send mixed signals. [18], pp. 221–22) report that mixed signals tend to heighten ambiguity and abandonment of effortful analyses. Similarly, [39] find that divergent signals result in ambivalence. Consistent with these studies, we anticipate that a competitive use of influence tactics dilutes their effect on buyer attention and, in turn, lowers purchase likelihood. The experimental study is designed to provide explanatory insights, not definitive evidence of causal mechanisms. It is prudent to examine the boundary condition uncovered in Study 1 for its explanatory power in a controlled setting before delving into its causal mechanisms.

To mitigate measurement error bias, testing H<sub>4b</sub> requires that measured variables of the buyer attention construct be used in hypothesis testing as latent, not observed, variables. Accounting for measurement error is also necessary to obtain unbiased estimates for the indirect effect ([49]). A simultaneous equations model with latent variables and robust estimation to account for nonnormal distribution of dependent variables provides a methodological approach that meets the preceding requirements.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We implement the aforementioned approach by using maximum likelihood robust estimator in Mplus with 10,000 bootstrap iterations to estimate the asymmetric CIs of the conditional indirect effect and test its statistical significance. We also included satisfaction as a control variable along with other potential confounders (e.g., age, education, gender). Overall, our hypothesized model for full mediation by buyer attention fits the experimental data reasonably well (χ<sup>2</sup> = 71.55, d.f. = 40, <em>p</em> &lt;.001, comparative fit index/Tucker–Lewis index =.95/.94, root mean square error of approximation =.088, P-close = [.05,.12], and standardized root mean square residual =.04). The good fit of the fully mediated model to the experimental data confirms our hypothesis that buyer attention plays a central role in carrying the influence of salesperson's influence tactics. Moreover, the pattern of estimated conditional indirect effect of recommendation and promise tactics on buyer attention is also consistent with H<sub>4b</sub>. The impact of recommendation tactic is significant and positive at −1 SD of promise tactic (2.63, <em>p</em> &lt;.001, 95% CI = [1.73, 3.53]), but this conditional indirect effect becomes negative when the use of promise tactic is at +1 SD (−.46, <em>p</em> &lt;.01, 95% CI = [−.79, −.12]). The corresponding indirect effect of recommendation with bias-corrected bootstrap 95% CIs are 2.74 [1.78, 3.72], <em>p</em> &lt;.01) at −1 SD of promise, and −.47 [−.87, −.11], <em>p</em> &lt;.05) at +1 SD of promise. The robust and significant indirect effect of influence tactics on contract award likelihood is an indication of the strength and significance of the mediation effect of buyer attention.

Furthermore, by using validated textual cues from Study 1 to manipulate salespeople's use of influence tactics, Study 2 provides a direct test of the influence tactics library developed in Study 1.

Advances in this area have been hampered by the demands of conducting research on influence tactics deployed as e-communications. Among them are unfettered access to the entirety of e-communications between salespeople and buyers, measuring and modeling sales influence tactics by using unstructured text data, and theorizing an influence process that provides the mediating mechanism linking the salesperson's influence tactics and the buyer's contract award decision. To navigate these challenges, and advance insights into the effectiveness of sales influence tactics in B2B e-communications, we conduct two studies and establish four main contributions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, we provide a roadmap for sales research that uses unstructured data obtained from salesperson–buyer interactions to test theoretical models of sales mechanisms. Study 1 shows how buyer and seller emails may be used as data to capture influence tactics and their effects. Second, we establish the theoretical and managerial significance of buyer attention as a key mediator in the relationship between salesperson's use of influence tactics and the sales contract award. Previous studies in marketing have studied direct effects of influence tactics on sales outcomes but rarely examined the mechanism that underlies these effects. Third, we advance a theory of influence tactics in B2B e-negotiations by conceptualizing and demonstrating that influence tactics, as textual cues, are invariably more effective in winning contracts when they are used in specific combination than when they are used individually. Prior research has overlooked the gains from concurrent use of different influence tactics in B2B negotiations. Fourth, we demonstrate that the concurrent use of influence tactics is effective in securing contract awards <em>only</em> when the tactics are complementary in prompting internalization (internal analyzing) <em>or</em> compliance (risk shifting). Specifically, we show that the concurrent use of competitive influence tactics degrades buyer attention and diminishes the likelihood of contract award. Previous research has missed that salespeople's use of some influence tactics has the counterintuitive effect of escalating loss probability of the contract award. We discuss these contributions next, followed by implications for managers and future research.</p><a id="AN0141626358-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-33" title="Influence Tactics as Textual Cues in Sales E-Negotiations">Influence Tactics as Textual Cues in Sales E-Negotiations</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Constructs are the building blocks that bridge our theories of a phenomenon with empirical analysis of its manifestation.

As a first step, this research relied on the linguistic content of buyers' emails to extract their attentional mindset. While composed emails are likely to be incomplete and constrained representation of buyer attention, they have the advantage of being accurate (e.g., the buyer's own words) and time sensitive (e.g., stamped by time of sending the email). The results from Studies 1 and 2 consistently show that buyer attention fully mediates the effect of salespeople's use of influence tactics on the likelihood of sales contract award. Our insight is that the waxing and waning of buyer attention in B2B sales negotiation, visible in the signals of buyers' message content and urgency, among others, provide an early indication of sales effectiveness that is relatively robust and remarkably diagnostic of the likelihood of sales contract award. The confirming evidence of buyer attention's mediating role in the experimental study, in which alternative explanations are more tightly controlled, lends credence to our conceptual contribution that buyer attention offers a mechanism for understanding <em>how</em> influence tactics work.

Compliance involves risk shifting, which nudges the buyer to shift decisional risk to the seller by leaning toward the guaranteed outcome, is stimulated the use of textual cues that involve being assertive and making promises.

This is surprising because, in practice, salespeople flexibly use multiple influence tactics by instinct. Our study fills this void and advances the field by demonstrating that gaining B2B buyer attention is more effective when different (rather than same) influence tactics are used concurrently as long as the influence tactics are complementary in prompting either internalization or risk shifting.</p><a id="AN0141626358-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-36" title="The Disadvantage of Concurrent Use of Competing Influence Tactics as Textual Cues">The Disadvantage of Concurrent Use of Competing Influence Tactics as Textual Cues</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 2 confirms the theoretical expectation that when salespeople concurrently use competing influence tactics, this results in diminished buyer attention and lower contract closing success. Few, if any, studies have examined such competing combinations. For instance, parallel work in product management has examined the effect of salespeople's efforts to combine compliance-generating (e.g., "rationality") and compliance-impeding ("assertiveness") tactics on product manager compliance ([30]). This study advances Joshi's intuition about the disadvantage of stimulating inconsistent cognitions by explicitly testing the effect of using recommendation and promise tactics concurrently within a controlled experimental study. The results reveal that the disadvantage of competing influence tactics is substantial. Specifically, Study 1 data show that concurrent use of the promise tactic with low levels of recommendation is equivalent to a 92% probability of contract award; however, this probability reduces to less than 50% when the salesperson uses both promise and recommendation, all else being equal. Such concurrent use of competing influence tactics can make the difference between winning or losing contracts.</p><a id="AN0141626358-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-37" title="Future Research Directions">Future Research Directions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several study limitations provide avenues for future research. First, we investigate negotiations that feature only a single seller over a two-year time period. Future research could add to this body of work on influence tactics by testing their effect across different stages (e.g., early, late) of the negotiation, advancing theory for competitive effects of influence tactics, and expanding the scope of the studied B2B e-negotiations in other industry contexts. Second, we develop a typology of different affordances that are unique to e-communications and draw on these attributes to develop a theory of influence tactics in B2B e-negotiations. Researchers may use the proposed typology to ground future studies of e-communications and enrich its features. Third, we propose a five-step roadmap for developing and validating theoretical constructs from textual cues; tools for analyzing unstructured text data continue to improve, promising the ability to account for paratextual cues such as amplifiers (e.g., different colored text) or accentuators (e.g., exclamation marks). We invite future contributions that enhance and enrich this roadmap to bolster the field's building blocks for theory development. Fourth, we theorize and obtain empirical support for buyer attention as a mediating mechanism in B2B e-negotiations using naturalistic data to extract theoretical constructs for testing hypotheses and an experimental design to study underlying mechanism. Finally, with growing usage of mobile as a way to communicate, future research should consider the effect of device type on sales e-negotiations ([38]).</p><a id="AN0141626358-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-38" title="Implications for Salespeople and Sales Managers">Implications for Salespeople and Sales Managers</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our results hold several important implications for salespeople and those who manage them. First, our study offers a recommendation for the sales process training. A worldwide survey of 513 firms ([15]) indicates that sales training focused on the sales process is crucial for salespeople in enhancing win rates. Our study recommends that sales organizations incorporate into their training programs guidelines for building buyer attention during sales e-negotiations. During our salesperson interviews, we learned that seasoned salespeople with proven sales performance in traditional interfaces (e.g. F2F, phone) often struggle to assess the buyer's mindset in e-communications. Our findings show that this training gap is important to fill because salespeople who are successful in increasing buyers' attention by a factor of 1 SD increase the likelihood of contract award seven-fold to yield an additional $37 million in revenue. In motivating salespeople, we recommend that sales managers specify buyer attention as a key process metric. By measuring buyer attention for each e-negotiation on an ongoing basis, the manager can establish a new performance indicator and identify skill gaps that require more directed coaching.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, salespeople need to gain a nuanced understanding of how to leverage influence tactics during e-negotiations. Our study suggests that existing "best practices" in sales influence tactics are unhelpful when they attempt to simplify the sales influence process by focusing on direct effects of individual tactics such as "tactic X will produce result Y" or "tactic X is better than Z to produce result Y." The salespeople we interviewed attested to the ineffectiveness of sales influence practices in e-negotiations that work in F2F interactions. By isolating the benefits of the concurrent use of complementary influence tactics, we suggest a different path to winning contracts: sales managers should coach salespeople to deploy different combinations of complementary sales tactics and avoid any combination of competitive sales tactics. We demonstrate that concurrent deployment of complementary sales tactics within each e-negotiation slice yields significant gains in buyer attention and a reliable pathway to the contract award. For instance, the concurrent use of assertiveness and promise tactics to evoke compliance during e-negotiations boosts buyer attention by 14% on average. Likewise, the concurrent use of information sharing and recommendation tactics to evoke internalization during e-negotiations tactics results in 15% increase in buyer attention. In contrast, competitive combinations that are concurrently deployed invite losses in buyer attention (30% on average) and significantly diminish the likelihood of contract award.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, the validated textual cue dictionaries from this study can help design training and assessment methods to enhance selling effectiveness. Firms may have access to much larger data sets than the one used for this research. The proposed measurement approach, which incorporates ML algorithms, is developed with this industry trend in mind and is well-suited for big data. Managers can adopt our approach and library of validated words and phrases according to their own sales context. This aligns with recent trends in the sales field, in which ML is increasingly used for predictive content recommendation (e.g., what a salesperson should say in the email) as well as script optimization (e.g., how to say it) ([<a id="bib3up

We also show that "seed" dictionaries that are based on grounded work can offer a prediction accuracy of 63%. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy improves substantially to 85% when "seed" dictionaries are combined with patterns recognized by ML. According to [68], firms most poised to benefit from ML in sales are those that have (<a id="bib1up

Managers in such firms can readily adopt our approach and conduct context-specific refinements to enhance sales effectiveness. Participation of professional sales staff in this process can also aid in promoting ownership and building commitment. Looking ahead, sophisticated and contextualized dictionaries of textual cues for successful e-selling can be used as tools for building and sustaining the competitive advantage of the sales organization.</p><a id="AN0141626358-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0141626358-39" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, jm.18.0537-File003 - Business-to-Business E-Negotiations and Influence Tactics</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, jm.18.0537-File003 for Business-to-Business E-Negotiations and Influence Tactics by Sunil K.

The authors examine whether firms respond in an alternative way by altering advertising investments in an effort to ward off the financial damage associated with shareholder complaints. By analyzing a unique data set of shareholder complaints submitted to S&amp;P 1500 firms between 2001 and 2016, supplemented with qualitative interviews of executives of publicly listed firms, the authors document that firms increase advertising investments following shareholder complaints and that such an advertising investment response mitigates a postcomplaint decline in firm value. Furthermore, results suggest that firms are more likely to increase advertising investments when shareholder complaints are submitted by institutional investors, pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and relate to topics that receive high media attention. The findings provide new insights on how firms address stock market adversities with advertising investments and inform managers about the effectiveness of such a response.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: advertising investments; firm value; market impact; marketing strategy; shareholder proposals; stock</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the nature and management of customer complaints is well understood in marketing literature (e.g., [42]; [56]; [74]; [76]), much less is known about the management of complaints from another key stakeholder group—the firm's shareholders. Shareholders dissatisfied with the firm's strategy can file complaints with the firm, which are then discussed at the firm's next annual general meeting (AGM). Such complaints can pertain to a broad range of perceived firm deficiencies, including poor financial performance and governance, insufficient new product introductions, incoherent strategy, or turnover in leadership ([115]). The lack of shareholder complaint research in marketing is surprising given that shareholders have emerged as a key stakeholder to the marketing function, which should be regarded "as a customer in its own right" ([54], p. 115), and as an "input into marketing decision-making" ([118], p. 2). The paucity of attention to this topic in marketing research is also surprising because shareholder complaints often directly address issues that are highly relevant to marketing executives, such as a firm's product portfolio, communications, or consumer welfare.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regardless of their content, shareholder complaints typically inflict substantial financial damage on firms because they tarnish the firm's reputation, undermine investor confidence, and impose administrative costs that divert management attention from running the business (e.g., [103]; [125]). Despite these stakes, marketing and other executives seem unprepared regarding how to respond to shareholder complaints ([25]; [115]). What we <em>do</em> know, based on finance, corporate governance, and management literature, is that managers typically do not respond by actually implementing the changes that shareholders request in their complaints (e.g., [46]). What we do <em>not</em> know is whether managers respond in alternative ways and whether such responses mitigate the complaints' financial harm on firm value. In this article, we propose that a marketing response in the form of advertising investments is such an alternative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms respond to shareholder complaints by adjusting their advertising investments, but the direction and magnitude of such adjustments are unclear. The chief executive officer of advertising agency WPP, for instance, notes that "many of the world's largest consumer goods companies are slashing costs...amid pressure from [complaining] investors....And when it comes to cutting costs, advertising is one of the first places companies look to trim" ([<a id="bib9up

By contrast, PepsiCo, "after earlier [complaint] pressure from investors,...increased advertising and marketing spending on its biggest brands" ([<a id="bib8up

A review of the few studies that examine how shareholder behavior (other than shareholder complaints) affects marketing investments suggests that firms reduce marketing investments when facing challenging conditions in the stock market. For instance, this research finds that firms reduce marketing investments when their stock price falls ([13]), when they need additional equity financing ([90]), or when investor sentiment is low ([85]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research complements these previous studies in two ways. First, by examining shareholder complaints, we focus on a different, yet no less serious, type of stock market adversity. Second, contrary to the common view that firms cut marketing investments when challenged by the stock market, we turn to an investor perception management perspective and propose that firms have incentives to <em>increase</em> their advertising investments when receiving shareholder complaints. The rationale stems from prior research that recognizes that firms use advertising "not only to promote their products and services to customers but also as a communication channel to their current and potential future investors" ([40], p. 626).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Against this backdrop, we offer a conceptual framework through which we examine three research questions. First, do firms increase advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints? We focus on advertising investments as the focal marketing response because these investments are likely to be visible to shareholders and account for the bulk of marketing budgets (e.g., [23]; [70]). Furthermore, [13] document that firms are more willing to alter advertising investments than other marketing activities in response to shareholder behavior. We argue that to offset the financial damage from shareholder complaints, firms increase advertising investments—a strategy we label "advertising investment response."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, how does shareholder complaint salience moderate a firm's advertising investment response? Borrowing from stakeholder theory, we predict that complaints are more likely to induce a firm response if they are more salient by involving more power, legitimacy, or urgency ([87]). Specifically, we examine whether firms are more responsive to shareholder complaints that are submitted by institutional investors (and thus are more powerful), relate to nonfinancial concerns (and thus affect the firm's legitimacy among a larger body of stakeholders), and receive greater media attention for their underlying topics (and thus are more urgent).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, if firms increase advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints, is such a strategy effective in protecting firm value? We focus on firm value, proxied by Tobin's q measure of intangible firm value, as our performance metric because it is a widely adopted and managerially important measure to assess the effectiveness of firm strategies in general ([78]) and advertising investments in particular ([101]). Given the established negative effect that shareholder complaints have on firm value (e.g., [103]; [125]), we examine whether an advertising investment response mitigates such a decrease.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We investigate these questions using a data set covering shareholder complaints submitted to S&amp;P 1500 firms from 2001 until 2016. Results indicate that firms indeed increase advertising investments after receiving shareholder complaints. In line with our theorizing, we also find that firms are more likely to increase advertising investments when complaints are more salient—that is, when they are submitted by institutional investors, when they pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and when media attention to their topics is high. Finally, we show that increased advertising investments mitigate the negative effects of shareholder complaints on firm value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The insights from our analyses are important from both theoretical and practitioner viewpoints. First, in response to [24] call for more empirical work on the effects of shareholder behavior on firms' marketing investments, we introduce shareholder complaints as a stock market challenge relevant to the marketing field but that has been thus far unaddressed by prior research. Second, in doing so, we offer a conceptual framework that examines the strategic role of advertising investments in responding to shareholder complaints. Relying on the investor perception management perspective and stakeholder theory, we argue that firms will take stronger action when shareholder complaint salience is high. Specifically, our study is the first to introduce, operationalize, and empirically test how shareholder complaint submitter, complaint type, and media attention about the complaint's topic influence a firm's advertising investment response. Third, our results show that advertising investments are an effective strategy for mitigating the financial damage caused by shareholder complaints. Post hoc analyses show that the majority of firms still underinvest in advertising when facing shareholder complaints, which highlights the need for corrective action by managers.</p><a id="AN0136892981-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-2" title="The Firm Challenge of Shareholder Complaints">The Firm Challenge of Shareholder Complaints</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A publicly listed firm is owned by shareholders who do not directly control its strategic or operational decisions but have delegated these tasks to the firm's managers. If shareholders believe that managers' decisions are detrimental, they can file formal complaints with the firm, which are registered as shareholder proposals. Once a proposal is submitted, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules require the firm to put it up for vote at the next AGM, unless the shareholder withdraws it or the SEC provides permission to exclude it from consideration.[<a id="bib5up

Two types of adverse effects emanate from shareholder complaints. First, complaints can threaten a firm's stock market performance because shareholders motivated to file complaints may also be inclined to sell their shares and thus depress the firm's stock price. This action might, in turn, persuade other current shareholders to sell their stocks and dissuade prospective investors from buying the firm's stock.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, complaints can compromise firm value if they spill over to nonfinancial stakeholders of the firm ([26]). The implications can be severe given that nonfinancial stakeholders make consumption and employment decisions that directly affect firm performance (e.g., [78]; [119]). Such spillovers are possible given that many shareholder complaints relate to domains that affect nonfinancial stakeholders. For example, shareholder complaints can alert prospective employees about a firm's flawed strategy and governance ([121]), or customers may learn about problems with a firm's product strategy ([26]). In one public controversy, for instance, McDonald's shareholders criticized the company for ignoring childhood obesity and diet-related diseases in its product portfolio strategy ([94]). Shareholder complaints also attract significant attention from consumer advocacy groups and media outlets ([28]), especially with the rise of social media and the growing influence of user-generated content. Because complaints "tend to be played out on the front pages of the business press," spillover effects onto consumers and other stakeholders become a real threat, and the resulting "public-relations toll can be devastating" ([115], p.11).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These adversities illustrate that shareholder complaints place substantial burdens on an afflicted firm and reduce investors' expectations about the size and stability of its future cash flows. Indeed, numerous studies empirically document how shareholder complaints reduces firm value (e.g., [31]; [45]; [61]; [103]; [123]; [124]; [125]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While previous research has focused on the antecedents and outcomes of shareholder complaints (e.g., [11]; [46]; [47]), systematic research on firm response to shareholder complaints is scarce. A few existing studies find that, in general, firms do not address shareholder complaints by improving the criticized issues (e.g., [46]). However, it is not clear whether firms respond in alternative ways. We are aware of only three studies that investigate such alternative responses in firms' operational activities. [27] show that firms marginally increase research-and-development investments following shareholder complaints. [113] examines whether firms manipulate capital expenditures in response to complaints but does not find an effect. [30] report an increase in combined firm asset sales, asset spin-offs, restructuring efforts, and employee layoffs following shareholder complaints.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These studies are limited in three regards relevant to this research. First, they rely on small samples of complaints (ranging from 78 to 522 complaints) that are submitted by institutional investors only. Furthermore, the types of investment responses studied are relatively inflexible and costly to manipulate because they involve installing, customizing, or disposing of assets and staff. Finally, these studies measure the change in firm operating activities for a period of up to four years after receiving the complaint ([31]; [113]) and thus capture a gradual policy change over time rather than a direct remedial firm response. However, in today's fast-paced markets where information spreads at unprecedented speeds, firms are searching for strategies that can provide immediate defense to shareholder complaints. Increased advertising investments might be one such response strategy. We next develop a conceptual framework that outlines the use and effectiveness of advertising investments as a firm response to shareholder complaints.</p><a id="AN0136892981-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-3" title="Conceptual Framework and Hypothesis Development">Conceptual Framework and Hypothesis Development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In general, marketing literature recognizes that stock market considerations influence firm advertising investment decisions (e.g., [<a id="bib6up

Integrating stakeholder theory ([87]) with firsthand practical insights from our interviewed managers, we further identify shareholder complaint salience as a key moderator of the firm's advertising investment response (H<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>4</sub>).

Borrowing from this logic, we argue that firms increase advertising investments when shareholder complaints threaten firm value. Theoretically, we expect firms to do so given previous literature has well established the positive effect of advertising investments on firm value (e.g., [35]; [58]). This should motivate managers to increase advertising investments as a compensatory action. Specifically, managers might expect advertising investments to offset the drop in demand for the firm's stock because the heightened attention and visibility associated with increased advertising can attract new investors to replace departing ones ([<a id="bib3up

This account was also echoed by an interviewed vice president (VP) of public relations, who remarked that "investing in the advertising side of things, it can get the word out of who you are going to be and why you should bring new dollars in from other people..., churn through some of the investors, and get some new blood in." Moreover, also practically, managers might regard compensatory advertising investments as a feasible response to shareholder complaints because advertising investments are quick and easy to adjust ([23]); carry only limited downside ([81]); and, compared with other marketing activities (e.g., customer relationship management, a firm's market orientation), have a more immediate effect on firm value ([13]).

Shareholder complaints are more powerful when submitted by shareholders who have the ability to exercise economic punishment or influence (shareholder complaint submitter). Complaints have broader legitimacy if they also relate to nonfinancial stakeholder concerns (shareholder complaint type). Finally, complaints are more urgent if their underlying topics receive greater media attention (shareholder complaint topic media attention).

We propose that firms perceive complaints submitted by institutional investors as more powerful than those submitted by individual investors or coordinated activists ([27]) and thus respond more strongly through advertising investments. First, institutional investors hold a larger fraction of outstanding shares (e.g., [108]) and thereby consume more attention in managerial decision making. Second, institutional investors are more able to exert public pressure (e.g., [120]), among both shareholder communities (e.g., [46]) and the broader public. This amplifies the threat of their complaints on a firm's future expected cash flows and reinforces incentives to manage investor perceptions through advertising investments. The interviewed managers expressed a similar view. In the words of a head of investor relations, "Institutional investors, because of the size of the actual impact, would get more attention than our retail shareholder base." We thus hypothesize the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> A firm's advertising investment response to shareholder complaints is stronger if complaints are submitted by institutional investors.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0136892981-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-7" title="Shareholder complaint type">Shareholder complaint type</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Literature commonly distinguishes between financial and nonfinancial stakeholders (e.g., [63]).

We expect that complaints of a nonfinancial type hold broader legitimacy, defined by socially constructed values and norms ([87]), and thus make an advertising investment response more likely.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, nonfinancial complaints increase the threat of negative spillovers onto various stakeholder groups (e.g., [10]; [66]), which can curtail demand, spark customer boycotts, and make it difficult to recruit talent. Because nonfinancial complaints often relate to strong normative beliefs and are comparatively easy for the public to understand, stakeholder backlash might be particularly strong and harmful to future expected cash flows (e.g., [59]), which reinforces firm incentives to engage in an advertising investment response. Second, nonfinancial complaints may raise doubts about broader strategic issues than complaints about financial or governance aspects because nonfinancial complaints tend to directly relate to the firm's business model, values, and operations. This further amplifies the perceived harm of shareholder complaints on a firm's future expected cash flows and reinforces incentives to directly manage investor perceptions through increasing advertising investments. In the words of an interviewed chief financial officer (CFO), "When you are dealing with nonfinancial complaints, it is logical to invest more in advertising and communication, because the downside risk is larger."

We expect that complaints about topics that receive greater media attention make an advertising investment response more likely because managers perceive a greater urgency to react. First, if an issue is of high concern, stakeholders have a stronger motivation to act on it and eschew the firm (e.g., [36]; [122]). Managers might therefore be more alarmed that shareholder complaints translate into real economic costs and be more likely to consider an advertising investment response as defense. Second, managers make decisions on the basis of the issues they and their firm's stakeholders focus attention on ([34]; [86]; [98]), and media coverage of a shareholder complaint topic likely draws their attention. Accordingly, such complaints are considered more critical, and managers are more likely to act through an advertising investment response. In line with this expectation, an interviewed head of investor relations stated, "I would be more likely to respond to issues that are in the press lately." Accordingly, we hypothesize:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H4: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> A firm's advertising investment response to shareholder complaints is stronger if complaint topics receive greater media attention.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0136892981-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-9" title="Effectiveness of an Advertising Investment Response in Mitigating Firm Value Decline">Effectiveness of an Advertising Investment Response in Mitigating Firm Value Decline</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We complete our conceptual framework by theorizing that an advertising investment response can actually mitigate the negative impact of shareholder complaints on firm value. The underlying mechanism is two-fold. First, investing in advertising signals firm financial health, product market prospects, and an otherwise sound strategy ([32]; [65]; [67]), which should render investors less sensitive to devaluing the firm following shareholder complaints. As an interviewed VP of public relations remarked, "It just puts a positive spin on the company itself." In addition, the positive affect induced through advertising might make investors more forgiving about performance deficiencies related to shareholder complaints. This is because investors, like other stakeholders, react less strongly to adverse news when emotionally connected with and positively inclined toward a firm ([84]). An interviewed VP of public relations explicitly mentioned that advertising can weaken the negative valence of shareholder complaints, as "Putting more money into advertising...is a way to get shareholders to look at whatever is the other shiny object and distract their attention away from the complaint."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, advertising investments might also lessen the negative spillover effects of shareholder complaints on nonfinancial stakeholders of the firm. As such, the positive attitudes and emotional connection that advertising fosters among these stakeholders might alleviate repercussions in product and labor markets and weaken the resulting drop in firm value. As exemplified by the statement of an interviewed CFO, "Advertising could address concerns by some people who think we are not a good company by letting them and the broader market know we are." For these reasons, we formally hypothesize:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The negative effect of shareholder complaints on firm value is mitigated by a firm's advertising investment response.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0136892981-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-10" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0136892981-11"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-11" title="Data Sources and Sample">Data Sources and Sample</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We assemble a data set consisting of detailed information on all shareholder complaints received by S&amp;P 1500 firms, advertising investments, firm value, shareholder complaint media attention, and a set of control variables from 2001 until 2016. We collect the first part of the data set from RiskMetrics, formerly the Investor Responsibility Research Center. This database covers complete annual shareholder complaint data for S&amp;P 1500 firms, comprising 15,727 complaints. The database is unique in that it also includes data on withdrawn and omitted complaints submitted to firms but not put up for vote at the AGM. Of the 15,727 submitted complaints, 6,995 (i.e., 44.48%) are omitted or withdrawn. However, because including only complaints put up for vote at the AGM might not accurately reflect the true extent of shareholder dissatisfaction, we also incorporate these omitted or withdrawn complaints and thus circumvent the selection bias in other studies, which only use the complaints shareholders eventually voted on ([60]). Moreover, our interviews suggest that managers consider shareholder complaints irrespective of whether they are eventually withdrawn. In the words of a VP of public relations, "Once the complaint is out, you have to respond....You have to think that there are going to be other investors who are thinking the same thing..., even if [the complaints] were withdrawn."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because RiskMetrics covers only firm-year observations in which shareholder complaints are observed, we add a control group of firms that were part of the S&amp;P 1500 for at least one year during the 2001–2016 period and were tracked by Compustat but do not appear in the RiskMetrics database because they did not receive any shareholder complaints. Using the Compustat Execucomp database, we identify a total of 411 possible control firms. In unreported analyses, we confirm that across all firm-year observations, neither the firms receiving shareholder complaints nor the control firms significantly differ from the universe of firms covered in Compustat in terms of the control variables we outline in the next section.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We retrieve advertising investment data from Kantar Media, a leading source of advertising data.

Doing so is important to ensure that the term "year" is the same for all firms in our sample, and that all firms are subject to the same industry conditions. The final sample consists of unbalanced annual panel data for 831 firms (656 firms receiving shareholder complaints and 175 control firms).

To avoid losing firm-year observations with zero complaints, we follow [79] procedure and add 1 to the actual value before the logarithmic transformation.[10] We use the lagged level of shareholder complaints because shareholders submit their complaints toward the end of the fiscal year. To explain, SEC regulations require shareholders to submit complaints 120 calendar days before AGM materials are mailed to shareholders. For firms whose fiscal year ends on December 31, the AGM takes place in April and firms send the AGM materials to shareholders 30 to 50 days beforehand. Thus, for such firms, shareholder complaints are received by the end of November of the previous year and they become public anytime between January and March. Specifically, complaints discussed at the AGM become public through shareholders announcing their complaints or when firms send out preinformation about opposing the complaints, both of which tend to occur in January or February ([38]). If complaints are withdrawn or omitted, they become public when the SEC publishes this information, usually anytime from January until the AGM takes place ([109]). As a result, firms learn about shareholder complaints in the fourth quarter of the previous year, and other shareholders and the public learn about shareholder complaints in the first quarter of the current year.</p><a id="AN0136892981-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-14" title="Advertising investments">Advertising investments</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our measure of advertising investments is Kantar Media's annual advertising investments estimate, which we aggregate across a firm's brands to arrive at a firm-year level.

To account for the correlation in the dependent variable over time, we use an instrumental variable first-difference estimator to generate consistent parameter estimates (see [88]).[12] Our modeling acknowledges that the past advertising investment level serves as an anchor point in setting the advertising budget in the current period (e.g., [53]; [102]). It allows for a one-period transitory effect of advertising investment deviations such that advertising investments can return to prior normal levels if no shareholder complaints are received in consecutive years (note that in 89% of our firm-year observations, firms do not receive shareholder complaints in consecutive years and can therefore reset their advertising investments to previous normal levels).

Tobin's q is the ratio of a firm's market value to the replacement cost of its tangible assets and provides a measure of the premium (or discount) that the market is willing to pay above (below) the replacement costs of a firm's tangible assets, thus capturing any above-normal returns expected from the firm's tangible assets ([<a id="bib1up

It has several advantages as a performance metric because it is derived from the stock price and thus is forward-looking, risk-adjusted, and less easily manipulated by managers.

To operationalize the shareholder complaint nonfinancial type variable, we use the following procedure to distinguish shareholder complaints that address nonfinancial concerns from those that address financial concerns. RiskMetrics classifies each complaint as relating to either financial/governance or social responsibility concerns. For our measure of nonfinancial concerns, we use the complaints classified as social responsibility concerns. To verify that all corporate social responsibility concerns indeed relate to nonfinancial concerns, we pull the detailed complaint descriptions from RiskMetrics and review each complaint. Two independent coders confirm that all complaints (i.e., κ = 1.00) unambiguously relate to nonfinancial concerns. We then create a variable indicating the firm's yearly percentage of complaints that were defined as relating to nonfinancial concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We operationalize the shareholder complaint topic media attention variable as the yearly media coverage about the topic addressed in a given complaint as captured on LexisNexis. RiskMetrics summarizes the topic of each complaint in a short description nine words or fewer (91% of the summaries have fewer than six words), which we clean of filler words and use as index terms in our media search. We count all articles that mention the respective topic within a given year and that LexisNexis ranks with a relevancy score of at least 60%, net of duplicates in the same newspaper outlet ([69]). To control for scale effects of the topics, we normalize topic media coverage in a given year by the topic's total media coverage over the sample period. In years in which a firm receives multiple shareholder complaints, we compute the arithmetic mean across the topic media coverage scores to arrive at our firm-year measure of shareholder complaint topic media attention.

In line with this literature, we include these covariates as levels, not as unexpected changes, and winsorize them at 1% to reduce the impact of outliers. For our model estimating advertising investments, our controls of financial flexibility include the logarithm of operating cash flows because firms alter their advertising levels due to financial constraints and affordability effects in the product market ([13]). As suggested by prior literature ([13]; [78]), we also control for financial leverage. On the one hand, financial leverage may reduce the firm's flexibility in terms of resource allocation and spending behavior ([55]). On the other hand, firms profit from higher financial leverage through tax benefits related to deductible interest payments, which can result in higher spending levels. To calculate firm leverage, we divide long-term debt by the book value of assets ([107]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We include sales growth as a control for product market performance, measured as the percentage change in gross sales from the preceding year ([20]). Controlling for firm stock market performance, we include stock returns ([81]). Because firms tend to be benchmarked against their industry peers for stock performance comparisons, we follow [14] and use a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the firm's stock return exceeds industry-averaged stock returns and 0 otherwise. Industry average returns are the equally weighted average of stock returns of all firms in a given four-digit SIC industry. We add a control for firm size to account for economies of scale ([20]), which we operationalize as the logarithm of total assets. We employ one-period lags of the control variables because this represents the most recent information available to managers when they decide on budgets at the beginning of the current period ([14]; [24]). Finally, we include controls for shareholder complaint details that are not captured by our moderating factors but could influence an advertising investment response. Specifically, we control for the percentage of excluded shareholder complaints not discussed at the firm's AGM and the percentage of shareholder complaints with voting support exceeding 50%.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For our model estimating the effectiveness of an advertising investment response, we control for a firm's financial flexibility by including financial leverage, measured as described previously. Because theoretical arguments and empirical evidence are strong but equivocal for the relationship between financial leverage and Tobin's q, we include it as a covariate without specifying the expected sign of the relationship ([78]). We include market share as a control for product market performance, which has been shown to positively influence Tobin's q ([39]). Market share is expressed as the fraction of firm sales revenues divided by sales revenues of all firms in the same four-digit SIC industry. We also include sales growth because a higher growth rate might indicate higher future growth prospects that result in higher values of Tobin's q ([106]). Our controls also include profitability, which is expected to have a positive effect on Tobin's q ([49]). We use return on assets (ROA) as our profitability measure, which is the ratio of operating income before depreciation by total assets.

To test H<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>4</sub>, we focus on the interaction effects between shareholder complaints and the respective salience moderator variable (i.e., institutional submitter, nonfinancial type, and topic media attention).[13] Regarding shareholder complaint submitter, we find that institutional investors increase the strength of an advertising investment response (β =.015, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), consistent with H<sub>2</sub>.

We estimate Equation 3 including only shareholder complaints and control variables, as shown in Column 1 of Table 4, and advertising investments and control variables, as shown in Column 2. Our focus, however, is on the full model in Column 3. The model is statistically significant (F = 25.48, <em>p</em> &lt;.01) and explains incremental variance. Because the VIFs are below ten, this confirms that multicollinearity is of no concern for our analyses. We find that the control variables have the expected signs, although financial leverage is not significant. Confirming prior research, shareholder complaints are negatively related to firm value (β = −.212, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), which highlights the need for remedial action on receiving them. Moreover, our results suggest that increasing advertising investments is an effective firm response that successfully mitigates the postcomplaint firm value decline (β =.003, <em>p</em> &lt;.05), as predicted in H<sub>5</sub> and consistent with the theory of investor perception management. We also reestimate Equation 3 without profitability as a control variable.

Using this proxy, we do not find that shareholder complaints drive sales force investments (β =.070, n.s.). Second, moving beyond the marketing domain, we test whether firms reduce capital expenditures, as reported in Compustat, after encountering shareholder complaints. Capital expenditures decrease current earnings but do not help in managing investor perceptions.

To test this competing explanation, we examine the detailed content of each shareholder complaint that includes the words "advertising," "marketing," or "promotion," but find no evidence for any demands directly related to an advertising increase (N = 0). Because SEC regulations allow companies to ignore complaints related to ordinary business operations, such as advertising, the lack of complaints requesting advertising increases is not surprising. However, to the extent that an advertising-related complaint concerns fundamental business strategy, it is not considered ordinary business and is eligible for submission. We find only a few complaints of that type in our data set (N = 56). Examples are complaints about advertising tobacco to minors and about advertising containing ethically controversial images.

First, industries differ in the importance that investors attach to a firm's earnings numbers, and previous literature has suggested that such industry earnings pressure influences a firm's discretionary investment levels ([<a id="bib2up

Consequently, we expect firms operating in industries in which stock prices are highly sensitive to earnings information to be more cautious about increasing advertising investments. We proxy industry return sensitivity to earnings by the coefficient of a regression of earnings against firm stock returns ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref157" title="2">2</a>]). Interacting industry return sensitivity to earnings with shareholder complaints, analogous to the interactions in Equation 2, we find that higher return sensitivity to earnings is associated with a marginally lower increase in advertising investments (β = −.001, <em>p</em> &lt;.10).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we argue that visibility and potential spillovers onto nonfinancial stakeholders explain why firms resort to advertising investments when facing shareholder complaints. Thus, firms should be more likely to increase advertising investments if visibility among a broader set of stakeholders is large and if the overlap between the product market and the stock market is high. Previous literature has argued that market structures vary in these regards across business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets ([68]), and we therefore test whether firms are more likely to increase their advertising investments when operating in a B2C versus a B2B industry. Including B2C industry membership as an interacted dummy with shareholder complaints, while excluding the firm fixed effects in Equation 2, we find marginal support for this argument (β =.001, <em>p</em> &lt;.10).</p><a id="AN0136892981-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-32" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shareholders and their concerns have recently attracted marketing's attention as firms are increasingly challenged to manage stock markets and product markets symbiotically. In this article, we focus on shareholder complaints, a prominent form of stock market adversity, and study how firms use advertising investments to mitigate the drop in firm value following shareholder complaints. Three key takeaways are as follows: First, contrary to the often-documented observation that firms decrease marketing investments when challenged by the stock market, we find that, in the context of shareholder complaints, firms increase advertising investments to improve investor perceptions. Second, firms are more likely to increase advertising investments if shareholder complaints are more salient (i.e., are submitted by institutional investors, relate to nonfinancial concerns, or if the topics of the complaints receive more media attention). Third, advertising investments are an effective instrument for mitigating the firm value decline following shareholder complaints. Our results have various implications for marketing theory and practice, which we discuss next.</p><a id="AN0136892981-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-33" title="Theoretical Implications: Dynamics of Stock Markets and Product Markets">Theoretical Implications: Dynamics of Stock Markets and Product Markets</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While a substantial amount of research has explored how marketing investments drive shareholder behavior (e.g., [107]; [116]), a small number of studies have begun to investigate whether shareholder behavior can also have feedback effects on marketing investments. This research tends to focus on the impact of stock prices. Our study sheds light on a distinctive, yet hitherto overlooked, aspect of shareholder behavior—shareholder complaints—that is increasingly relevant for firm managers and, as we show, for their advertising investment decisions. Combining our results with the findings of other stock market feedback studies (e.g., [<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref161" title="6">6</a>]; [88]) leads to the conclusion that adverse stock market pressures do not always result in marketing investment cuts, as per an earnings management perspective. Instead, in support of an investor perception management perspective, firms might find it more effective to directly manage firm value through increasing advertising investments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expect two drivers to explain this phenomenon. First, shareholder complaints often pertain to nonfinancial issues, so soothing investors financially by cutting advertising investments is unlikely to be effective because these complaints are not financially motivated in the first place. Considering that the general quest of maximizing profits is often at odds with consumer welfare and corporate social responsibility (e.g., [66]), cutting advertising investments as a response to nonfinancial concerns may even be considered counterproductive by investors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, firms that encounter shareholder complaints tend to display mediocre to bad earnings performance, either because of poor past strategic choices that caused complaints or because of processing complaints in the current period.[15] Finance literature suggests that if firms miss earnings expectations, even if only by a thin margin, they bank any additional earnings until a later period when they can use those earnings to meet or exceed expectations (e.g., [30]; [111]). Likewise, this literature finds that incentives to manage earnings are higher for firms that have consecutively reported high or increasing earnings in the recent past, and not for those that have reported poor earnings ([95]). This point is also discussed in [13], who argue that it is good past performance that induces short-term earnings pressures. Given the poor past performance of firms receiving shareholder complaints, these firms might have lower motivation to engage in earnings management.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As such, our findings also pertain to the recent discourse on profit versus value maximization. Multiple articles in this area argue that marketing actions that increase profits may not necessarily increase firm value (e.g., [118]). We add to this discussion by showing that marketing actions that decrease profits may not always decrease firm value. In this regard, our results correspond closely with those of [44], who study product-harm crises and find that although increasing advertising investments reduces firm profit, it nevertheless mitigates the loss in firm value. In other words, reductions in accounting profit do not always lead to reductions in economic profit, not even in the short run. This is an encouraging finding for marketing practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our findings also add to the literature that studies how firms can attenuate crisis situations through marketing investments. The traditional focus of the marketing function has been the product market, with an array of research studying how firms employ advertising instruments to address adversities emanating from product markets, such as consumer complaints (e.g., [73]), product regulation (e.g., [92]), or product-harm crises (e.g., [22]). Other research shows how advertising investments help firms during recessions (e.g., [117]). Adding to this literature, we show that advertising investments not only are a compelling way to address product-market crises but also can mitigate the adverse effects of shareholder crises.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of adverse performance effects, our focus is on firm value, which is a function of both future expected cash flows and firm risk. Given the strong risk-reducing properties of advertising investments (e.g., [75]; [83]), coinciding with the weakened investor confidence in the firm when receiving shareholder complaints, the channel through which advertising investments protect firm value might be by reducing firm risk. To test for this benefit, we run an exploratory test in which we interact shareholder complaints with advertising investments and regress this variable on firm risk, measured as the standard deviation of the residuals of the firm's four-factor stock price model in year t ([13]). The model mimics Equation 3 but replaces Tobin's q with firm risk. Results are of the expected direction, but advertising investments are marginally insignificant in reducing firm risk after encountering shareholder complaints (β = −.043, n.s.).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, our results contribute to a better understanding of the corporate governance literature relative to marketing actions. Previous literature, as well as our data, has shown that firms rarely respond directly to the issues raised in shareholder complaints (e.g., [46]). Presumably, managers regard their own information about the firm to be superior to that held by shareholders ([114]) or fear that shareholders seek only short-term gains. This perspective is shared by scholars and commentators who claim that shareholder complaints only distract management from their duties and that outside investors lack the necessary skills and experience to optimize management's decisions ([112]; [126]). Our qualitative interviews support this idea, with one of the interviewed CFOs stating that "shareholders follow your firm from a distance and are not involved in the daily development of your strategy and the considerations involved." In addition, whereas some complaints reflect shareholders' discontent with an issue in which they are highly involved, other complaints result from a more general "we are not happy" sentiment ([104]), making it difficult for management to cure shareholder dissatisfaction by taking direct action. We do not take a stance on whether shareholder complaints are reasonable or whether firms' refusal to implement proposed changes is warranted. However, we show that firms do react to these complaints, namely by altering their advertising investments, and we show that this response is effective in terms of protecting firm value. This is another reassuring finding for marketing practice.</p><a id="AN0136892981-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-34" title="Managerial Implications: Strategic Action Plan for Firms Facing Shareholder Complaints">Managerial Implications: Strategic Action Plan for Firms Facing Shareholder Complaints</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In light of our findings from both the qualitative interviews and econometric analyses, we suggest a three-step action plan for managers facing shareholder complaints.

We next provide details on each step and offer actionable guidelines.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first step involves managers closely analyzing the actual content of received complaints and assessing whether they should respond by changing any aspect of their business operations. For example, this could be the case when shareholders point to shortcomings in the firm's operations or supply chain, which managers should acknowledge as market intelligence and change accordingly. Although previous literature has shown that firms typically neglect such insights, we suggest that managers should always be vigilant to maximize their firm's strategic potential and remain attentive to shareholder feedback in accomplishing this objective. In the words of a CFO we interviewed, "You have to engage in a dialogue with shareholders who suggest that your value proposition is not optimal," and "Shareholders have the right to indicate this to you."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, irrespective of whether the firm implements the issue shareholders complain about, managers should next evaluate the impact of the complaint and consider actions to alleviate the harm that complaints inflict on firm value. Our findings corroborate that shareholder complaints substantially reduce firm value but also identify advertising investments as an effective tool to protect firm value. To further demonstrate the impact of increasing advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints, we perform a counterfactual analysis that answers two questions. First, for firms that increased their advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints, what was their incremental improvement in firm value compared with if they had not increased investments? Second, for firms that did not increase their advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints, what was their incremental loss compared with if they had increased investments? For this analysis, we employ a switching regression methodology (e.g., [16]), detailed in Web Appendix F. In essence, we use a first-stage regression to predict the probability of a firm increasing its advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints and derive the inverse Mills ratio as the selection correction variable. In a second stage, we then regress firm value on the inverse Mills ratio and the control variables, separately for firms that increase advertising investments and those that do not. Finally, we use the predicted firm values from the second-stage estimation to conduct the what-if analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We find that firms that increased their advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints achieved an incremental gain of.057, or 3.5%, in firm value compared with if they had not increased these investments. By contrast, firms that did not increase their advertising investments in response to shareholder complaints gave up an incremental lift in firm value of.152, or 1.3%, compared with if they had increased their investments. These results underscore our general finding that advertising investments help protect firm value in the face of shareholder complaints, but, perhaps even more importantly, they also show how a firm jeopardizes firm value if it decides against an advertising response.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although these results underscore the benefits of an advertising investment response to shareholder complaints in general, they do not indicate the optimal level of increasing advertising investments. As a second analysis, we therefore perform a marginal effects analysis based on the estimated coefficients from Equation 3 in Table 4 (Web Appendix G overviews the details). This approach has been applied in marketing by [80] and [117] and provides two important insights. First, it describes how to calculate firm-specific marginal effects and how to statistically assess whether a given firm underspends, overspends, or spends at an approximately optimal level. As such, when faced with shareholder complaints, managers can readily use our model as a decision aid to examine whether they advertise at optimal levels. Second, after performing such an analysis for the firms in our sample, we find that the majority of firms underinvest in advertising following shareholder complaints. Notably, though, if shareholder complaint salience is high (i.e., if complaints are submitted by institutional investors, pertain to nonfinancial concerns, or relate to topics that receive higher media attention), firms invest close to an optimal level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Combining all the findings from our article, we conclude that firms increase their advertising investments following shareholder complaints, yet most do not do so sufficiently, especially if shareholder complaint salience is low (i.e., if the complaint is not submitted by an institutional investor, does not pertain to nonfinancial concerns, and does not discuss topics receiving large media attention). This conclusion is striking because firms jeopardize substantial firm value by underutilizing an advertising investment response. We thus caution managers not to underspend on advertising in response to shareholder complaints, especially when the complaints appear less salient and managers may thus feel less of an urge to manage investor perceptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, when contemplating the extent of increasing advertising investments, managers should also consider how to best implement an advertising investment response. This includes taking into account the differential effects of advertising media types. As shown in our additional analysis, television and outdoor advertising seem marginally more effective at mitigating the drop in firm value. We conjecture that television advertising is beneficial because of its large short-term elasticity compared with print or combined advertising and because it is built on emotional rather than informative appeals, which is essential in nurturing investors' affect to the firm ([110]). Likewise, outdoor advertising is known for increasing awareness and broadening visibility ([68]). Although our focus is on advertising investments, the qualitative interviews help explore how to design the advertising content. An interviewed head of investor relations noted a role of "advertising to explain your strategy...and reiterate why it is a good strategy." In the words of an interviewed chief financial controller, "Advertising is not just about the underlying product, it is about letting [the market] know we are a good company."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Insights from the qualitative interviews further suggest the importance of coordinating an advertising investment response with other functions in the firm, such as public relations. For instance, as stated by one chief financial controller, "It is also about public relations and sponsorships to try and appease [complaining shareholders]." Another CFO noted that "using interviews and articles in the business press are good ways to correct impressions of the market and wider stakeholder groups." If complaints pertain to nonfinancial issues, another route might involve "independent parties [to] help shape the public discussion in your favor, such as interest groups," as one CFO recommended. Unilever, for instance, started a well-publicized collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund after being criticized by shareholders for its lack of sustainability efforts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Likewise, the firm's investor relations department might be an important partner to design an advertising investment response. Often considered a strategic corporate marketing activity ([33]), it is well-placed to advise how to address concerned shareholders in terms of message content and how best to reach shareholders. This could include, for instance, "presenting yourself on conferences, expos, and symposia," as one chief financial controller noted, or "to be present at investor roadshows." In any case, quoting a head of investor relations, "Investor relations, public relations, and marketing [have to] work together very closely in addressing shareholder complaints."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, firms might look for external partners to better communicate their value proposition to the investor community and amplify their advertising efforts. One such partner might be analysts who channel information between firms and investors and help "validate the business logic underlying the advertising expense" ([77], p. 607). As a head of investor relations stated, "Depending on the issue at hand, we have a direct line to the analysts," while a VP of public relations shared that "having analysts as a kind of intermediary or go-between is a great way to defuse an issue that might come up with complaining investors, especially as analysts have spent time with us and really know our products and what we are trying to do."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To conclude, our research suggests that managers should consider the broader implications of an advertising investment strategy across both product and financial markets. Managing the dynamics between advertising investments and the stock market becomes an even more pressing task as shareholder complaints increasingly deal with topics directly under marketing's responsibility. We believe that our findings arm marketing managers with stronger justifications for their advertising budget decisions, their position in the C-suite and at the board level, and their organizational impact to counter the threat of marginalized marketing responsibilities ([107]). That being said, advertising investment decisions should always be part of a coherent long-term marketing strategy, ideally one that aligns shareholders' interests with firm strategy and prevents shareholder dissatisfaction in the first place ([67]).</p><a id="AN0136892981-35"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-35" title="Limitations and Directions for Further Research">Limitations and Directions for Further Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">With the novelty of our research come certain limitations that provide avenues for future research. One topic for future research is a more detailed investigation of the roles of different functions within a firm and how they might help coordinate an advertising investment response, as suggested by our qualitative interviews. Relatedly, while beyond the scope of the present research, it may be worthwhile to consider other, perhaps competing, responses that managers could use when confronted with complaining shareholders. We offer some first ideas in our additional analyses and invite future research to explore this path in more detail. In addition, firm contingencies could affect an advertising response to shareholder complaints and moderate the effectiveness of such a response. Firm factors that relate to spillover effects between investors and nonfinancial stakeholders might play a role, such as a firm's proportion of retail investors, who have been shown to respond more strongly to advertising investments ([71]). The firm's strategic emphasis on advertising might be another factor influencing firm advertising responsiveness to shareholder complaints ([89]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moreover, it is possible that shareholder complaints moderate the effectiveness of a firm's advertising investments, in addition to advertising investments protecting firm value, as we find in the current research. Literature on product crisis management suggests such effects during times of crisis (e.g., [21]), and future research might provide insights on this matter in the context of shareholder complaints. An interesting finding we note in Table 3 is the negative association of the percentage of excluded complaints with a firm's advertising investments. This result is surprising because when budget decisions are made, the firm does not yet know whether complaints will be withdrawn or omitted, because this information tends to be revealed only at a later point, possibly until the day of the AGM. One might speculate that, over time, firms develop knowledge about the likelihood of complaints being withdrawn or omitted so they can make more informed decisions at the time budgets are set. Alternatively, if advertising budgets are very flexible, firms might be able to undo or reduce the planned increase in advertising investments in cases in which the threat of shareholder dissatisfaction disappears. Future research might help uncover these dynamics.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, our modeling of unexpected advertising investments assumes a transitory effect of advertising deviating from expected levels in a given year. At the same time, we cannot exclude the possibility that shareholder complaints could have a more permanent bearing on the firm's future advertising investments. This could be the case if the firm learns about strategy shortcomings through complaints and decides to combat it through advertising. This is an interesting conjecture that we hope future research will address.</p><a id="AN0136892981-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-36" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research to date has provided inconclusive views on how firms adjust marketing investments in response to stock market adversities. We offer novel insights on a currently overlooked type of stock market adversity, shareholder complaints, and how firms adjust their advertising investments in response to those complaints. Our findings suggest that firms increase their advertising investments and that the stock market rewards them for doing so. Specifically, an advertising investment response to shareholder complaints helps reduce the postcomplaint drop in firm value. Furthermore, we find that more salient shareholder complaints—that is, those submitted by institutional investors, relating to nonfinancial concerns, and relating to topics receiving more media attention—make an increase in advertising investments more likely. Our results offer important implications for marketing theory about how shareholder feedback drives advertising investments as well as practical insights to support managers to make timely and appropriate advertising investment decisions on receiving shareholder complaints.</p><a id="AN0136892981-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0136892981-37" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919841584 - Can Advertising Investments Counter the Negative Impact of Shareholder Complaints on Firm Value?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, DS_10.1177_0022242919841584 for Can Advertising Investments Counter the Negative Impact of Shareholder Complaints on Firm Value? by Simone Wies, Arvid Oskar Ivar Hoffmann, Jaakko Aspara and Joost M.E.

Because the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions cannot be rejected (χ<sup>2</sup> = 88.52, n.s.), the model specification meets the moment conditions and the instruments appear valid.

At the same time, the world's many economic, social, and political problems can benefit from proactive, purpose-driven marketing thought. On this stage of dynamic change and unprecedented opportunity, the marketing discipline is poised to offer new knowledge that contributes to the full range of marketing stakeholders, including the students we educate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite this potential, a great deal of marketing scholarship remains safely within the confines of its present boundaries—relying on mainstream assumptions, theories, and methods that tend to reinforce, not challenge, our thinking. Like most scientific communities, marketing has the trappings of [<a id="bib3up

Institutional and individual rewards are tilted toward incremental research that safely builds programmatic streams for tenure while a risk-averse journal review process can easily stamp out innovation. Given these forces, many early-career marketing scholars operate within the safe boundaries of the discipline while pledging to return to innovative opportunities in the later stages of their careers. Unfortunately, most never do.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is within this context that we introduce a series of innovative articles designed to inform and inspire research that broadens the current boundaries of marketing, including the phenomena, theories, methods, and findings the field considers important and interesting. Articles in this series include conceptual reexaminations that challenge assumptions in well-established research areas. These articles do so by questioning current boundaries and offering fresh research agendas. Other articles highlight new challenges to the field by offering conceptual frameworks to structure new research approaches with the potential to transform the discipline.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first of these "Challenging the Boundaries of Marketing" articles appears in the current issue and focuses on "Marketing in the Sharing Economy" ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref2" title="2">2</a>]). We asked this team of authors to investigate the changing nature of marketing in the sharing economy—a critical perspective that has been missing from most research published in marketing journals. Defining the sharing economy as a scalable socioeconomic system that employs technology-enabled platforms to provide users with temporary access to tangible and intangible resources that may be crowdsourced, the paper examines how the sharing economy forces us to rethink three foundations of marketing: <em>institutions</em> (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), <em>processes</em> (e.g., innovation, brands, customer experience, value appropriation), and <em>value creation</em> (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society). Importantly, the article offers wide-ranging future research opportunities that confront the boundaries of marketing thought.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These authors, Giana Eckhardt, Mark Houston, Baojun Jiang, Cait Lamberton, Aric Rindfleisch, and Georgios Zervas, examine the sharing economy from remarkably diverse perspectives and methodological approaches, representing marketing strategy, empirical modeling, analytic modeling, mainstream consumer research, and consumer cultural theory. This interdisciplinary perspective reinforces the <em>Journal of Marketing</em>'s (<em>JM</em>'s) position as the discipline's broadest and most inclusive journal and reflects our view that the discipline will be stronger when we unite to solve the field's most pressing questions and problems. Consistent with this view, the second article in the series, "Uniting the Tribes: Using Text for Marketing Insight," is coauthored by Jonah Berger, Ashlee Humpreys, Stephan Ludwig, Wendy Moe, Oded Netzer, and David Schweidel. This article, which will be published in a [<a id="bib1up

Three primary criteria will be used for making our selections. First, the topic should be one that a large number of people in the discipline would or <em>should</em> care about. The topic should come from one of the two tails of the innovativeness spectrum—it should focus on a topic that is completely new to the field or on one that is well-worn, entrenched, and in need of a jump-start. Ideally, the topic will be an area of marketing undergoing significant change and where academic research is lagging behind real-world marketing practice. The topic should be big enough and broad enough to offer considerable research opportunities to a range of scholars in the discipline, and it should be one that can be examined from multiple perspectives (e.g., consumer, firm, market, policy, and society).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, the proposal should describe how the article will challenge the boundaries in the field. Why is the topic ripe for exploration and dismantling? What future research areas will the paper explore with fresh insights? This latter point is important because it underscores that these are not review articles. Although an assessment and integration of what we know can be fertile ground for innovation, the authors will have to plant seeds for future research when they develop the proposal into a submission. We seek thought leadership. The "Marketing in the Sharing Economy" article in this issue exemplifies the focus on new ideas by devoting over half of its content to future research directions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the proposed teams should comprise three to five members from different disciplinary and methodological traditions. We think diverse perspectives will produce the most interesting and compelling research directions. As you design your team, think about the strongest team members around the world—not your close working associates. Furthermore, you should ensure that team members will work hard to generate the strongest manuscript. Because such large-scale conceptual papers are very difficult to write, success demands that team members commit to the process of working together and to regular meetings. All other <em>JM</em> submission criteria will apply as well.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Using these criteria, with this editorial, we open the process for submissions. Importantly, there is no guarantee that these articles will be published. Teams will have to produce an important article that truly does challenge the boundaries.

The increased interactions among outlets may facilitate knowledge sharing, even while inducing intrabrand competition. Prior research has considered each possibility—knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition—in isolation, resulting in conflicting recommendations to the central question of whether multiple same-brand outlets should be close to or distant from one another. In this study, the authors take the perspective of the focal outlet and show that the opportunity to share knowledge afforded by clustering-based proximity may or may not be realized, depending on the motivation and ability of the proximal outlets to share knowledge, the focal outlet’s ability to absorb knowledge, and the governance context. An analysis of more than 8,000 observations on the 988 outlets of a U.S.-based automotive service franchise system from 1977 to 2012, and corresponding outlet-level sales information from 2004 to 2012, provides support for the authors’ hypotheses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online Supplement: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.16.0173">http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jm.16.0173</a></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Any time you open more and more units, there’s always some impact….

On the one hand, clustering can elicit richer, more frequent interactions (Ganesan, Malter, and Rindfleisch 2005), thereby facilitating knowledge sharing, that is, partners’ communication of valuable technical skills, product knowledge, know-how, as well as information about the market (Cummings 2004, p. 352; De Luca and Atuahene-Gima 2007; Ho and Ganesan 2013). On the other hand, the prospect of proximity-induced intrabrand competition—the degree to which the different outlets selling the same brand compete for the same customers—poses a daunting and real threat (Kalnins 2004; Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012). As such, should multiple same-brand outlets of a franchise system be close to or distant from one another? For both interested scholars and practitioners, this question has profound implications but remains largely unanswered.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1 summarizes relevant empirical research on the performance-related consequences of the proximity of same-brand outlets. Scholars working within a sociological tradition of clustering theory (Ganesan, Malter, and Rindfleisch 2005; Ingram and Baum 1997) have emphasized the proximity-induced opportunities for greater learning, interaction, and knowledge sharing among proximal outlets, as well as the consequent performance gains for the focal entity participating in such a cluster (Lu and Wedig 2013). The primarily economics-informed perspective on proximity (Kalnins 2004; Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012), however, emphasizes the costs imposed by the resulting intrabrand competition. As Table 1 shows, prior studies have adopted viewpoints informed by either knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition. As a result, the intriguing idea that both perspectives might be valid remains unexplored.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study represents a first effort to acknowledge and reconcile these seemingly conflicting effects of proximity. Within the context of a growing U.S.-based franchise system, we take the perspective of the focal outlet striving to leverage knowledge shared by the proximal same-brand outlets it is clustered with, while trying to avoid, or at least minimize, sales cannibalization brought about by intrabrand competition. Our conceptual framework, grounded in the literature on organizational learning (e.g., Argyris and Schön 1978; Cyert and March 1963; Sinkula 1994; Slater and Narver 1995), integrates the motivation– opportunity–ability perspective (MacInnis, Moorman, and Jaworski 1991) with work on proximity-governance linkages (Bradach 1997; Brickley and Dark 1987; Tracey, Heide, and Bell 2014) to hypothesize the conditions under which each viewpoint (knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition) might prevail, as reflected in the focal outlet’s performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Specifically, we posit that the opportunity to share knowledge afforded by clustering-based proximity may or may not be realized, depending on (<a id="bib1up

We posit that the governance context acts as a critical moderator of the clustering–performance relationship and determines the primacy of the knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition effects. In particular, we argue that the shared ownership of clustered outlets2 (i.e., multiunit operations) blunts outlet owners’ concerns about intrabrand competition, in turn affecting their motivation to share knowledge with the focal outlet (Argote and Darr 2000; Ingram and Baum 2001). We also argue that the ownership of the focal outlet (whether franchisor- or franchisee-owned) causes variation in the clustering-attributable costs and benefits. Moreover, we consider the ability inherent in the age-related experience of the outlets (i.e., the proximal outlets’ availability of knowledge gained through years of experience) and the focal outlet’s ability to value, assimilate, and apply this knowledge (i.e., its absorptive capacity) (Cohen and Levinthal 1990).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We rely on a unique multisourced data set comprising more than 8,000 observations on the 988 outlets of a large U.S.-based franchise system of automotive services across 41 states, from its inception in 1977 through 2012. Top management of the franchise system shared data on each outlet’s location, year of establishment, and corresponding sales information for a nine-year period (2004–2012), which we supplemented with information from franchise disclosure documents as well as market-specific information we collected from publicly available sources. The rich, fine-grained information allows us to assess the impact of clustering on individual outlets’ performance over nearly a decade.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We make several key contributions to the understanding of clustering and its performance consequences. First, rather than limiting our consideration to just the beneficial knowledge-sharing effects of clustering or the potentially negative intrabrand competition effects, we explicitly acknowledge and assess both possibilities. We argue that the net impact of clustering on individual outlet performance depends on the relative strength of each of these competing effects, and we identify the governance-attributable boundary conditions with respect to when one effect might dominate the other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we build on evidence indicating that the knowledge available from different proximal outlets can vary as a function of the outlets’ experience (Kalnins and Mayer 2004; Penrose 1959), and we extend this insight by also considering the focal outlet’s ability to absorb this available knowledge as a function of its own experience (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Zahra and George 2002). As we discuss subsequently, a low level of either is likely to compromise knowledge sharing between outlets, resulting in reduced performance levels. We are thus able to explain how, even within the same cluster of outlets, performance might vary as a function of the specific focal outlet and the specific proximal same-brand outlets considered. In emphasizing the role of experience of proximally located knowledge sources and recipients, we extend the notion of clustering beyond its exclusive focus on how geographically close the outlets within a cluster are to the specific identities of the focal outlet and those proximal to it.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we build on and extend recent theoretical discussions (Bell, Tracey, and Heide 2009; Tracey, Heide, and Bell 2014) linking the notions of clustering and governance (shared ownership and franchisor vs. franchisee ownership). We propose that shared ownership influences perceptions of intrabrand competition, which in turn affects the motivation of proximal outlets to share knowledge with the focal outlet. We further argue that the costs and benefits of clustering vary for franchisorand franchisee-owned focal outlets because they differ in their relative vulnerability to intrabrand competition as well as in the operational leeway available to them to benefit from knowledge sharing. Ours is the first study, to the best of our understanding, to unravel the complex interplay among geographic proximity, individual outlets’ evolving experience, and their governance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the sections that follow, we first develop the theoretical underpinnings of our conceptual framework and discuss the individual hypotheses linking clustering to outlet-level sales performance, as well as the moderating effects of the governance context. We then describe the research method, results, and their implications. We conclude with the limitations of our study and possible directions for further research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/79n1.jpg" alt="79n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 1 Selected Empirical Research on the Impact of Proximity"><em>TABLE: TABLE 1 Selected Empirical Research on the Impact of Proximity</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Study</th><th valign="top">Context</th><th valign="top">Knowledge Sharing vs. Intrabrand Competition Considered</th><th valign="top">Governance-Induced Effects Considered</th><th valign="top">Outlet-Level Clustering Considered</th><th valign="top">Location’s Financial Performance Considered</th><th valign="top">Key Findings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Ingram and Baum (1997)</td><td valign="top">Hotels in Manhattan</td><td valign="top">Knowledge sharing</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Chain-affiliated hotels are less likely to survive when the chain operates more units there.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Kalnins and Mayer (2004)</td><td valign="top">Pizza restaurants in Texas</td><td valign="top">Knowledge sharing</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Multiunit owners benefit from local congenital experience.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lu and Wedig (2013)</td><td valign="top">For-profit nursing home chains in the United States</td><td valign="top">Other (monitoring cost)</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Clustered nursing homes achieve higher quality from close monitoring.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Brickley and Dark (1987)</td><td valign="top">Franchise companies in multiple industries in the United States</td><td valign="top">Other (monitoring cost)</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Company-owned units are located closer to monitoring headquarters.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Kalnins (2004)</td><td valign="top">Franchised and company-owned lodging establishments in Texas</td><td valign="top">Intrabrand competition</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">New same-brand franchised outlets cannibalize incumbents’ revenues.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ganesan, Malter, and Rindfleisch (2005)</td><td valign="top">Firms in the U.S. optics industry</td><td valign="top">Knowledge sharing</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Firms located in close proximity engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this has little effect on acquiring new productenhancing knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar (2012)</td><td valign="top">A franchised chain of fast-food restaurants in a large U.S. metropolitan area</td><td valign="top">Intrabrand competition</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Sales cannibalization increases as the distance between stores decreases.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Perryman and Combs (2012)</td><td valign="top">Fast-food/quick-service establishments in Florida</td><td valign="top">Other (monitoring cost)</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Multioutlet franchising is costefficient.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top">A large U.S.-based automotive service franchise system</td><td valign="top">Both</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">The impact of clustering of samebrand outlets on sales is contingent on outlets’ experience and the governance context.</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><a id="AN0127019662-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019662-3" title="Conceptual Background">Conceptual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1 displays our proposed conceptual framework. Building on the well-established literature on organizational learning (Argyris and Schön 1978; Cyert and March 1963; Huber 1991; Sinkula 1994; Slater and Narver 1995), we acknowledge the benefits of clustering same-brand outlets in terms of their potential for greater learning, interaction, and knowledge sharing due to their shared brand (Ho and Ganesan 2013; Lu and Wedig 2013; Tracey, Heide, and Bell 2014). We also recognize the peril posed in the intrabrand competition effects of clustering same-brand outlets (Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012). Outlets clustered with one another are more likely to compete for the same set of customers and therefore cannibalize sales (Davis 2006; Kalnins 2004). Competing outlets are hence likely to protect knowledge and to be less amenable to sharing useful information with one another (Hansen, Mors, and Løvås 2005; Tsai 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our hypotheses address this fundamental tension between knowledge sharing and intrabrand competition and suggest when one perspective might dominate the other. We argue that the governance context (shared ownership and franchisor vs. franchisee ownership) affects the clustering–performance relationship. Specifically, the extent to which proximal outlets share ownership influences outlet owners’ perceptions of intrabrand competition, in turn affecting the motivation of proximal outlets to share their knowledge with the focal outlet (Argote and Darr 2000). Furthermore, we posit that the costs and benefits of clustering vary for the franchisor- versus franchisee-owned focal outlet. We also recognize the key role of the operating experience of the clustered outlets in determining their ability to absorb and share knowledge.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Knowledge Sharing Effect</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on the work of Cyert and March (1963), Sinkula (1994, p. 35) defines organizational learning as “a process by which organizations … learn through interaction with their environments.” Such learning develops “new knowledge or insights that have the potential to influence behavior” (Slater and Narver 1995, p. 63) and comprises “technical skills, product knowledge, manufacturing processes” (Ho and Ganesan 2013, p. 93), “task information, knowhow, and feedback regarding a product or procedure” (Cummings 2004, p. 352), as well as information about the market (De Luca and Atuahene-Gima 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Knowledge3 can be explicit or tacit (Ho and Ganesan 2013; Kalnins and Mayer 2004), and it derives directly from the focal outlet’s operating experience and/or indirectly from other outlets’ experiences (Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011; Bradach 1997) on an ongoing basis (Baum and Ingram 1998; Zander and Kogut 1995). Learning from others’ experiences may take place through contact learning (i.e., transmission of routines through personal and formal relationships) or mimetic learning (i.e., imitating or vicarious learning of routines from other outlets) (Baum and Ingram 1998; Miner and Haunschild 1995). This idea of mimetic learning is also reflected in the notion of isomorphism, espoused by institutional theory (Baum and Ingram 1998), wherein organizations widely imitate each other and their behavior, embedded within personal and interconnected organizational relationships, is likely to be similar to and draw from relevant other firms in their operating environment. This research focuses on same-brand clustered outlets sharing knowledge with one another.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To elicit the knowledge sharing effect of clustering, we rely on the well-established motivation–opportunity–ability framework (Argote, McEvily, and Reagans 2003; MacInnis, Moorman, and Jaworski 1991) to inform our hypotheses. The opportunity for knowledge sharing exists to the extent that outlets have occasion to share knowledge with each other. We suggest that greater clustering affords operators of proximal outlets the opportunity to observe, meet, and share knowledge with one another with greater ease (Ganesan, Malter, and Rindfleisch 2005) and the focal outlet greater opportunities to acquire knowledge from proximal same-brand outlets. Such opportunities may or may not be realized, however, depending on (<a id="bib1up

We consider the proximal outlets’ motivation to share knowledge with the focal outlet. Why might franchisee-owned outlets be motivated to share knowledge with other franchisee-owned outlets? Our review of the literature suggests that franchisee-owned outlets do so, even if separately owned and operated, for at least two reasons. First, proximally located same-brand outlets are likely to share similar problems and experiences associated with their local markets (Darr and Kurtzberg 2000). These experiences give same-brand outlets similar frames of reference that should ease and encourage information sharing (Huber 1991). Second, proximally located same-brand outlets face similar competition (i.e., out-groups) and therefore identify more with their in-group (i.e., same-brand outlets) (Bhattacharya and Sen 2003). Such identification leads in-group members to be at least moderately motivated to share knowledge with other same-brand outlets (Ho and Ganesan 2013).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Though a necessary condition, the motivation to share knowledge is not sufficient for successful knowledge sharing; also required is the ability to share knowledge, or the extent to which proximal outlets have relevant skills and information to share with a focal outlet. More mature outlets are more likely to have accumulated a greater amount of experience than newer, less-established outlets (Huber 1991). This greater depth of experience is reflected in stronger organizational routines and operating procedures and deeper repositories of knowledge regarding their appropriate application (Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011). Thus, the more mature proximal outlets are, the greater their ability to share knowledge with a focal outlet.4</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ability to absorb knowledge. The ability to absorb knowledge is the extent to which a focal outlet has the capacity to incorporate information from proximal same-brand outlets. As the focal outlet gains experience, its ability to value, assimilate, and apply new knowledge—that is, its absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990)—also increases (Penrose 1959). With an increase in its absorptive capacity, the focal outlet is more likely to value and use knowledge available from its proximal same-brand outlets and to realize higher levels of productivity and performance (Chen, Lin, and Chang 2009).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Intrabrand Competition Effect</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Coincident with potential knowledge sharing benefits are the costs of intrabrand competition in terms of sales cannibalization (Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012) and knowledge protection (Tsai 2002). Prior research provides evidence of increased competition between proximal same-brand outlets (Kalnins 2003, 2004; Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012). These outlets sell the same products and share the same set of customers in close proximity to each other, with little product or service differentiation (Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012); therefore, they are viewed as close substitutes by customers (Kalnins 2003). The perceived substitutability of same-brand outlets makes travel costs incurred by customers more salient (Davis 2006; Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012), resulting in the sales cannibalization of existing outlets (Kalnins 2004). Thus, proximally located same-brand outlets are likely to compete more fiercely with each other than with outlets located farther away.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Proximal outlets with greater concerns of intrabrand competition are likely to be more guarded and less forthcoming with respect to sharing relevant and useful knowledge with the focal outlet (Hansen, Mors, and Løvås 2005; Tsai 2002). Owners of proximal same-brand outlets are more likely to perceive their sharing of knowledge with the focal outlet as weakening their own performance and thus are more likely to hide what they know or divulge only some of their useful knowledge to the focal outlet (Hansen, Mors, and Løvås 2005). This increases the focal outlet’s cost in the pursuit of knowledge and adversely affects its subsequent performance (Hansen, Mors, and Løvås 2005).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/84n1.jpg" alt="84n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 2 Underlying Logic of Hypotheses"><em>TABLE: TABLE 2 Underlying Logic of Hypotheses</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top" colspan="8">A: Logic for Knowledge Sharing and Intrabrand Competition Effects</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top" colspan="4">Knowledge Sharing Logic</th><th valign="top" colspan="2">Intrabrand Competition Logic</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">Condition</th><th valign="top">Cluster Type</th><th valign="top">Proximal Outlets’ Motivation to Share Knowledge with Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Focal Outlet’s Ability to Absorb Knowledge from Proximal Outlets</th><th valign="top">Proximal Outlets’ Ability to Share Knowledge with Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Knowledge Shared with the Focal Outlet (Based on Columns 3, 4, and 5)</th><th valign="top">Intrabrand Competition Faced by the Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Specific Hypotheses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Condition 1: new focal outlet</td><td valign="top">CL(NN), CL(NM)</td><td valign="top">Moderate at best, due to same-chain affiliation</td><td valign="top">Low, due to lesser absorptive capacity of new focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(NM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">Low, due to lesser absorptive capacity of new focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(NM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">H1a, H1b</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Condition 2: mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">CL(MM), CL(MN)</td><td valign="top">Moderate at best, due to same-chain affiliation</td><td valign="top">High, due to greater absorptive capacity of mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(MM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(MM), due to mature proximal outlets and higher absorptive capacity of mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(MM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">H2</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top" colspan="8">B: Moderating Effect of Shared Ownership</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top">&nbsp;</th><th valign="top" colspan="4">Knowledge Sharing Logic</th><th valign="top" colspan="2">Intrabrand Competition Logic</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">Condition</th><th valign="top">Cluster Type</th><th valign="top">Proximal Outlets’ Motivation to Share Knowledge with Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Focal Outlet’s Ability to Absorb Knowledge from Proximal Outlets</th><th valign="top">Proximal Outlets’ Ability to Share Knowledge with Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Knowledge Shared with the Focal Outlet (Based on Columns 3, 4, and 5)</th><th valign="top">Intrabrand Competition Faced by the Focal Outlet</th><th valign="top">Specific Hypotheses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Condition 3: new focal outlet</td><td valign="top">CL(NN), CL(NM)</td><td valign="top">High, due to shared ownership</td><td valign="top">Low, due to lesser absorptive capacity of new focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(NM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(NM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">Low, due to shared ownership</td><td valign="top">H3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Condition 4: mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">CL(MM), CL(MN)</td><td valign="top">High, due to shared ownership</td><td valign="top">High, due to greater absorptive capacity of mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(MM), due to mature proximal outlets</td><td valign="top">Higher in CL(MM), due to mature proximal outlets and higher absorptive capacity of mature focal outlet</td><td valign="top">Low, due to shared ownership</td><td valign="top">H4</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Governance Context as Moderator</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our conceptual framework also identifies two relevant governance characteristics that help determine whether knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition dominates: shared ownership and franchisor versus franchisee ownership. We expect the shared ownership of clustered outlets (i.e., multiunit operations) to reduce the perceptions of intrabrand competition (Kalnins and Lafontaine 2004), thus prompting proximal outlets to be less guarded and more motivated to share knowledge with the focal outlet (Argote and Darr 2000; Darr, Argote, and Epple 1995; Ingram and Baum 2001). Building on recent theoretical developments linking governance characteristics to geographic clusters (Bell, Tracey, and Heide 2009; Tracey, Heide, and Bell 2014), we also identify franchisor versus franchisee ownership of the focal outlet as a critical “shifter” (Shane 2001) of the knowledge–competition boundary effects. We expect franchisees to experience higher costs of intrabrand competition, due to greater proximity (Kalnins 2004), and lower benefits of knowledge sharing, due to contractual constraints (Kashyap, Antia, and Frazier 2012), than their franchisor-owned counterparts.</p><a id="AN0127019662-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0127019662-5" title="Hypotheses">Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Clustering Effects</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 2 details the underlying logic for H1–H4. We suggest that clustering provides the opportunity for a focal outlet to learn from same-brand proximal outlets but also poses a potential risk of intrabrand competition. Thus, our arguments focus on the interplay of conditions that likely make the knowledge sharing or intrabrand competition more salient for the clustered outlets. As Table 2 shows, we hypothesize that the knowledge shared with the focal outlet is a function of the proximal outlets’ motivation and ability to share knowledge and the focal outlet’s ability to absorb the knowledge shared (see columns 3, 4, and 5 in Table 2); however, their perceptions of intrabrand competition are likely to be influenced significantly by their governance. In what follows, we first take the perspective of a newly established focal outlet, followed by that of a mature focal outlet. For both new and mature focal outlets, we predict the impact of their clustering with other new and mature same-brand outlets on their performance.5</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perspective of a new focal outlet. Consider Condition 1: a newly established focal outlet clustered with same-brand outlets that may be new (N) or mature (M), forming clusters CL(NN) and CL(NM), respectively.6 Given their relative inexperience, newly established outlets possess less knowledge of their own (Penrose 1959) and are less practiced and capable of performing the activities in which they are engaged (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). Moreover, newly established outlets do not know local market conditions and competitors as well as their mature counterparts, which negatively affects their ability to use the knowledge shared by their proximal outlets. Thus, we expect a new focal outlet to be more likely to succumb to the intrabrand competition effect of clustering rather than gain from its knowledge sharing potential, regardless of whether the proximal outlets are able (i.e., they are mature) or motivated (i.e., their intrabrand competition concerns are mitigated) to share their knowledge.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1a: The greater the clustering of a new focal outlet with other same-brand outlets, the weaker its performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we argue that the intrabrand competition experienced by the new focal outlet is greater when the proximal same-brand outlets are mature (i.e., the CL(NM) relative to the CL(NN) cluster). Mature proximal outlets have more market knowledge, such as product and process knowledge (Ho and Ganesan 2013), customer knowledge (Cummings 2004), and external environment knowledge (De Luca and Atuahene-Gima 2007), which gives them a greater ability to compete at an advantage against the newly established focal outlets. We therefore expect that new focal outlets’ performance will be more negative when the outlets are clustered with mature outlets (i.e., CL(NM)) than when they are clustered with new outlets (i.e., CL(NN)).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1b: New focal outlets clustered with mature same-brand outlets perform worse than those clustered with new same-brand outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perspective of a mature focal outlet. Consider Condition 2 in Table 2, in which a mature (M) focal outlet is clustered with mature (M) or new (N) outlets of the same brand, forming clusters CL(MM) and CL(MN), respectively. Given its own accumulated experience, a mature focal outlet is likely to have a greater ability to absorb any knowledge shared by its proximal outlets than a new focal outlet. This is because a mature focal outlet has greater accumulated experience and correspondingly higher absorptive capacity than its newly established counterparts (Zahra and George 2002). It would therefore benefit from being clustered with other mature outlets of the same brand, which have the ability to share knowledge due to their greater repository of relevant knowledge (Kalnins and Mayer 2004). This knowledge benefit to the mature outlet is limited when the outlet is clustered with newly established outlets, which likely possess less relevant knowledge to share (Kalnins and Mayer 2004). From a knowledge sharing perspective, the mature focal outlet is better served when clustered with other mature outlets rather than with newly established outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, from an intrabrand competitive threat perspective, the opposite inference is likely to prevail—that is, the mature focal outlet is better served when clustered with newly established outlets rather than mature outlets. The reason lies in the greater market knowledge of the mature focal outlet, which confers a competitive advantage over the newly established proximal outlets. As proximal outlets’ experience increases with maturity, however, this knowledge-based competitive advantage dissipates and the focal outlet experiences a higher level of intrabrand competition from mature proximal outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, when the mature focal outlet is clustered with mature outlets, it benefits from knowledge sharing; this benefit, however, is balanced by the greater competitive threat posed by the mature proximal outlets due to their greater experience. In contrast, when the mature focal outlet is clustered with new outlets, it loses the knowledge sharing benefit, which is balanced by the lower competitive threat posed by the outlets’ newness. We therefore hypothesize no significant difference in performance between mature focal outlets clustered with mature or new outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H2: The greater clustering of a mature focal outlet with other mature or new same-brand outlets neither helps nor hinders the outlet’s performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><span class="centered"><img class="rs_skip" src="./EBSCOhost2011-2020_files/87n1.jpg" alt="87n1.jpg" title="TABLE: TABLE 3 Variables and Data Sources"><em>TABLE: TABLE 3 Variables and Data Sources</em></span></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> </p><div class="table-size-normal table-border"><table border="1"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Construct</th><th valign="top">Measured Variable</th><th valign="top">Notation</th><th valign="top">Data Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Clustering</td><td valign="top"><p>Proximity of a new focal outlet i with other same-brand new outlets j in year t</p><p>Proximity of a new focal outlet i with same-brand mature outlets j in year t</p><p>Proximity of a mature focal outlet i with other same-brand mature outlets j in year t</p><p>Proximity of a mature focal outlet i with same-brand new outlets j in year t</p></td><td valign="top"><p>CLit(NN)</p><p>CLit(NM)</p><p>CLit(MM)</p><p>CLit(MN)</p></td><td valign="top">Computed using ArcGIS 10.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Shared ownership</td><td valign="top">Shared ownership of a focal outlet i with other same-brand outlets j within a cluster in year t</td><td valign="top">SOit</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Franchisor versus franchisee ownership</td><td valign="top">Dichotomous variable that equals 1 when a focal outlet i is franchisee owned and 0 if franchisor owned</td><td valign="top">FFOi</td><td valign="top">Internal company records</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sales performance</td><td valign="top">Sales revenue of a focal outlet i in year t</td><td valign="top">SRit</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" colspan="4">Control Variables</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cluster size</td><td valign="top">Number of outlets within 25-mile radius of a focal outlet i in year t</td><td valign="top">CSit</td><td valign="top">Computed using ArcGIS 10.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mean age of clustered outlets</td><td valign="top">Mean age of proximal outlets within 25-mile radius of a focal outlet i in year t</td><td valign="top">APit</td><td valign="top">Internal company records</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Firm size</td><td valign="top">Total number of outlets in year t</td><td valign="top">FSt</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Royalty rate</td><td valign="top">The ongoing payment as a percentage of sales in year t</td><td valign="top">RRt</td><td valign="top">Franchise disclosure documents</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Interbrand competition</td><td valign="top">Number of outlets of competitor brands located in county k in year t</td><td valign="top">IBCkt</td><td valign="top">U.S. Census Bureau</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Area (square miles)</td><td valign="top">Area of county k</td><td valign="top">ARk</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Population (millions)</td><td valign="top">Population of county k in year t</td><td valign="top">POPkt</td><td valign="top">Bureau of Economic Analysis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Income (millions)</td><td valign="top">Income per capita of county k in year t</td><td valign="top">INkt</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moderating Effects of Shared Ownership</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus far, our hypotheses have focused on the anticipated main effects of clustering on the focal outlet’s performance. To these, we now add the potential moderating effects of shared ownership of the focal and proximal outlets (see Table 2, Panel B). We define “shared ownership” as the extent to which outlets in the cluster are owned by the same operator as that of the focal outlet. For franchisee-owned focal outlets, this comprises only the proximal outlets owned by the same focal franchisee. When the focal outlet is franchisor owned, this comprises only the franchisor-owned outlets within that cluster.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shared ownership affects the clustering–performance relationship by influencing the perceptions of intrabrand competition (Ingram and Baum 2001; Kalnins and Lafontaine 2004), which in turn affects the motivation of proximal outlets to share knowledge with the focal outlet (Argote and Darr 2000; Darr and Kurtzberg 2000). Unlike outlets that do not share a common owner, outlets operating under shared ownership are likely to have greater norms of reciprocity, a common language system, and incentives to share knowledge, all of which enhance the motivation of the clustered outlets to share knowledge (Darr, Argote, and Epple 1995).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, shared ownership creates even more opportunities for outlets to share knowledge through multiple means. Indeed, Darr, Argote, and Epple (1995) note that outlets operating under shared ownership have more regular communication with one another and more interpersonal ties than those not sharing common ownership. Moreover, shared ownership creates more opportunities to share knowledge through contact learning (in addition to mimetic learning), in which knowledge is shared through personal and formal relationships (Baum and Ingram 1998; Miner and Haunschild 1995). We now discuss how shared ownership might affect the performance implications of clustering for a newly established focal outlet and a mature focal outlet.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perspective of a new focal outlet. As proposed in H1b, we expect a new focal outlet clustered with mature outlets to underperform relative to a new focal outlet clustered with newly established outlets. We attribute this to the double jeopardy of a new focal outlet’s inability to absorb knowledge from proximal outlets and a higher level of intrabrand competition from more mature and capable proximal outlets. We expect shared ownership to significantly attenuate both these adverse effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consider Condition 3 in Table 2, in which a new (N) focal outlet is clustered with new (N) or mature (M) same-brand outlets sharing common ownership and forming clusters CL(NN) and CL(NM), respectively. As the extent of shared ownership between a focal outlet and its proximal outlets increases, the proximal outlets’ motivation to share knowledge with the focal outlet increases by lowering perceptions of intrabrand competition (Argote, McEvily, and Reagans 2003; Ingram and Baum 2001; Kalnins and Lafontaine 2004). The common owner’s objective of ensuring successful operations across his or her multiple outlets (Tsai and Ghoshal 1998) results in stronger ties and greater trust and reciprocity among the shared ownership outlets (Larson 1992; Tsai 2002). Such strong ties brought about by shared ownership blur the perceptions of intrabrand competition and foster greater knowledge sharing among commonly owned outlets (Tsai and Ghoshal 1998).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although newly established focal outlets are less able to value, assimilate, and apply new knowledge (i.e., they have lower absorptive capacity), shared ownership creates more opportunities to learn by contact rather than solely relying on mimetic learning (Darr, Argote, and Epple 1995). Thus, when operating under shared ownership, newly established focal outlets have additional ways to learn organizational routines and operating procedures that are less available (or not available at all) to outlets that do not share common ownership.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The final element to consider when assessing the moderating effect of common ownership is the proximal outlets’ ability to share knowledge. As discussed previously, experience is a significant source of operating knowledge (Kalnins and Mayer 2004). Newly established proximal outlets are likely to have less useful and relevant knowledge to share with the focal outlet. Mature proximal outlets, alternatively, are more likely to have a higher level of knowledge to share. Moreover, despite the difficulties new outlets face in absorbing new knowledge, mature proximal outlets under common ownership are also motivated to work with newly established outlets to find ways to instill knowledge in them. The knowledge benefit accruing to the focal outlet is likely to supersede the intrabrand competition–related concern, and this knowledge benefit is likely to be higher for focal outlets clustered with commonly owned mature outlets rather than newly established ones.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3: As the extent of shared ownership increases, new focal outlets clustered with mature outlets perform better than those clustered with new outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perspective of a mature focal outlet. As we propose in H2, a mature focal outlet has more (less) knowledge to gain from other mature (new) proximal outlets but also faces more (less) intrabrand competition from these more (less) experienced outlets. The positive (knowledge sharing) and adverse (intrabrand competition) effects of clustering should counter each other, resulting in no likely differences in performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Now consider Condition 4 in Table 2, in which a mature (M) focal outlet is clustered with mature (M) or new (N) outlets of the same brand sharing common ownership, forming clusters CL(MM) and CL(MN), respectively. As the extent of shared ownership of the clustered outlets increases, concerns about intrabrand competition are significantly mitigated (Argote, McEvily, and Reagans 2003; Ingram and Baum 2001). The proximal outlets’ knowledge protection imperative correspondingly declines (Kalnins and Lafontaine 2004), leading to an increased motivation to share knowledge with the focal outlet (Darr, Argote, and Epple 1995; Ingram and Baum 2001). In turn, the means of knowledge sharing also changes; that is, rather than relying solely on observation of the proximal outlets, the focal outlet also learns from them through direct contact (Baum and Ingram 1998; Miner and Haunschild 1995). This additional modality of learning from proximal others confers a higher ability on the mature focal outlet to learn, compared with the situation in which the extent of shared ownership is lower.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mature focal outlets possess greater accumulated experience and a correspondingly higher level of absorptive capacity (Zahra and George 2002). When they are clustered with commonly owned mature outlets that are motivated and able to share their knowledge, the knowledge benefits accruing to the mature focal outlets dominate the significantly lower intrabrand competition effects. This knowledge sharing–related benefit is likely to be reduced when the proximal outlets are newly established; notwithstanding their higher motivation to share knowledge, newly established outlets possess less knowledge that might benefit the mature focal outlet. Thus, an increase in the extent of shared ownership likely brings about greater knowledge gains for mature focal outlets clustered with mature rather than newly established outlets. This suggests the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H4: As the extent of shared ownership increases, mature focal outlets clustered with mature outlets perform better than those clustered with new outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moderating Effects of Franchisor Versus Franchisee Ownership</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We draw from the rich body of franchising research on the drivers (Brickley and Dark 1987; Perryman and Combs 2012) and consequences (Kalnins 2004) of outlet ownership to posit moderation of the previously hypothesized clustering effects, depending on whether the focal outlet is franchisor- or franchisee-owned. Compared with franchisor-owned outlets, we suggest that franchisee-owned outlets are more vulnerable to intrabrand competition and benefit less from the knowledge sharing opportunity conferred by proximal same-brand outlets. The increased costs for franchisees and the reduced knowledge benefits to them should result in franchisorowned outlets outperforming their franchisee-owned counterparts across the clustering scenarios we assess.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Franchisee-owned outlets are more likely than franchisorowned outlets to bear the brunt of intrabrand competition due to proximity. Because franchisees’ royalty payments are tied to their revenue (Lafontaine 1992), franchisors are incentivized to open new franchisee-owned outlets, even if they are located close to existing franchisee-owned outlets (Kalnins 2004). In contrast, the franchisor is likely to be more strategic in ensuring that revenues at existing franchisor-owned outlets will not decrease when new outlets are opened (Kalnins 2004). This implies that franchisee-owned outlets are more likely to face competition from other proximal same-brand outlets. Indeed, Kalnins (2004) finds evidence of such a higher likelihood of franchisees facing intrabrand competition. The adverse consequences of intrabrand competition are thus likely to be higher for franchisee-owned outlets than their franchisor-owned counterparts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we expect franchisees to benefit less from the proximity-conferred learning and knowledge sharing opportunity than franchisor-owned outlets. Recall that the benefits of learning are realized when, on the basis of learning, the focal outlet undertakes different, improved actions and routines (Huber 1991). Franchise systems, by their very design, emphasize uniformity over innovation. To ensure the former, franchisors rely on ironclad contractual agreements and uniformity-ensuring constraints (Kashyap, Antia, and Frazier 2012) that reduce the leeway available to franchisees to make significant changes in response to the additional know-how they are able to glean from their proximal same-brand outlets. Thus, even if a focal franchisee has the opportunity to learn by clustering with same-brand outlets, has proximal outlets that are motivated and have the ability to share knowledge with it, and also has the absorptive capacity to use the knowledge shared, it may not be able to implement improved actions or routines because of contractual constraints.</p><p class="body-paragraph"

The participating firm provided information on the date of establishment, specific location (street address), and the ownership of each outlet (franchisor or franchisee owned), from system inception in 1977 to its 988th outlet in 2012. In addition, top management shared outlet-level sales performance information on an annual basis from 2004 to 2012. We supplemented these data with various firm- and market-specific variables at the county level, such as royalty rate, interbrand competition, population, per capita income, and area from franchise disclosure documents, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Table 3 displays the complete list of variables used in this study and their data sources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Unit of Analysis and Measures</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our unit of analysis is the individual outlet i (i = 1, …, 988), observed t years since its inception (t = 0, …, 35). Our objective is to relate the clustering of outlets to their corresponding sales performance over time. Table 4 provides the descriptive statistics for all the variables and the pairwise correlations among them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Outlet performance. Our focal dependent variable, outlet-level performance, is reflected in the annual sales revenue (SRit), natural log–transformed, realized by outlet i in year t. The sales revenue of the individual outlet serves as the basis for franchisees’ royalty payments (i.e., royalties are calculated as a percentage of sales) and are therefore of great importance to both franchisees and franchisors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Cluster types. We assessed the extent to which each outlet i was part of a cluster of same-brand outlets at time t by computing the local Moran’s I index (Anselin 1995) using ArcGIS 10.3.

The local Moran’s I identifies outlets with low (i.e., younger) and high (older) attribute values by using the normal distribution of outlet age, categorizing each as new and mature, respectively. Thus, we are able to infer not only the strength of clustering at the individual outlet level but also the four archetypal cluster types of theoretical relevance based on age: CLit(NN), when a new focal outlet i is clustered with other new outlets at time t; CLit(NM), when a new focal outlet i is clustered with mature outlets at time t; CLit(MM), when a mature focal outlet i is clustered with other mature outlets at time t; and CLit(MN), when a mature focal outlet i is clustered with new outlets at time t. Prior studies in marketing have used Moran’s I index to measure spatial dependence of variables (e.g., Mittal, Kamakura, and Govind 2004). The Web Appendix provides additional details on the local Moran’s I computation and examples from our data of each of the four prototypical clustering types.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shared ownership. Consistent with Lu and Wedig (2013), we define clustering within a 25-mile radius of the focal outlet and measure shared ownership of clustered outlets (SOit) as the count of proximal outlets j within this 25-mile radius of the focal outlet i at time t. For franchisee-owned focal outlets, this measure counts only the proximal outlets that are owned by the same focal franchisee (i.e., multiunit franchisees). For franchisor-owned focal outlets, the count includes only franchisor-owned outlets within a 25-mile radius of the focal outlet.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Franchisor versus franchisee ownership. We operationalize franchisor versus franchisee ownership (FFOi) as a dichotomous variable that takes a value of 1 when an outlet i is franchisee-owned and 0 when franchisor-owned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Control variables. We incorporate several control variables that we expect to have an impact on the individual outlet’s sales performance over and above our hypothesized variables. We measure cluster size (CSit) as the number of same-brand outlets within a 25-mile radius of a focal outlet. We also include the mean age of outlets in a 25-mile radius of the focal outlet, incorporating its quadratic term as well to control for the possibility of diminishing returns to experience. We control for franchise system size (FSt), or the total number of outlets in operation in year t, and royalty rate (RRt), or the ongoing payment as a percentage of sales that franchisees must pay the franchisor for use of the trademark and other support. System size reflects overall access of the outlet to resources that could affect performance; royalties incentivize franchisor investments in the brand, thereby boosting franchisee sales and making the franchise more attractive to franchisees.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also control for market-specific effects on outlet sales performance. The most fine-grained market data we are able to collect are at the U.S. county level, k (k = 1, …, 270). We include interbrand competition (IBCkt), or the total number of outlets of other competing brands included in the five-digit North American Industry Classification System code corresponding to the sector in which the franchise system operates, located in county k in year t. We also include the population (POPkt) of county k in year t, the income per capita (INkt) in county k in year t, and the area of the county (ARk) in square miles. Finally, we control for unobserved heterogeneity by including year-specific fixed effects for the t years in our data set.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Model Specification</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although we were able to obtain data pertaining to individual outlet locations from the inception of the franchise system in 1977, corresponding outlet sales data are available only from 2004 and are missing for some outlets. To account for potential biased parameter estimates due to sales data not being missing at random, we correct for selection bias by specifying a Heckman (1976) selection model in the first stage of the analysis and including the lambda vector thus obtained in the second stage. This second-stage (substantive) equation investigates the interplay of clustering, shared ownership, franchisor versus franchisee ownership of the focal outlet, and their impact on outlet sales performance, while accounting for potential endogeneity of the regressors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stage 1: correction for sample selection bias. We specify our selection equation as a probit model as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">where</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">INCLUDEit = outlet i’s availability of sales information at time t,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">OAit = age of outlet i at time t,</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">FEi = franchisee-owned as a binary variable (franchisee-owned = 1, 0 otherwise),</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">YRt = specific years as dummy variables, with 2004 as the excluded base year, and</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">eit ~ N(m1, s2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From this equation, we obtain and store the inverse Mills ratio (i.e., lambda) vector for subsequent inclusion in the second stage of analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stage 2: substantive equation estimation. In the second stage, we relate each outlet’s clustering, shared ownership, and franchisor versus franchisee ownership to its annual sales performance. Our model specification approach in this stage is informed by the need to account for the potential endogeneity of regressors—clustering (CLit(NN), CLit(NM), CLit(MM), and CLit(MN)), shared ownership (SOit), and franchisor versus franchisee ownership (FFOi). The clustering-related regressors and shared ownership are time varying, whereas franchisor versus franchisee ownership is time invariant. Durbin–Wu– Hausman tests of these variables yielded significant evidence of endogeneity. We therefore specified an endogeneity-correcting regression equation. We also treat the interactions of clustering with shared ownership and with franchisor versus franchisee ownership as endogenous.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We use the Hausman–Taylor instrumental variables (HTIV) regression approach to account for endogenous regressors (for estimation details and checks of its appropriateness, see the Web Appendix).

Base year = 2004.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Model-free evidence. As Table 4 shows, the clustering of a new focal outlet with other outlets is significantly and negatively correlated with outlet sales (r(CLit(NN)) = –.05, r(CLit(NM)) = –.04, both p &lt; .01), as we expected. In comparison, the clustering of mature outlets is significantly and positively correlated with outlet sales when the clustered outlets are mature (r(CLit(MM)) = .10, p &lt; .01) and negatively correlated when the clustered outlets are new (r(CLit(MN)) = –.04, p &lt; .01). The clustering of new focal outlets is clearly associated with less favorable sales performance than the clustering of mature focal outlets. Thus, these results provide initial model-free evidence for our baseline hypotheses (H1 and H2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Heckman selection model. The overall model is significant (Wald c2 = 10.58, p &lt; .01), and we find clear evidence of selection with respect to sales information availability (l = –1.15, p &lt; .01). We find that mature outlets (b1 = .05, p &lt; .01) are more likely to provide sales information than newoutlets, while franchisee-owned outlets (b2 = –.24, p &lt; .01) are less likely to provide sales information than franchisorowned outlets. We also find that relative to the base year of 2004, there is greater availability of outlet sales information in subsequent years.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The HTIV estimation. Table 5 displays the results of the HTIV estimation. The overall model is significant (Wald c2 = 11,096.91, p &lt; .01), suggesting that the hypothesized predictors of outlet-level sales performance have significant explanatory power. The main effect of clustering on the focal outlets’ sales performance is significant and negative when new focal outlets are clustered with new outlets (h1 = –.03, p &lt; .01) and with mature outlets (h2 = –.10, p &lt; .05) of the same brand. We therefore find support for H1a. However, we find no significant sales performance differences between new focal outlets being clustered with new or mature outlets of the same brand (c2 = 2.49, n.s.); therefore, H1b is not supported. As hypothesized, we find no impact of clustering of mature focal outlets with other mature (h3 = .01, n.s.) or new (h4 = .04, n.s.) outlets on the focal outlets’ sales performance. Thus, we find support for H2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also find support for H3, which predicted that new focal outlets would perform better when clustered with mature (h8 = .01, p &lt; .05) rather than new (h7 = –.01, p &lt; .01) outlets that are under shared ownership. According to H4, as the extent of shared ownership increases, mature focal outlets gain sales when clustered with mature proximal outlets (h9 = .00, p &lt; .01) and lose sales when clustered with new proximal outlets (h10 = –.02, p &lt; .01). Thus, H4 is supported.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5 predicted that franchisee-owned outlets would gain less from clustering than franchisor-owned outlets. We find partial support for H5. Specifically, we find that mature franchisee-owned outlets achieve lower sales than their franchisor-owned counterparts when in close proximity to other mature outlets (h12 = –.07, p &lt; .01). However, compared with their franchisor-owned counterparts, the clustering of new franchisee-owned outlets with mature outlets results in significant gains to sales performance (h11 = .09, p &lt; .05). This runs counter to H5. Furthermore, we find that the clustering of mature franchisee-owned outlets with new outlets does not significantly differ from that of their franchisor-owned counterparts (h13 = –.14, n.s.). Finally, the franchise system had no instances of new franchisor-owned outlets clustering with other new outlets; the lack of a contrast precludes the ability to test their relationship. Overall, we find that franchisor versus franchisee ownership affects the clustering–performance relationship for both new and mature focal outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the control variables, we find that firm size (h17 = .00, p &lt; .01) significantly and positively affects outlet-level sales. Cluster size (h14 = –.10, p &lt; .01) and royalty rate (h18 = –.39, p &lt; .01), however, have a significant and negative relationship to outlet-level sales. The mean age of cluster (h15 = –.06, p &lt; .01) is significantly and negatively associated with outlet sales, but with a marginally significant diminishing trend (h16 = .00, p &lt; .10). For market-specific control variables, greater population (h20 = .20, p &lt; .01) and per capita income (h21 = 1.04, p &lt; .01) significantly and positively increase outlet-level sales, while interbrand competition (h19 = .00, p &lt; .10) partially and positively affects outlet-level sales. Market area (h22 = –.05, n.s.) does not significantly affect outlet-level sales. Finally, we find significant year-specific effects on outlet-level sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Post Hoc Analysis of Significant Interactions</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For a better understanding of the moderating impact of shared ownership and franchisor versus franchisee ownership on the clustering and outlet-level sales relationship, we conducted an analysis of simple slopes for all significant interactions (Aiken and West 1991). Figure 2, Panel A, suggests that new focal outlets that are highly clustered with other new sharedownership outlets do lose more sales, relative to their counterparts that are not highly clustered (simple slope of CLit(NN) for new focal outlets = –.20, p &lt; .01). In marked contrast, Panel B suggests that new focal outlets’ sales are not significantly affected by their clustering with mature outlets under shared ownership (simple slope of CLit(NM) for new focal outlets = .08, n.s.). Panels C and D suggest that mature focal outlets gain sales when clustered with othermature outlets in the presence of shared ownership (simple slope of CLit(MM) for mature focal outlets = .12, p &lt; .01).Mature focal outlets’ sales performance, however, is harmed when focal outlets are clustered with new outlets under shared ownership (simple slope of CLit(MN) for mature focal outlets = –.67, p &lt; .01).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 3, Panel B, suggests that clustering of a new focal outlet with mature outlets harms outlet-level sales when the focal outlet is franchisor-owned (the simple slope of CLit(NM) for franchisor-owned focal outlets = –.10, p &lt; .05). In contrast, franchisee-owned new focal outlets are not significantly hurt or helped by their proximity to mature outlets (the simple slope of CLit(NM) for franchisee-owned focal outlets = –.01, n.s.). Panel B suggests that mature franchisor-owned focal outlets’ clustering with other mature outlets has no significant impact on their sales performance (the simple slope of CLit(MM) for franchisor-owned focal outlets = .01, n.s.). Only franchiseeowned mature focal outlets lose from greater clustering with othermature outlets (the simple slope ofCLit(MM) for franchiseeowned focal outlets = –.06, p &lt; .05).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative Specifications</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We assessed the stability of our findings to alternate estimation approaches, alternate measures of performance, alternative explanations for the effects reported, alternate time-related specifications, and alternative levels of analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative estimator. To test the robustness of our results, we used the fixed-effects approach as an alternative estimator. The fixed-effects estimation results in the dropping of the time-invariant franchisor versus franchisee ownership (FFOi) variable, but it retains all four archetypal clustering types and their interactions with shared ownership and franchisor versus franchisee ownership. All results with respect to the hypothesized effects remain robust.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative measure of performance. We also relied on a different but related measure of outlet performance—sales transaction volume—which we operationalized as the total number of transactions reported by each outlet per year. Our HTIV estimates remain robust to this alternative measure of performance as well.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative explanation for the effects reported. We also explored the possibility that the focal outlet’s sales might be affected not from any knowledge sharing pursuant to clustering but from better franchisor monitoring capabilities as a function of nearby franchisor-owned outlets. To test this alternative explanation, we computed the number of franchisor-owned outlets in the county of location of the focal outlet and included this variable in our model. All the clustering-related effects and their interactions with shared ownership and franchisor versus franchisee ownership remain robust, and the main effect of the additional regressor is nonsignificant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative temporal separation. We based our conceptualization and subsequent model specification approach on the assumption of contemporaneous (immediate, within the same year) effects of clustering on the sales performance of each outlet. We also assessed one- and two-year lagged models of the hypothesized relationships. Our principal findings of the baseline hypotheses and the moderating effects of shared ownership and franchisor versus franchisee ownership persist.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternative level of analysis. Prior research has mostly used clustering as a global or systemwide construct (within the present context, across all 988 outlets of the franchise system) without investigating the type of clustering or with whom a focal outlet is clustered. We therefore specified an alternative model, measuring clustering at the system level and treating it as an endogenous regressor. The HTIV estimation results show that the systemwide clustering of outlets is positively and significantly associated with the individual outlets’ sales. This is consistent with prior research that does not account for the accumulated experience, shared ownership, or franchisor versus franchisee ownership of the clustered outlets (e.g., Lu and Wedig 2013). This result, however, masks the nuances that emerge from a broader consideration of the specific identities of the focal and proximal outlets and provides misleading confi-dence in clustering effects on performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Discussion</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Proximity associated with clustering is a contentious issue for all franchising participants, but it is particularly vexing for franchisees because of sales cannibalization concerns. Our assessment of the impact of clustering suggests that although these concerns are not unfounded, they only apply under certain conditions. Our findings support our contention that physical distance is not the sole determinant of outlet sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Theoretical Implications</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research was motivated by conflicting findings and assertions about the effects of clustering. Importantly, disagreements regarding clustering-attributable performance exist not only across but also within paradigms. Consider, for example, how much at odds the studies reporting positive effects of agglomeration (Chung and Kalnins 2001) are with those warning of significant sales cannibalization (Pancras, Sriram, and Kumar 2012). We observe a similar schism for studies adopting a sociology-informed clustering viewpoint and the knowledge sharing this implies. Whereas Lu and Wedig (2013) report positive performance effects, Ingram and Baum (1997) find evidence of a negative impact of clustering.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our study builds on and extends both streams of work. In particular, we call for a more nuanced consideration of clustering’s impact, one that emphasizes not just the physical distance from specific outlets (“how far”) but also the distance “from whom.” In essence, we argue that the specific identities of the focal outlet and of the same-brand outlets it may cluster with matter. Until now, research on clustering has focused almost exclusively on system-level clustering. In the present context, this amounts to a single “clustering score” representing the extent of clustering across all 988 outlets of the franchise system we assessed. As we have demonstrated, such an aggregate approach indeed yields a positive association between clustering and sales. However, it is only when clustering is unpacked (i.e., particular individual outlets’ clustering with particular other same-brand outlets) that we find evidence of positive and negative cluster-attributable effects. Our research highlights the interplay of knowledge sharing and intrabrand competition in explaining these effects and calls for a more subtle, disaggregated approach to assessing clustering’s impact.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The differential performance accruing to outlets within each of the four archetypal cluster types provides support for our disaggregated approach to assessing clustering effects. We find that newly established outlets suffer sales declines, consistent with their lower absorptive capacity and greater susceptibility to intrabrand competition. In contrast, mature outlets appear to be shielded from the worst effects of intrabrand competition, due to their greater repository of operating knowledge. Perhaps most important, shared ownership of the focal outlet—whether newly established or mature—and the outlets proximal to it appear to ease concerns about intrabrand competition, in turn enhancing the motivation for sharing knowledge and the corresponding performance level of the focal outlet.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also note some results that are contrary to our expectations. We hypothesized that franchisee-owned outlets would perform less well when clustered than their franchisor-owned counterparts. This expectation received support in only one of the three clustering situations we analyzed: when a mature franchisee-owned outlet is clustered with other mature outlets. We observed no such decreased performance for mature franchisee-owned outlets clustered with new outlets; contrary to our hypothesis, newly established franchisee-owned outlets perform better than their franchisor-owned peers when clustered with mature outlets. Though puzzling at first glance, these antithetical findings may be explained by the agency theory– based raison d’être for franchising—namely, the power of incentives, specifically that of residual claims, whereby newly established franchisees exert effort to retain their outlets’ profits after making royalty payments to their franchisor (Brickley and Dark 1987; Brickley, Dark, and Weisbach 1991; Lafontaine 1992). It is likely the incentives on the part of the new franchisee-owned focal outlet and the corresponding motivation and ability to share knowledge on the part of the mature proximal outlets that lead to this positive clustering effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our study has implications for research on knowledge sharing beyond the current franchising context. By elucidating the movement of knowledge between different units/organizations, our research highlights processes that involve both the sharing of knowledge by the knowledge source outlet and the acquisition and application of knowledge by the recipient outlet, thereby allowing us to contribute to the literature on interorganizational knowledge sharing. Relatedly, our research adds to what is known about knowledge sharing in interfirm networks based on spatial and/or psychological proximity, in which knowledge sharing among networked firms depends on the number of connections and the degree of interconnectedness with other network firms (e.g., Swaminathan and Moorman 2009). The insights afforded by our research can help extend this stream of literature by emphasizing the dyad-specific flows of information and/or influence among specific pairs of network participants. A nuanced consideration of the identified factors that inhibit or enhance ability and motivation would further inform our understanding of network efficiency and knowledge redundancies and how they might affect network-participating members’ individual performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Managerial Implications</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For franchisees. Our post hoc calculations suggest that, compared with franchisor-owned outlets, a new franchisee-owned outlet may expect to gain 9.5% of mean annual sales, or just over $39,000, when clustered with mature same-brand outlets. Although this result runs counter to our expectation, one explanation for this might lie in new franchisees’ efforts to take advantage of the experience gained and knowledge shared by clustered mature outlets. Mature franchisee-owned outlets lose mean annual sales of 6.7% (just over $27,000) when clustered with other mature outlets of the same brand. Overall, our results imply that franchisees opening new outlets close to mature outlets of the same brand are likely to realize significant sales performance gains. In contrast, ceteris paribus, mature franchisees clustered with other mature same-brand outlets find themselves facing the prospect of intrabrand competition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For franchisors. Like franchisees, franchisor-owned outlets also experience a mixed bag when clustering with other same-brand outlets. A new franchisor-owned focal outlet loses nearly 10%, or just over $39,000, in mean annual sales when clustered with mature outlets. When new franchisor-owned outlets are clustered with other new outlets, the loss in sales is not nearly as bad—they lose an average of just over 3% of their mean annual sales, or close to $12,500. We also find that mature franchisor-owned outlets remain relatively unaffected by outlet clustering, regardless of whether the cluster comprises new or mature proximal outlets. Taken together, the pattern of results suggests that franchisors mindful of the sales performance of the outlets owned by them should avoid establishing these outlets in proximity to other same-brand outlets, whether mature or new.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across both franchisor- and franchisee-owned outlets, shared ownership of the focal and proximal outlets appears to help facilitate knowledge sharing and blunt intrabrand competition. Under shared ownership, newly established outlets clustered with mature outlets outperform their counterparts clustered with new outlets by nearly 1% of mean annual sales, or just under $5,000. For mature outlets, the difference is even more striking—mature outlets clustered with other mature outlets outperform their counterparts clustered with new outlets by nearly 3% of mean annual sales, or just under $11,500. Given that the average multiunit-owning entity (whether franchisor or multiunit franchisee) in this franchise system owns 21 outlets, the sales performance gains accruing from shared ownership are certainly significant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Limitations and Future Research Directions</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As with any research effort, our study has several limitations. First, our assessment of a single franchise system, albeit over an extended period, limits the generalizability of our findings. Future efforts that include multiple firms operating in diverse industries would help extend our findings by considering multiple franchise system outlets and their competitive and cooperative interactions over time.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, tracking an additional performance indicator (e.g., survival of the individual outlet) over the entire life cycle of the franchise system would provide additional insights into clustering and its performance consequences. Such data, were they to be available, would confer the ability to investigate the impact of clustering on outlets’ survival in the rich context of multiple franchise systems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, our reliance on longitudinal archival data, while affording insights into individual outlets’ evolving capabilities and constraints, also limits our ability to directly observe or measure the relevant franchise system participants’ perceptions and motivations. We can state only that their actions appear consistent with the perceptions and motivations we attribute to them. Future efforts to measure these unobserved intervening variables (e.g., by conducting surveys with the individual outlet operators, by designing laboratory experiments to provide a better understanding of the underlying conceptual mechanisms) and to integrate them with the archival data already available would yield rich insights.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H5</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Franchisor Versus Franchisee Ownership</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H1–H2</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Clustering</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Geographic concentration</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Accumulated Experience</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">of the focal outlet</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">of proximal outlets</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">H3–H4</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Shared Ownership</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Outlet Performance</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Sales revenue</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Control Variables</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Cluster size</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mean age of proximal outlets</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firm size</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Royalty rate</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interbrand competition</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Market population</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Income per capita</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Market area</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Year</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A: Logic for Knowledge Sharing and Intrabrand Competition Effects</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">B: Moderating Effect of Shared Ownership</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Notes: Subscripts “N” and “M” denote new and mature outlets, respectively.

Yet little is known about how donors respond to this marketing strategy. In seven studies, including two large-scale field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of PGIs depends on the organization's goals. People are more likely to open and read a letter containing a monetary PGI (vs. a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI). In addition, monetary PGIs increase response rates in donor acquisition campaigns. However, the return on investment for direct mail campaigns drops significantly when PGIs are included. Furthermore, average donations for appeals with a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI are similar, while those with a monetary PGI are actually lower than when a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI is included. This is because monetary PGIs increase exchange norms while decreasing communal norms. This effect remains significant when accounting for alternative explanations such as manipulative intent and the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: communal and exchange norms; donation behavior; donation incentives; field experiments; nonprofit marketing</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Not a week goes by that I don't receive requests for monetary donations to one charitable organization or another....However, I must ask these organizations if sending out hundreds of thousands of requests for donations with a nickel or dime attached inside an envelope full of address labels imprinted with my name and address is honestly worth it.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[45]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Most charitable organizations rely on individual donations to provide much-needed services, and over 90% of nonprofit organizations use direct mail as one of their primary fundraising methods ([40]). However, most direct mail campaigns achieve modest success, with an average response rate of 1% to 3.7% ([13]). To attract attention and encourage donations, charities often include pregiving incentives (PGIs), also known as unconditional gifts or front-end premiums, in their donation request letters (for examples, see Web Appendix A). A PGI is defined as the provision of a benefit or a favor before requesting compliance ([35]; [43]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In 2013–2015, PGIs such as coins and greeting cards were included in approximately 40% of the total nonprofit mail volume ([41]). In fact, inclusion of monetary PGIs is so popular, the strategy has its own moniker: "the coin trick" ([28]; [44]). Yet there are concerns over the effectiveness of this strategy ([49]). The goal of the present research is to address the question posed in the quote at the opening of this article—are PGIs in charitable campaigns worth it?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several streams of research have examined the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior (for a review, see [55]]), some yielding conflicting results. The literature on reciprocity shows that people feel a strong sense of obligation to repay benefits they have received, even if those benefits are unwanted ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref11" title="9">9</a>]; [22]). Accordingly, [15] found that including a small PGI, such as a postcard, in a charity appeal significantly increased the number of donations, though the average donation amount remained fairly constant. Motivation crowding theory, in contrast, proposes that external rewards diminish intrinsic motivation or sincerity to do good, which can result in reduced donations ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref14" title="5">5</a>]; [21]). For instance, [39] found that providing nonmonetary conditional/promised gifts (e.g., pens, reusable bags) <em>decreased</em> average donations because such external incentives "crowd out" altruistic motivations to donate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One limitation of the aforementioned literature is the focus on just one aspect of donation behavior: intrinsic characteristics of the donor (i.e., sense of obligation, intrinsic motivation). Yet offering incentives can also affect the relationship between two entities. Relationship norms between consumers and organizations are important to understand as they play a critical role in consumer reactions, including attitudes and behaviors toward a brand's marketing actions ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref17" title="2">2</a>]). To illustrate how incentives might influence a relationship, imagine a situation in which the person you have a burgeoning romantic relationship with gives you a $20 bill before asking you to attend a family function with them. We predict that the mere introduction of money is likely to lead you to question the nature of the relationship. But what if, rather than cash, your partner gives you a gift like a bottle of wine or heartfelt greeting card?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This scenario exemplifies a second limitation of prior research on incentives. It does not address how different <em>types</em> of incentives affect donations. The plethora of diverse gifts that charities send to potential donors can be classified into two groups: monetary and nonmonetary. In the current research, we draw on the interpersonal relationships literature to develop a framework for understanding consumer reactions to these two classes of PGIs. We propose that donors typically perceive charities as communal organizations and use communal norms when interacting with them. However, the inclusion of monetary PGIs diminishes communal norms while increasing exchange norms, resulting in lower average donations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research makes a number of theoretical and practical contributions. Although the literature on brand relationships is substantial, relatively little of it has examined relationship norms and factors that influence their salience (for a review, see [33]]). Foundational research in marketing manipulated the salience of communal and exchange norms using hypothetical scenarios grounded in personal relationships ([<a id="bib2up

In contrast, we show that organizations can unwittingly influence the salience of these norms simply by including gifts or incentives in their donation solicitations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The current research also extends recent work on how superficial elements of a donation appeal can influence donation behavior, even when the content is held constant ([50]). We show that PGIs are tangible cues that influence people's communal and exchange perceptions of the charitable organization, leading to sizable differences in donation behavior. In doing so, we answer calls for investigation of PGIs in the donation context, with an emphasis on "the influence of the type of gift" ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref22" title="4">4</a>], p. 1059).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our work has managerial implications for the hundreds of nonprofit organizations that include PGIs in their direct mail campaigns. As stated previously, including PGIs such as coins and greeting cards in direct mail campaigns is a common strategy for nonprofits ([41]). We use different methods, samples, and incentives to examine the effect of PGIs on multiple outcomes of interest to charitable organizations, including increasing awareness, procuring future donors, influencing consumer perceptions, and fundraising. Results indicate that PGIs have different effects on different outcomes, and that the best strategy depends on what the charity wants to achieve. For example, monetary incentives may not be effective at increasing the average donation amount but may help charities gain visibility and awareness by increasing the opening and response rate among people who have not donated before. Thus, the results of this research allow nonprofits to make more informed cost–benefit analyses in deciding whether strategies such as "the coin trick" are worth it.</p><a id="AN0146362525-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-2" title="Theoretical Development and Hypotheses">Theoretical Development and Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0146362525-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-3" title="Relationship Norms in the Marketplace">Relationship Norms in the Marketplace</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Extant research has identified two primary relationship norms that guide how people give and receive benefits: communal norms and exchange norms (e.g., [10]). Communal norms dictate that individuals attend to other's needs and demonstrate concern for one another. People following communal norms are motivated to care for others and are willing to incur costs to do so, regardless of whether they will receive anything in return. Most family relationships, romantic relationships and friendships are governed by communal norms ([10]). In comparison, exchange norms are those in which benefits are given with the expectation of receiving comparable benefits in return. Those who follow exchange norms are less likely to help others without a benefit or reward. A prototypical relationship example following exchange norms is that of business partners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Relationship norms influence interactions not only with individuals but also with marketplace entities.

[54] found that when communality was low, people expected businesses to provide services for their payments and viewed providers negatively during service failures. In contrast, when communality was high and self-obligation was highlighted, people behaved in a more caring and understanding manner, and thus reacted less negatively to service failures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond the situations manipulated in laboratory experiments, few marketplace interactions have been found to operate according to communal norms. This may be because previous research has largely focused on for-profit companies, which are generally perceived as providing benefits with the expectation of receiving comparable benefits in return. We propose that, unlike for-profit companies, nonprofits are perceived as high communality organizations that care for others' welfare and give benefits without expecting anything in return. In support of this, [<a id="bib1up

[36] identified additional organizations that consumers expect to have communal obligations (i.e., religious and pharmaceutical), and showed that people respond to the marketing efforts of these organizations differently than those of typical businesses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To further lay the foundation that nonprofits are seen as communally oriented, we conducted a pilot test on perceptions of a wide range of both for-profits and nonprofits (for details, see Web Appendix B). In addition, we examined the potential role of organizational familiarity, which has been shown to affect donors' inferences about the charity ([48]).

Money is more likely to evoke marketplace norms and lead people to behave in a quid pro quo manner (i.e., give comparable benefits for any benefits received) compared with nonmonetary goods ([24]). Activating the concept of money leads people to infer that they are in a businesslike or exchange relationship and behave as though they are interacting with a business party (e.g., [30]). Including a monetary PGI along with a donation appeal thus has the potential to increase exchange norms. At the same time, a monetary PGI should decrease communal norms. Reminders of money lead people to be more self-centered and eschew strong relational ties, such that they prefer not to rely on or be relied on by others ([53]). They may therefore be less inclined to think of relationships in communal terms after receiving a monetary PGI. We hypothesize that the increase in exchange and decrease in communal norms due to the presence of the monetary PGI will jointly lead to lower average donations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Nonmonetary PGIs are preferred over monetary ones in communal relationships, as they do not evoke marketplace norms in a payment context ([24]) and are consistent with communal norms. A nonmonetary gift may thus have the potential to increase communality. However, unlike exchange norms, communal norms do not dictate the prompt repayment of benefits given or received ([10]). Indeed, previous research shows that communal participants evaluate a brand more positively if the request for help from the brand is delayed compared with when it is made immediately ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref38" title="2">2</a>]). Giving a nonmonetary PGI and then asking for help straightaway is more aligned with exchange norms and could offset any communal increase from receiving a small gift, resulting in no overall change in communality. In addition, communal norms dictate noncontingent, need-based giving ([10]). Thus, whether and how much people donate should not depend on the presence or the value of nonmonetary PGIs. Taken together, this suggests that a nonmonetary PGI is unlikely to increase net communality (i.e., communal norms relative to exchange norms) or average donations in a direct mail campaign. It is relevant to note that our conceptualization suggests that a monetary PGI will lead to lower net communality but not necessarily flip the overall relationship from communal to exchange. Previous research typically manipulates communal versus exchange relationships, while less attention has been paid to how people react to communality variations on a continuum. Yet a review of the literature reveals that even manipulations of relationship norms, which clearly delineate their differences, do not always produce effects at the extreme ends of the continuum. For instance, [54]; Experiment 2) manipulation check showed that both the communal and exchange scenarios elicited communality scores above the midpoint of the seven-point scale (4.83 vs. 4.08, respectively), with a significant difference between the means. Despite the fact that both scores were on the communal end of the scale, their relative difference produced significant hypothesized effects in consumer behavior. Conceptually, this is explained by research showing that communal relationships vary along a continuum, with one's willingness to devote resources toward promoting the other's welfare increasing with higher levels of communality ([11]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, charities have campaign objectives other than maximizing individual contributions. Pregiving incentives may be useful for goals that are lower on the consumer response hierarchy such as increasing public awareness and enlarging the donor list ([32]). Research has shown that monetary incentives are more effective in eliciting survey responses than nonmonetary ones or no incentives, and monetary incentives are particularly useful for people who have no interests in the survey topic ([46]). Moreover, lay beliefs and laws guiding people on how to treat money may lead them to be reluctant to throw away cash (e.g., Title 18, Chapter 17, of the U.S. Code prohibits the debasement of coins). Thus, monetary PGIs could be effective in promoting initial engagement with a piece of mail, especially among individuals who are unfamiliar with the charity. In addition, opening rate is correlated with response rate, or the likelihood to act on the mailing ([17]). Charities can add these respondents to their mailing list for future campaigns. Thus, although our conceptualization predicts lower average donations with monetary PGIs (vs. nonmonetary and no PGIs), they may be effective for increasing opening and response rates, especially among people who are unfamiliar with the charity and thus need an incentive to open the envelope. Formally, we hypothesize:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Monetary PGIs (vs. nonmonetary or no PGIs) increase opening and response rates, particularly among people who are not familiar with the charity.</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><strong> H2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Monetary PGIs (vs. nonmonetary or no PGIs) lower average donations.

Study 3 examines the effect of PGIs on average donations using real incentives and contributions.

These studies use hypothetical incentives but ask participants to donate from their potential bonus payment to increase realism while curtailing study costs. Finally, Study 7 is a field experiment that examines the anchoring effect on response rate, average donations and ROI for a year-end campaign for recurring donors.</p><a id="AN0146362525-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-6" title="Study 1">Study 1</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Charities often have the goal to increase awareness and achieve high visibility through their donation campaigns ([48]). Encouraging potential donors to open the charity letter may be especially critical to the success of donor acquisition campaigns, in which appeals are sent to people who are unfamiliar with the charity or have never donated before. In this study, we explore the crucial question of how enclosures of PGIs affect how these individuals handle the letter. We predict that people are reluctant to throw away a piece of mail with money in it, which results in them opening and reading the letter (H<sub>1</sub>). We sample a diverse population by recruiting staff and faculty at a major U.S. university, who are likely to have more disposable income than convenience samples such as college students and online survey takers.</p><a id="AN0146362525-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-7" title="Participants and Procedure">Participants and Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two hundred forty university staff and faculty members from a large Midwestern university (187 female; M<sub>age</sub> = 46.02 years; M<sub>income</sub> = $75,000 to $99,000) participated in this study in exchange for either a $5 prepaid Visa card or a university branded gift of a similar value (e.g., hat, wine glasses).

The other five pieces of mail were the same across all three PGI conditions. There was one solicited letter (dental bill), and four unsolicited letters (SmartShopper ad, credit card offer, car insurance ad, and retirement insurance ad). We included both solicited and unsolicited letters to compare the treatment of the charity letter with mail of varying importance.

They were asked to sort the mail as they normally would and place each letter into the box corresponding to their decision. An "other" option was provided in case they intended to handle the letter differently. After the mail sorting task, participants answered a few demographic questions, chose either a Visa card or a university gift as their payment, and were thanked and dismissed.</p><a id="AN0146362525-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-9" title="Results and Discussion">Results and Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We compare the opening rate of the three PGI conditions next and report the comparison of each appeal against the solicited and unsolicited letters in Web Appendix C.</p><a id="AN0146362525-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-10" title="Unopen throw away">Unopen throw away</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consistent with H<sub>1</sub>, the number of people in the monetary PGI condition who chose to throw away the charity letter without opening it (16.46%, N = 13) was significantly lower than those in the nonmonetary PGI (45%, N = 36, χ<sup>2</sup>(<a id="bib1up

Study 1 suggests that a monetary PGI promotes this goal by persuading recipients to open and read the letter. In Study 2, we partner with a local mental health and suicide prevention nonprofit to examine more downstream consequences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As discussed in the "Conceptual Development" section, we predict that a monetary PGI (vs. nonmonetary and no PGI) will lead to lower average donations. We also examine how different types of PGIs affect the response rate, or number of replies to the mailing. Previous research has shown that monetary payments lead people to behave in a quid pro quo manner ([24]). Thus, after receiving a coin in the mail, people may respond by sending the money back to the organization. For low-value monetary PGIs, this would lead to lower average donations, but a higher response rate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because charitable organizations often lose money in donor acquisition campaigns, an important goal is to minimize losses ([47]). Thus, we measure the ROI for each type of PGI. We predict that enclosing PGIs, both monetary and nonmonetary, will lead to a lower ROI than not enclosing any PGI—although the response rate may be somewhat higher for monetary PGI appeals, average donations will be lower, and the total amount raised is unlikely to offset the high cost of sending PGIs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given the extremely low response rate for typical direct mail campaigns (.65%; [47]), it is difficult to draw conclusions from nonresponses about whether PGI had an impact on donation behavior. Nonresponses could be due to indifference toward the PGI, or because people never received or saw the letter. Thus, to calculate average donation amount, we analyzed data only from respondents who made a donation. This is consistent with prior research on donation appeals with low response rates ([14]). However, in estimating net loss per mailing, we included all those who had been solicited (N = 9,000), because ROI addresses whether the benefits of enclosing PGIs justify the total cost.</p><a id="AN0146362525-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-16" title="Materials">Materials</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0146362525-17"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-17" title="PGIs">PGIs</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An examination of over 100 charity letters revealed that common monetary PGIs range from a few cents to $2.50, and common nonmonetary PGIs include address labels, greeting cards, and note pads.

Such a response is predicted by the relationship norms framework, as lower communal norms and higher exchange norms lead to a one-to-one exchange mindset and less focus on others' needs. Charities recognize that initial contributions tend to be small, and they hope to cultivate first-time donors to give more over time; thus, the contact information for everyone who "acts upon the mailing" ([38]), including people mailing back the quarter, may be added to the donor pool for future campaigns.

Specifically, people may believe that charities that send money with their donation appeals use their resources less efficiently than those that do not.

We also examined manipulative intent and charity inefficiency as alternative explanations. Net communality remained a significant mediator after controlling for these constructs, while manipulative intent and charity inefficiency did not, suggesting that the simultaneous change in communal norms and exchange norms predicts donation behavior above and beyond the effects of manipulative intent and charity inefficiency. Further analyses on the relationship between these constructs reveal evidence of serial mediation, such that perceived higher charity inefficiency leads to lowered communality, resulting in lower donations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Results from Studies 2–4 have provided converging evidence that enclosing low-value monetary PGIs in charity appeals decreases communal norms and increases exchange norms, leading to lower average donations compared with nonmonetary PGIs or no PGI.

When communal norms are dominant, donations are need based rather than incentive based, so incentives should not play as pivotal a role in donation decisions ([37]). Because monetary PGIs evoke more exchange norms and less communal norms, they should lead people to make donations based more on how much they received than the perceived needs of the charity ([37]). In other words, high- (vs. low-) value monetary PGIs should result in higher donations. However, the value of a nonmonetary gift should have little impact on donations because, as explained previously, no change in net communality is expected. This is true regardless of the value of the gift. Moreover, considering that the amount of money to be reciprocated increases while need-based donations remain stable, it is possible that donations elicited by monetary PGIs will be greater than those elicited by nonmonetary PGIs at higher incentive values. Formally, we propose the following hypothesis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The effect of monetary and nonmonetary PGIs on donations is moderated by incentive value, such that a high-value monetary PGI leads to greater average donations than a low-value monetary PGI, whereas there will be no difference in average donations for high- vs. low-value nonmonetary PGIs. (b) A nonmonetary (vs. monetary) low-value PGI elicits higher donations, but this pattern is attenuated or reversed for high-value PGIs.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In testing this hypothesis, we also address an alternative explanation for the effect—that reminders of money lead people to be less prosocial (e.g., [52]). Consistent with this literature, receiving monetary PGIs should lead people to be less charitable and thus donate less. However, this theory does not make different predictions for high- versus low-value monetary PGIs. If the effect of PGI type on donation behavior is solely driven by the psychological consequences of money rather than the simultaneous movement of communal and exchange norms, we should expect a high-value monetary PGI to lead to lower donations than a comparable value nonmonetary PGI. The relationship norms framework, in contrast, would predict the opposite finding.</p><a id="AN0146362525-58"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-58" title="Participants and Procedure">Participants and Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One-hundred thirty-nine participants (73 women; M<sub>age</sub> = 37.07 years) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).

This is in line with our hypothesis that nonmonetary PGIs maintain perceptions of the charity as communally oriented and thus prompt norms of need-based helping rather than repayment of benefits.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Note that average donation for the high-value nonmonetary PGI appeal was directionally lower than the low-value nonmonetary PGI appeal (<em>p</em> =.14). One possible explanation is that, unlike money, greeting cards have diminishing marginal utility, leading to scope insensitivity (e.g., [29]). If this is the case, a set of disparate incentives should lead to greater perceived gift value and may increase donations. We tested this hypothesis in a follow-up study with three conditions (N = 273): one greeting card, eight greeting cards, or eight different gifts of similar cost including a pen, a note pad, a binder clip, a card, and so on (see Web Appendix E, Study 5). Results revealed no donation difference among the three conditions (M<sub>one card</sub> = $4.52, M<sub>eight cards</sub> = $3.95, M<sub>eight gifts</sub> = $4.69; all <em>p</em>s &gt;. 14). Thus, the inability of high-value nonmonetary incentives to increase donations is less likely to be due to scope insensitivity than the failure to increase communal (and decrease exchange) norms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Comparing between PGI types, $.25 led to significantly lower donations than one greeting card (<em>p</em> =.026). The effect is reversed for higher-value monetary and nonmonetary PGIs, such that $2.50 elicited significantly more donations than eight greeting cards (<em>p =</em>.024), although we suspect that this effect can be either attenuated or reversed depending on the value of the incentives. In practice, enclosing a high-value monetary PGI may not be desirable or feasible for charities, considering the high cost as well as the low average return.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 5 helps establish relationship norms as a primary contributor to donation decisions. In the next study, we consider a potential low-cost way to improve average donations. Charitable organizations are highly strategic about the choice of wording in their appeals. So far, we have used the common phrasing of the PGI as a gift (e.g., Smile Train uses the statement "We have enclosed a world map as our free gift to you.") Yet charities may be interested in the comparative effectiveness of framing the gift in a different way. For example, Obis (an international eye care charity) encloses a nickel in its charity appeal and states, "This nickel can help restore a child's vision." Food for the Poor says in its charity appeals, "Please return these coins along with your gift." A reasonable question is whether such statements mitigate or enhance the changes in exchange and communal norms from monetary PGIs. In the next study, we explore the effect of framing on relationship norms, response rate, average donations, and the alternative explanations of charity inefficiency and manipulative intent. Doing so also allows us to test the generalizability and external validity of the focal effect.</p><a id="AN0146362525-62"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-62" title="Study 6">Study 6</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 6 examines the effect of framing the monetary gift in various ways. We approached this study in an exploratory manner with the goal of testing two competing hypotheses. It is possible that phrasing a monetary PGI in a more communal way will prevent exchange norms from increasing and communal norms from decreasing. For instance, the phrasing "this nickel can help restore a child's vision" may lead people to interpret the enclosure of the monetary PGI as a demonstration to illustrate that even a little money can help the cause, which is compatible with the communal nature of the charity. However, this is an empirical question, as previous research suggests the effect of money on marketplace norms is strong and consistent ([24]; [30]; [53]). Phrasing the gift in a communal way may do little to change donor behavior if a monetary mindset has already been activated. Indeed, [36] demonstrated that it is possible to improve consumer sentiment by reframing commercial marketing strategies as communal, unless consumers were already in a persuasion frame of mind. Thus, we suspect that, regardless of the phrasing for the monetary PGI, its mere inclusion will consistently lead to lower donations compared with a nonmonetary PGI and no PGI.</p><a id="AN0146362525-63"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-63" title="Participants and Procedure">Participants and Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Five hundred seven MTurk workers (282 women; M<sub>age</sub> = 37.11 years) were randomly assigned to one of five conditions in which they saw a charity appeal from the fictitious food charity in Study 5.

We did find an unexpected effect in the monetary-help condition, in that it leads people to perceive the charity as more communal than those in the monetary-gift condition. A follow-up study (N = 166 MTurkers) revealed no differences among the two phrasings on perceived impact of their donations, perceived efficacy, perceived self-concept (moral/ethical), positive/negative affect, and empathy (all <em>p</em>s &gt;.18). We suspect that the phrasing in the monetary-help condition maintains the perceived communality of the charity by focusing on the victims and emphasizing the compassionate nature of the organization. However, the negative effect of charity inefficiency produced by the coin was strong enough to overcome this perception and lower overall donations compared with the nonmonetary PGI and no-PGI conditions, as demonstrated by the serial mediation results (PGI type → charity inefficiency → net communality → donations; see Web Appendix I). These findings suggest that enclosing monetary PGIs leads to lower average donations, regardless of how monetary PGIs are phrased.</p><a id="AN0146362525-73"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-73" title="Study 7">Study 7</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In Study 7, we again partnered with the mental health clinic in Study 2 to launch a large-scale direct mail campaign. Unlike Study 2, this study targets existing donors in a year-end campaign. The goals of this study are threefold. First, we examine whether the PGI effects generalize to a warm mailing list (i.e., people who already have a relationship with the charity). We expect that such a sample will result in a higher overall response rate than Study 2 because people are more likely to open mail from a known sender. However, effects on relationship norms, and thus average donations, should be the same. Second, we test another alternative explanation for the effect of PGIs on donations—the anchoring and adjustment heuristic ([51]). This hypothesis suggests that people who receive a monetary PGI use the coin(s) as a reference point or anchor and thus donate less than when a low-value numerical anchor is not present. In this study, we include the same anchor in all the charity appeals. If the results are due to anchoring rather than relationship norms, this should erase the effect of PGI type on donations. Third, we include a different nonmonetary PGI to make sure the effect is not an artifact of the gift we chose. Although greeting cards are an externally valid PGI currently used by charities, they are also thin and made out of paper, making them vulnerable to being overlooked or accidentally discarded. Furthermore, a greeting card may be seen as a communal gift. Therefore, in this study, we use a magnet as the nonmonetary PGI, which is more of a neutral incentive and less likely to go unnoticed in an envelope. A pretest confirmed that the magnet and coin did not elicit differences in perceived costs or benefits (Web Appendix D).</p><a id="AN0146362525-74"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-74" title="Materials">Materials</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0146362525-75"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-75" title="Mailing list">Mailing list</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We randomly selected 2,643 donors from the charity's existing donor list and assigned them to one of the three PGI conditions: monetary ($.25), nonmonetary (a magnet), or no PGI.</p><a id="AN0146362525-76"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-76" title="Business reply return envelopes">Business reply return envelopes</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consistent with Study 2, a standard business reply return envelope was enclosed within each letter.

Results from Study 3 provide further evidence that enclosing a monetary PGI leads people to donate less money than a nonmonetary PGI and no PGI, and enclosing a nonmonetary PGI is no more effective than when no PGI is included. Results from Study 4 show that reduced donations in the monetary incentive condition are due to decreased net communality levels. Study 4 also tests manipulative intent and charity inefficiency as alternative explanations and demonstrate a significant effect of net communality over and above their influence. Consistent with the relationship norms framework, Study 5 shows that the effect of PGI type is moderated by incentive value. A high-value monetary PGI leads to more donations than a low-value monetary PGI, whereas there is no difference for high- versus low-value nonmonetary PGIs. Study 6 shows that phrasing a monetary PGI in various ways consistently leads to lower donations than a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI. Finally, Study 7 shows that a donation campaign for recurring donors utilizing a different nonmonetary PGI supports the conclusions that a monetary PGI decreases average donations compared with a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI.

In contrast, the current research examines how these norms affect consumer perception and behavior in the context of nonprofit organizations. For-profits and nonprofits are governed by different relationship norms, such that for-profit companies operate on exchange norms, whereas the default relationship norms for nonprofit companies are communal. This fundamental difference affects how people respond to these organizations at baseline, and indicates that using incentives as a marketing strategy has disparate effects on consumer behavior for these two categories of organizations. Second, instead of manipulating the salience of the communal and exchange norms through hypothetical scenarios, as is common in previous research, we examine how strategies that nonprofits currently use and have full control over organically influence the salience of these norms. Our results suggest that PGIs affect communal and exchange norms simultaneously and that these norms have a dual impact on donations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We add to recent work on how people make inferences about an organization based on superficial elements in direct mail campaigns ([50]). We show that PGIs serve as cues about the organization, influencing communal and exchange norms. Lower net communality from monetary PGIs leads people to behave in a quid pro quo manner and be less likely to donate based on perceived need. This is true even though the net communality score remained significantly above the midpoint of the scale (Study 4: M<sub>monetary</sub> = 4.63, <em>p</em> &lt;.001; Study 6: M<sub>monetary</sub> = 4.86, <em>p</em> &lt;.001). Finally, we contribute to the PGI literature (e.g., [35]) by moving beyond general conclusions about all incentives to a nuanced account of how and why different types of PGIs affect donation behaviors.</p><a id="AN0146362525-90"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-90" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research addresses the question of whether including PGIs is a worthwhile strategy for charities.

If the goal of the campaign is to raise awareness and to help the charity gain exposure, enclosing a monetary PGI appears to be an effective strategy. Our research suggests that enclosing a monetary PGI persuades recipients not only to open the letter, but to read it. Notably, the charity we used to test this hypothesis was fictional and thus unfamiliar to all participants. It is reasonable to assume that the decision to open a letter will be multiply determined when donors are already aware of the charity. A PGI (or its absence) may not be as powerful of a contributing factor for existing donors. However, given that there are over a million charities in the United States ([26]), many of which are unknown to a significant number of Americans, this effect is an important consideration for many.</p><a id="AN0146362525-92"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-92" title="Response rate">Response rate</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Enclosing a monetary PGI may help organizations achieve the goal of enlarging the donor pool for future campaigns. Results from the donor acquisition campaign (Study 2) showed that a monetary PGI led to a significantly higher response rate than both a nonmonetary PGI and no PGI, whereas there were no differences between the nonmonetary and no-PGI conditions. However, 15 of 27 people in the monetary PGI condition returned/donated the enclosed $.25, and charities need to decide whether to consider them potential future donors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The results for response rate were not consistent across all studies. We found an unexpectedly high response rate for the nonmonetary PGI condition in Study 6 and no response rate difference in any other study, including the annual campaign (Study 7). These results should be interpreted in light of the results in Study 1, in which we found that the opening rate was higher for letters containing a monetary PGI for an unfamiliar charity. This could have led to the higher response rate in the first field study, which utilized a cold mailing list. Donors in Study 7 were already familiar with the charity, having donated to them before, so opening rate for this segment should be higher overall, and less likely to be dependent on the presence of a gift. The same line of reasoning applies to the lab experiments. All participants were forced to open and read the letter, negating any effect of opening rate on donation likelihood. In other words, opening the letter is a necessary condition for responding to it. However, as discussed previously, the number of people who open the letter is partially determined by whether the donor is familiar with the organization. Thus, monetary PGIs may be especially beneficial for charities that are lesser known or just starting to build their donor list.</p><a id="AN0146362525-93"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-93" title="Average donation">Average donation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If the primary goal of the campaign is to maximize the contribution of each donor, results consistently show that inclusion of monetary PGIs is a bad idea, regardless of how the incentive is couched.

The effectiveness of PGIs on total donations may depend on who the recipients are. In Study 2, the most donations came from the monetary PGI appeal, whereas in Study 7, the no-PGI appeal raised the most money.

We suggest that this is because an immediate ask for help accompanying the gift offsets any increase in communality from the gift itself. Indeed, results from an unreported MTurk study (N = 152) showed that net communality was significantly lower when participants were asked for a donation immediately after receiving a PGI than when they were given a gift without a donation request (M<sub>immediate donation</sub> = 4.17, M<sub>gift only</sub> = 4.83; <em>p</em> &lt;.001). Further analyses showed that participants in the immediate donation condition scored significantly lower on communal norms and significantly higher on exchange norms compared with those in the gift-only condition (both <em>p</em>s &lt;.01).

However, the inclusion of multiple studies in the paper and the web appendix showing consistent effects, some with relatively large sample sizes, should help alleviate this concern.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another limitation of this research is that it does not explore the long-term consequences of PGIs. For example, charities may enjoy additional benefits from nonmonetary gifts if people find items with the names and logos of the organization practical and use them regularly. Cognitive dissonance theory ([18]) predicts that, over time, this action will strengthen recipients' feelings of connection to the charity. In addition, appraisals of their own behavior ("If I am associating myself with this charity, I must think it is a worthwhile cause") may lead them to make donations in the future. Public display of the charity name and logo could also serve as advertising for people who were previously unaware of the organization. A longitudinal study could be used to test these hypotheses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future research might also find it fruitful to explore the effect of PGIs on other outcomes. In Web Appendix M, we examine the effect of PGIs on donations of time. Unlike money, PGI type had no impact on time donations. Research insights from a 2014 survey may shed light on why this is. Among donors, "financial support usually comes first" and "few volunteer for sectors that they are not also supporting financially" ([19]). In addition, time is personally more meaningful than money, and motivations and beliefs can lead to very different effects on time versus money donations ([31]). Thus, people who are willing to donate money may not be willing to donate time. We hope this research will spur further investigation on PGIs and prosocial behavior of all kinds.</p><a id="AN0146362525-98"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0146362525-98" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, UPDATED_Web_Appendix_JM.18.0163 - Coins Are Cold and Cards Are Caring: The Effect of Pregiving Incentives on Charity Perceptions, Relationship Norms, and Donation Behavior</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, UPDATED_Web_Appendix_JM.18.0163 for Coins Are Cold and Cards Are Caring: The Effect of Pregiving Incentives on Charity Perceptions, Relationship Norms, and Donation Behavior by Bingqing (Miranda) Yin, Yexin Jessica Li and Surendra Singh in Journal of Marketing</p><a id="AN0146362525-99"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0146362525-99" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Associate Editor Vanitha Swaminathan</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  Declaration of Conflicting Interests The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the University of Kansas General Research Fund allocation # 2301009 granted to the first and the second author, and the DSRF Dissertation Fund granted to the first author.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  Online supplement: https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242920931451</em></p><a id="AN0146362525-100"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0146362525-100" title=" References  "> References  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em> Aaker Jennifer, Vohs Kathleen D., Mogliner Cassie.

Conventionally, research in marketing has explained this complex process by stressing firms' efforts to outdo their peers. While this emphasis is valuable, it overlooks the role of another major force in market evolution: collective action among peer firms. To address this oversight, this article conceptualizes "collaborative market driving," defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms consistently cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop markets in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This conceptualization includes the triggers that lead peer firms to mobilize for collective action and coalesce with other market actors; it also identifies how this coalition converts collective resources into market-driving power. These theoretical contributions, based on a multimethod analysis of the rise of U.S. craft breweries, offer an alternative course of action for firms interested in driving new markets when they lack adequate resources to do so individually.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: entrepreneurship; interfirm collaboration; market development driving; market orientation; trade associations</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Firms often aim to develop markets as part of their long-term strategies. This process usually involves high risks, but it may also bring high rewards. These rewards include generating novel revenue streams and opportunities for firms to build sustainable competitive advantage ([12]; [20]; [46]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When firms set out to develop markets, they often relate to their direct competitors as rivals. Fittingly, marketing research has made insightful contributions to guide companies through this approach. This literature explains, for example, why and how firms should create technological innovations that make them market pioneers and market share leaders ([35]; [50]; [61]; [71]; [94]). Furthermore, this literature highlights strategies that do not hinge on specific innovations but, rather, on the construction of powerful brands through which firms can command premium prices and favorable media attention ([40]; [43]). In these individualistic approaches to market development, firms see the marketplace as a zero-sum game. Though they typically cooperate with supply chain members, they remain strongly self-oriented concerning their competitors, trying to develop a brand reputation that is superior to that of their peers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The focus of this literature on firms' individualistic efforts is valuable, as it offers insights on actions that single organizations can take to outdo competitors. However, this focus has occluded from view the role of another major approach for peer firms to develop markets, namely collective action—the purposively organized activities of a group of actors to create what they see as a common good ([16]; [83]). As both conceptual and empirical research indicate ([46]; [60]; [81]), many firms lack adequate means to develop markets. In response, they often pool resources with other actors, including those conceived of as their rivals and consumers. This form of collective action is observable at the origin of some major markets. For example, whereas Ford Motors is credited as the central figure in developing the mass market for cars, the coordinated action of multiple automakers and consumers was vital to diffusing this innovation in the United States ([81]). Likewise, for less technological sectors such as the now-ubiquitous organic food category, market development relied not only on Americans' increased interest in healthier diets but also on the collaboration of peer firms with consumers ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref17" title="5">5</a>]; [102]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In light of this evidence, we shift marketing theory's usual focus away from firms' individualistic work concerning their competitors; we direct attention, instead, to the collective action of peer firms in market development. Such a shift has been adopted to some extent in previous research. In studying the growth of minivans and casino gambling in the United States, [85] and [42] reveal the cumulative impact of peer firms' coherent media messages in shaping consumer preferences. Focusing on the growth of nouvelle cuisine, [82] unpack the role of entrepreneurs' pursuits of greater public recognition in propelling the formation of a new market. Nevertheless, such work has rarely focused on coordinated action, leaving underspecified how collaboration among peer firms and their allies arises and leads to market development, a gap noted by some scholars ([13]; [83]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To address this gap, we study a recent case of market development that has involved peer firm collaboration: the rise of craft beer in the United States ([13]). We use this case to conceptualize "collaborative market driving," defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms consistently cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop markets in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. We address two questions about this strategy: What triggers market actors to mobilize for collaborative market driving? And, once mobilized, how do these actors deploy collective resources to drive the development of a market?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Using our data, we formulate a theory highlighting that, as a precondition to collaborative marketing driving, firms recognize market opportunities that they try to seize individually, only to realize they share systemic constraints such as limited economic and political power on doing so. This realization, though, does not lead spontaneously to collective action. Before this form of action can occur effectively, these firms must form a sense of collective identity, which can be facilitated by suprafirm entities that emerge as coordinators of firms' market-driving efforts. These firms achieve this sense of shared identity by formulating a goal they view as worthy of jointly pursuing and by intentionally cultivating social networks. As often happens in market development, this process also enrolls allies out of the supply chain that can provide these firms with critical resources to pursue their common goal. Once mobilized as a coalition, these market actors convert their collective resources into economic and political initiatives to drive the development of a market that benefits these firms as a whole.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This theorizing enables us to make three contributions to the growing literature on what [46] term "market driving." As a route to market development, market driving occurs when firms shape markets without being primarily guided by marketing intelligence. Instead, they focus on their internal resources and vision to create new offerings and then work to align consumer preferences with these offerings ([11]; [43]; [56]). Our first contribution is to identify how these resources and vision differ in individualistic and collaborative approaches to market driving, leading peer firms and their allies to engage in various cooperative initiatives and roles. Marking these distinctions extends the typology of market driving strategies, a theoretical move advocated by [45] to systematize understanding of how companies can shape market evolution.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our second contribution is bringing into focus an overlooked actor that can decisively influence market driving: trade associations ([91]). In particular, we conceptualize this class of suprafirm entities as coordinators of peer firms' collaboration, thus attending to research maintaining that some form of coordination is vital for effective collective action in the economic arena ([16]; [68]; [73]; [74]). Over 4,000 trade associations operate at the national level in the United States ([92]), but they appear sparsely in marketing scholarship ([<a id="bib4up

By unpacking trade associations' roles in collaborative marketing driving, we answer calls for an amplified focus in the study of market development—one that goes beyond sellers and buyers to more accurately understand this phenomenon ([10]; [42]; [54]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our third contribution is to extend theory on the role of consumers in market driving. In addition to their established importance as buyers, consumers often participate in market driving as members of brand communities, engaging in word of mouth and cocreating new products with a specific firm they admire ([18]; [88]). Conversely, research also shows that consumers influence the trajectory of markets when they oppose certain businesses, forcing them to review their practices ([30]; [51]; [81]). Nevertheless, less is known about how markets evolve when consumers systematically join forces with (vs. oppose) an entire set of firms (vs. a single one). Here, we explain how firms and consumers form coalitions and act concertedly to drive markets.</p><a id="AN0144933216-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-2" title="Methodology">Methodology</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0144933216-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-3" title="Data Collection">Data Collection</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research is based on an extended case study ([<a id="bib8up

The observation window goes from the late 1970s, when new craft breweries began to open, to 2016, when their growth slowed down. As Figure 1 shows, these firms had near-zero market share in their first decade; only a few operated in an industry dominated by a handful of corporations and their aesthetically similar beers. Fast-forwarding to 2016, however, the market differed considerably: there were more than 5,000 craft breweries, which accounted for about 20% of sales in the $100 billion U.S. beer market and the broadening of beer products and flavors in the marketplace ([99]). Notably, this growth was not based on new consumers entering the larger beer market. Rather, craft breweries gained traction mainly by altering the preferences of consumers who used to buy from incumbents ([49]; [70]; [99]).

This identification involved performing open coding on all data sources, and then axial coding to find convergent and divergent themes that required elucidation. As the analysis progressed, we engaged in the dialectical tacking between data and theory through which ethnographers form, revise, and expand their understanding of a phenomenon.

They do not engage in collective action, only later realizing they share systemic constraints that limit an individualistic approach to market driving. In stage 2, "mobilization of peer firms and allies," producers transition into a collective ethos. This change hinges on specific triggers that coalesce peer firms around a common goal while recruiting other market actors, such as consumers, as their allies. These triggers are facilitated by suprafirm entities that emerge as coordinators of collective action. In stage 3, "concerted action of peer firms and allies," the coalition formed by these entities, peer firms, and allies deploy collective resources into economic and political power to drive the development of a market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

In the cultural realm, social movements were reshaping the country's ideological scene, including that on food. Some of these movements vilified mass-production practices that increased shelf life in foods and beverages at the expense of flavor, as with beer ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref72" title="5">5</a>]). This public reproach led many Americans to valorize foods and drinks that are produced in small batches to retain freshness and create aesthetic complexity ([63]). In the legal realm, an excise tax that affected small breweries was cut by 22% through a law enacted in 1976. Furthermore, home brewing, an activity that serves as an incubator of craft breweries, was legalized in 1978.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These cultural and legal shifts create what [90] term "environmental opportunities" (Figure 2, stage 1, core processes): these opportunities can benefit many entrepreneurs though other actors and events bring them about. Many beer consumers noticed these opportunities; they then began brewing beer of varied flavors as a hobby, and some turned this activity into a business. They joined the only two recognized craft breweries of that time, Anchor Steam and New Albion. This consumer-led origin makes craft beer a market that grew from amateurs' entrepreneurial deeds ([65]).</p><a id="AN0144933216-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-10" title="Internal and External Constraints">Internal and External Constraints</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite these environmental opportunities, craft breweries struggled for another decade to gain traction with mainstream consumers, mainly because of two internal and two external constraints they later came to recognize they had in common. The first internal shared constraint was <em>limited financial resources</em>. Most pioneering craft brewers were amateur consumers who had little cash to invest in the capital-intensive business of commercial brewing; furthermore, most banks refused to give them loans due to the risks associated with new business forms. This constraint led many to start their firms through some financial improvisation, a condition that remains true today, as when craft brewers buy used materials and work other jobs to make ends meet.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second internal shared constraint was limited know-how. While home brewing allowed would-be craft brewers to test beer recipes, it did not expose them to the difficulties of building and running industrial facilities. Many had trouble finding reliable information to help them scale up their hobbies. In a craft beer pioneer's words:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There weren't brewing schools or people to teach you. We barely knew what we were doing. What is the break-even point of a small brewery? What is the commercial process to brew this new beer style? How to choose a location? How do I avoid bacteria in commercial brewing?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As with financial resources, many craft brewers presently face know-how limitations, often lacking extensive training in business and technical areas of brewing such as chemistry.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond these internal constraints, two external ones confronted these underresourced craft brewers. The first was adverse regulations. Most states prohibited these brewers from having brewpubs where they could sell food, a key strategy to introduce their products to mainstream consumers through cross-selling. Furthermore, many state laws mandated that small breweries could sell beer only through distributors, even though most of these distributors were (and still are) controlled by industry incumbents through massive commercial incentives and direct ownership.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to restrictive finances, know-how, and regulations, these underresourced firms dealt with adverse consumer preferences, the second major shared external constraint our data foreground. Craft brewers' initial clientele consisted mostly of other beer enthusiasts; these peer firms both educated these avid consumers and followed their tastes. In this way, craft breweries' market-driving strategy had a market-driven genesis; it responded to some manifest customer needs ([20]; [53]). But mainstream consumers tended to reject more flavorful beers, precluding a larger-scale version of such approach. Incumbents' light-flavored beers had homogenized their tastes, as this craft beer pioneer reminisces:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our IPA and Hefeweizen [beer styles], our bestsellers today, didn't sell anything in the 1980s. I still remember this one guy who walked up to the bar and said, "You got any new beers?" My bartender goes, "We have a Hefeweizen." The customer looks at it, takes a big sip, and says, "That's the worst beer I've ever had. It tastes like bananas!" So, here's a guy that orders a Hefeweizen and didn't even know that it actually should taste like bananas.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We conceptualize collaborative market driving as a coordinated response to the recognition of these systemic constraints by peer firms (Figure 2, stage 1, outcomes). However, this response is not inevitable. As social movement scholarship shows (for a review, see [69]]), shared constraints do not translate spontaneously into collective action to change the status quo. In fact, for most of the 1980s, these firms dealt with their obstacles in a dispersed manner, as when they sporadically visited one another to discuss beer making. These brewers describe this period of relative isolation as one of self-absorption and discovery: "We were pretty much on our own, teaching ourselves how to run a small brewery, trying to make a living....Somewhere along the way, it seems we <em>realized</em> [emphasis added] we couldn't grow this thing by ourselves."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This realization followed the emergence of suprafirm entities. These entities, namely trade associations, gradually formed around these firms to grapple with a core barrier for collective action: organizing ([16]; [74]). A few of them began in period 1, when some craft breweries (e.g., Sierra Nevada) and avid consumers (e.g., home brewer Charles Papazian, considered the father of the craft beer revival) stepped up to found and run them in their spare time with nominal budgets (Figure 2, stage 1, core processes). These actors did not shun the prospect of individually benefiting from craft beer's growth. Still, they also desired to alter the broad conditions of a market for the advantage of other actors, a motive that often guides entrepreneurs and avid consumers ([64]; [87]). However, these rudimentary associations only organized few events, with little sway over other producers and consumers. Period 2 was when they grew in number and professionalism, incorporating paid staff and directors. Late in period 3, they consisted of a vast web, with an umbrella organization working at the national level and about 60 others, called "guilds," operating at nonoverlapping localities. These organizations act like labor unions, representing members' interests while being legally autonomous. In the next section, we analyze how these trade associations, as they became professionalized, triggered the mobilization of multiple market actors for collaborative market driving.</p><a id="AN0144933216-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-11" title="Stage 2: Mobilization of Peer Firms and Allies">Stage 2: Mobilization of Peer Firms and Allies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mobilization refers to the process of both marshaling actors and making them ready for action ([66]).

In the 2003 edition of <em>The Complete Joy of Homebrewing</em>, a best-selling book that this association published for home brewers and aspiring craft brewers, the introduction states: "Our beer world is so much better than it was in the 1980s and early 1990s. But don't forget for a moment that the large brewing companies of the world continue to 'squeeze' the market with their lighter-flavored product, always trying to minimize choice" (10). Later, as this association set out to expand craft beer's appeal to mainstream consumers, it created several variants of this message. An exemplar is this rhythmic excerpt from a pamphlet circulated in many local bars:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We hail the bold brewers who have built paradise/Saving beer from dilution by corn and rice.../May our passion for quality never be stopped/In the land of the free and the brave and the hopped/We salute with this glorious beer in our hand/Let the true taste of freedom clink out 'cross this land.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Industry incumbents use high levels of corn and rice in their flagship brands to sell beer at lower prices and deliver mild flavors to mainstream consumers. In the post-WWII era, these practices cohered with the democratic ethos that backed the diffusion of mass-produced consumer goods in the United States ([14]). But messages such as the preceding one invert the meaning of these practices, diagnosing them as yielding low-quality products and reducing market choice. Furthermore, such messages contain a prognosis: they advance "bold brewers" as market protagonists imbued with a "passion for quality" that will "save" beer from the dilution and homogenization caused by market antagonists, namely corporate breweries.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Craft breweries echo this message at their consumer touchpoints. Rather than touting their products' quality, they focus on asserting that light-flavored beers are a problem created by corporations, as in this brewer's speech during a brewery tour with consumers: "You are not going to find corn or rice in our beers. Do you know why corporate breweries put a blue indicator on their cans to show the beer is cold? They don't want you to drink these beers when they are not cold. Corn and rice are cheaper but taste terrible at higher temperatures."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The emphasis on the motives of a set of peer firms contrasts with advertising focused on the benefits of a single firm's offering, which typifies individualistic approaches to market driving ([31]; [85]). To make these motives more meaningful, trade associations tie craft breweries' activities to certain cultural ideals, as in this point-of-sale material:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I declare the beer I choose to enjoy is...an artistic creation of living liquid history made from passionate innovators...[and that] American craft brewers provide flavorful and diverse American-made beers in more than 100 distinct styles that have made the United States the envy of every beer-drinking nation for the quality and variety of beers brewed....Craft brewers represent the purest form of the American spirit and are dedicated to nurturing and enriching their communities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This parody of the U.S. Declaration of Independence offers another prognosis: it glorifies craft brewers as producers who want to revive Americans' dear ideals of entrepreneurship, independence, and idyllic communities. Much like the rhetoric of social movements, this messaging links up these brewers' market goals with noble purposes, a strategy that serves to broaden the appeal of a change project and increase its potential to attract allies ([81]). We argue that in collaborative market driving, these links do more than that. They partially eclipse this strategy's self-serving economic benefit, which could otherwise undermine the sense of disinterestedness that is vital to the credibility of a cause and its leaders ([39]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Craft brewers do not uniformly buy into these idealistic messages. Since the 1990s, dozens have sold their businesses to the corporate breweries their associations have disparaged. Yet these messages foster an ethos that guides the relations of the firms that remain committed to developing a market through collective action. As with this craft brewer, many others refer to this ethos as "a rising tide floats all boats":</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There's a common cliché, "a rising tide floats all boats," and that sentiment has been around. There's competition in that we're all in the [craft beer] industry...[but] Budweiser, Coors, and Miller, regardless of the growth of our industry, still stand for most beer consumed in the U.S. right now. We're the small guys, with our arms locked together.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The same ethos patterns the experiences of many craft beer consumers, who come to see themselves as craft breweries' allies.[<a id="bib9up

Now, I keep thinking, "Damn! They [corporate breweries] made me waste all these years drinking awful beer (laugh)!" And then you get to know what craft brewers are doing, creating neat spaces for people to hang out.... I see myself more than a consumer; I'm kind of a <em>supporter</em> [emphasis added], actually.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When developing a new market, competitors often use coherent messages to signal to external audiences (e.g., consumers) what the market stands for ([52]; [72]; [85]). In addition to this role, promoting a shared cause serves to mobilize stakeholders for collective action. [81] notes the role of this trigger at the start of many markets, such as that for personal computers, when retailers and early adopters claimed to be promoting technological democratization. This type of mobilization hinges on neither direct coercion nor measurable incentives; thus, it differs from the processes that explain collective action in mainstream economic theory ([60]; [73]). Instead, the promotion of a shared cause works by offering a long-term goal that peer firms and potential allies consider worthy of jointly pursuing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Promoting a shared cause is, therefore, foundational for mobilizing actors for market driving. However, it alone has a limitation for setting collective action in motion: it does not automatically create the social networks that enable the translation of abstract goals into pragmatic doings ([69]). The next subsection sheds light on how craft breweries' trade associations cultivate these networks, which include consumers as critical members.</p><a id="AN0144933216-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-13" title="Institutionalizing Bonding Opportunities">Institutionalizing Bonding Opportunities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This mobilization trigger refers to the purposive creation of occasions for market actors to develop social cohesion; such occasions are primary for collective action, mainly when this involves a large group of actors ([74]).

For example, they organize regular meetings that facilitate sociality and genuine communication among local brewers, as this craft brewer discloses:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We're all super busy running our businesses. Brewers are kind of jack-of-all-trades....If we were to try to coordinate just our own sort of meetings, it'd never happen. The guild is community building, so we don't become a bunch of jerks. It's a forum to air any grievances that we have and work together to solve them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Professional meetings can be a source of distress, but they can also be bonding events when organized around a regular set of participants and presumed goodwill ([57]). Through such meetings, the web of local guilds forms an apparatus of social cohesion that prevents craft brewers from drifting apart due to misunderstandings and individual business demands that could run counter to the formation of a strong collective identity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While opportunities like regular meetings foster local producer bonds, others such as trade conferences foster these bonds across localities. In the leading conference run by the national trade association, craft brewers from many places engage in the usual activities of business conventions, such as visiting a trade show ([76]). Distinctive about it is the volume of activities designed to connect brewers. Every conference day, they join in foosball tournaments, brewery tours, and parties lavishly supplied with craft beer. Sociality happened organically in the conferences that gathered nearly 100 brewers in period 1, and it became a planned feature in period 2, when attendance exceeded the thousands. These events connect craft brewers who are not in regular contact, as revealed by this craft brewer's testimonial captured in situ at a recent conference edition, with over 10,000 brewers:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I don't leave the brewery very often, so once a year, I make the time to come here. I always walk away smarter than I was, but it's also just this energy and camaraderie and enthusiasm. That always reminds me of why I got into the brewing industry in the first place...I always hear inspiring stories from other breweries, their struggles, how they overcame them.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These events instill in geographically distant producers a sense of camaraderie and energy ([15]) to continue pursuing their shared cause.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To mobilize allies for this cause, craft breweries' associations institutionalized opportunities for producer–consumer bonding. This occurs within and across localities, too. At the local level, exemplars of this mobilization trigger are the craft beer festivals that happen throughout the country every year. These festivals grew with the expansion of guilds, their main organizers: from 5 festivals in early period 1 to over 150 in late period 3. In their typical format, consumers pay for tickets that they exchange for beer samples at craft breweries' stands, where they chat with brewers about beer making and tasting. We also witnessed these actors mingling while playing lawn games and eating at communal tables. These occasions are socially valuable because brewers spend most of their time in breweries' backstage, as this consumer notes:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It's nice to actually talk to brewers....Some people who like craft beer are also interested in learning more about how beer is made. At the festival, we can hang out and ask questions to brewers. It makes for a more personal connection....When Budweiser sends someone to beer festivals, it's usually a sales guy or a promoter that knows nothing about beer making.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By mixing consumption with sociality and entertainment, these local events suspend firms' commercial interests, stressing, instead, humanized buyer–seller ties ([76]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To bond producers with consumers across localities, craft breweries' trade associations run large-scale events such as The National Homebrew Day. Established in 1988, it now happens every May in hundreds of different sites in the United States (more than 400 as of 2016), when craft breweries gather with home brewers and other avid consumers to jointly brew a beer batch. For this day, the craft breweries' national association instructs participants from all U.S. states to brew the same beer recipe. Furthermore, regardless of time zones, this association asks all participants to raise their glasses to celebrate craft beer and home brewing at a single time.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Emphasizing synchronicity in these events (i.e., same day and time of activities) is not pointless.

Through invented occasions that encourage synchronic doings, trade associations foster social cohesion among geographically dispersed producers and consumers.</p><a id="AN0144933216-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-14" title="Emerging Tension">Emerging Tension</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stage of "mobilization of peer firms and allies" is permeated by collectivism, yet it contains an emerging tension related to group boundaries (Figure 2, stage 2, emerging tension). As craft beer grew in popularity, it began to entice corporations and entrepreneurs seeking a quick profit—or in one craft brewer's words, "a bunch of business people pouring money into breweries, opening fancy brewpubs, who started cutting corners to get higher returns." Craft breweries feared that this type of newcomer would undermine their quality-oriented cause.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To manage this tension, the craft breweries' national association set formal standards for a brewery to be considered craft. These standards had three pillars: a maximum production volume, a maximum percentage of ownership by large corporations, and the types of ingredients that can be used in beer making. This standard-setting did not aim to create technological compatibility, as in the markets for electricity and VCRs ([19]; [34]). Instead, it aimed to shield craft breweries' collaborative market driving from the encroachment of corporate breweries. Through these standards, craft breweries restrict the types of breweries that can vote and participate as board members in their associations, two roles that may have enduring effects on market development by shaping commercial and regulatory standards ([91]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, promoting a shared cause and institutionalizing bonding opportunities are mobilization triggers that, despite emergent tensions, explain how peer firms go from shared constraints and dispersed action to a sense of collective identity, alongside their allies (Figure 2, stage 2, outcomes). The next section highlights how this identity translates into a form of collective action that departs from individualistic approaches to market driving.</p><a id="AN0144933216-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-15" title="Stage 3: Concerted Action of Peer Firms and Allies">Stage 3: Concerted Action of Peer Firms and Allies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Stage 3 refers to how a mobilized coalition of actors works together to drive the development of a market.

In collaborative market driving, firms suspend this wisdom. Instead, they exchange critical resources for promoting the entry and growth of peers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Limited know-how has long been a constraint for craft brewers to enter and stay in the beer industry. In response, trade associations and established craft breweries have devised initiatives to enhance newer producers' know-how. At trade conferences, prestigious craft brewers educate audiences of less seasoned peers on general business topics, from distributor selection to brewpub design, without charging speaking fees. In the annual program "Brewing the American Dream," pioneering craft brewery Boston Beer Company covers the expenses for a new craft brewer to visit its facilities and receive customized business advice from its executives.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond cooperation between geographically distant peers, our data show ample exchange of know-how among geographically close firms. Interestingly, this closeness does not seem to evolve into enclosed cliques, as may happen in some industries ([100]). Newcomers are welcomed, receiving critical business information, as this craft brewer notes:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">People who are planning to open a brewery come to guild meetings to learn about the trials and hiccups we've experienced. That saves them a lot of time; many of those guys don't have a lot of experience as entrepreneurs, at least not in the alcohol industry. So, we say, "these are your zoning laws." It's very intricate. There's even regulation for how many feet away from a church you gotta be. And we are a soundboard for a new person who wants to open a brewery. For example, two new breweries have been coming to our meetings for the past year. We've helped steer them away from locations that would have hindered their ability to grow. It's not easy to open a brewery. Every step of the way, you find a hurdle.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Craft breweries participate in a two-layer network, with local and distant peers. For new firms, spatially distant peers are useful as sources of generic know-how, such as brewpub design; in turn, local networks give these firms access to tailored information, such as how to navigate city regulation. This information improves newcomers' decisions about issues (e.g., location) that can make or break a brick-and-mortar business.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond the aid from established peers, upcoming producers consistently receive contributions from allied consumers. Specifically, consumers act as volunteers (Figure 2, stage 2, core processes), giving money and physical labor to help these firms deal with another of their historical constraints: limited financial resources. In crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter, many individuals give money for craft breweries to open and expand their operations. In our sample, consumers have made contributions that, summed with others, helped these breweries raise between $20,000 and $40,000, getting in return only mementos or personalized experiences such as private beer tours. As to physical labor, consumers volunteer at craft beer festivals in positions from trash collectors to beer pourers, receiving in return tickets to these festivals and T-shirts. Also in exchange for some souvenirs, consumers volunteer at craft breweries' production lines, as when a new craft brewery needed extra hands on its canning operation's first day.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers frequently provide firms with free resources. At times, they create products for themselves that are later commercialized by firms on a larger scale ([21]; [22]). At other times, when participating in brand communities, they give away ideas for the specific firm to which they feel attached ([18]; [78]; [88]). As allies in collaborative market driving, though, consumers form a more flexible pool of critical resources, which various firms (not just specific ones) can call on to respond to their business needs. The operation of this pool relies on the strong sense of collective identity between producers and consumers—result from the mobilizing efforts analyzed previously. The result of this mobilization is also clear in how these market actors collaborate to build a positive reputation for the collective of craft breweries. As shown next, this collaboration impacts both newer and older peers.</p><a id="AN0144933216-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-18" title="Building market reputation">Building market reputation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In individualistic approaches to market driving, firms focus on building their own brands ([46]). In collaborative market driving, this individualistic focus coexists with the goal of developing a reputation for the entire market category. This goal can hardly be accomplished without peers' adequate performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building this positive reputation is challenging when many producers lack the know-how to offer high-quality products reliably ([81]). To mitigate this historical challenge for craft breweries, local trade associations keep an eye on members that struggle to deliver expected quality levels, as this guild's director confides:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We help defray the cost of conferences for brewers.... We defray costs for everyone, but I make special invitations to those that I know are not doing a great job (chuckles). Part of the money we make at festivals goes for that.... If the first craft beer I ever taste is hideous, that forms my opinions about craft beers in general.There're licensed breweries in this state that the owners are enthusiastic about their beer, but their beer isn't always very good.... And some of them have been around a while. That doesn't help the [craft beer] industry.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In collaborative market driving, improving quality is a collective concern because peer firms seek to create a positive image for their market. This is necessary given the knowledge schema that informs the adverse preferences of mainstream beer consumers. Because of the flavor homogeneity of U.S. mass-produced beers, many consumers learned to expect all beers to taste similarly. This schema is tacit when Americans ask one another, "Do you like beer?" as if all beers tasted the same. In markets with a long history of heterogeneity such as cars, the question "Do you like cars?" makes little sense, as it is assumed that people may well like sedans while disliking compact vehicles. In the beer market, though, the many consumers who are unaware of the sheer diversity of flavors among craft beers transfer the single-taste schema they learned through their experiences with mass-produced beers to other products. Then, if a craft brewery makes a faulty product, they infer this product generally reflects the quality of craft beers. Given this, craft breweries' know-how exchange plays a nontrivial role in increasing consumers' chances of enjoying their first craft beer experiences, a decisive step in increasing demand for this product ([12]). This form of deploying collective resources, thus, drives markets by changing the economic actions of producers, which in turn impacts the composition and typical actions of consumers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite the ample exchange of economic know-how, many craft brewers occasionally face issues in their commercial efforts. A common one is erring in inventory forecasts in ways that impact consumer experience and sales. In response, craft breweries participate in another form of collective deployment of resources that centers on production supplies. Here, local networks are instrumental, as this craft brewer reveals:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Last month we ran out of oxygen, so I called [local brewery] and asked, "Do you have a tank we could borrow?" And they go, "Sure. The brewery's keys are hidden here; just go back and grab the tank." It's this sort of thing. If you're short in anything, you can always call other breweries.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Pooling supplies with local peers prevents craft breweries from losing sales and failing consumers with a lack of products and faulty services. In the long run, this economic cooperation aids these firms in their bid for creating a positive market reputation in their localities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To build the reputation of a new market, firms often enlist resources from influential market actors such as opinion leaders ([41]; [52]). In our context, mainstream consumers were key allies, providing resources that were critical to the firms leading the cause they learned to support. Specifically, allied consumers directly contribute to building and sustaining craft breweries' core competitive advantage: continual product innovation ([96]). This contribution usually happens through home brewing contests, as this fieldnote based on the first author's observations describes:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the typical format of home brewing contests, craft breweries partner with home brewing and craft beer clubs that invite members to send samples of their best homemade beers. These samples are judged, and the winning recipe is commercially brewed by the partner craft brewery—with winning consumers receiving no financial reward. Drawing on consumers' recipe ideas is so common that craft breweries' trade associations have formalized a process to do so. In craft beer competitions, craft breweries often compete in the "Pro-Am" category (short for Professional-Amateur). To participate in it, breweries can only enter recipes coming from their collaborations with consumers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When producers share high collectivism, as craft breweries do, they often restrain their access to novel knowledge, a critical factor in firms' ability to innovate continuously ([100]). By turning consumers into cocreators (Figure 2, stage 3, core processes), craft breweries and their trade association partially offset this tendency. These breweries do not look at the aggregate tastes of these consumers to cater to them, as in typical market-driven strategies, nor do they ignore these tastes, as in some market-driving strategies ([43]). Instead, these firms rely on these consumers as members of their innovation ecosystem who provide free suggestions. The deployment of this economic resource supports these breweries' market-driving goal by keeping product innovation as a competitive advantage over incumbents, thereby helping them to retain the lead in shaping mainstream consumer preferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To fully grasp this economic cooperation, it is worth unpacking how it benefits established breweries. By displaying generosity, they showcase their commitment to the craft beer revival. In turn, the recognition of this commitment by peers and allied consumer aids these larger players—some of which produce millions of beer barrels—to retain the right to claim the status of "craft." Nevertheless, collaborative market driving is not directed by a highly calculative mindset ([<a id="bib7up

Our data contain one such case, when a craft brewer sold a bottler to a peer for its cost value, only to learn that this firm later resold the machine with profit to another craft brewery. The seller learned about this at a trade conference when he incidentally met the equipment's second buyer. The seller stopped helping the opportunistic peer, but without taking further action such as telling other breweries about this violation. This case helps us identify limitations to collaborative market driving. Peers trust one another by default rather than as the result of dyadic ties built over time ([28]; [100]), but they will cut these ties if they realize a peer abused their initial goodwill.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It appears that opportunistic behavior is mitigated indirectly in collaborative market driving. The multilayer social network in which firms participate functions as a monitoring tool against actors who want to engage in repeated free riding. In addition, the openness of this network to newcomers plays a symbolic role in subduing purely self-oriented behavior. Observe how this craft brewer reflects on his adoption of the "a rising tide floats all boats" ethos after experiencing craft breweries' exchange of economic resources:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When we entered into the brewing business, I thought all right, "Here we go, this is a business. It's gonna be cutthroat, take children out of the living room." When we were still in the planning phase, I was at [craft beer festival], and I went around to all the local breweries and introduced myself. And then, the guys from [brewery name] just sort of said, "If you need anything, let us know." I didn't expect that.... And then, I needed something, and I called them, "Hey, can you help me with this?" And they go, "Sure, just stop by." It was yeast, I think. Later, I wanted to know about some distributors, and they go, "Here's your answer..." Since then, we've been able to help them a little bit. I remember the first time they asked us for help. I was like, "Yay! We're not just asking all the time anymore."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Instead of holding back or monetizing critical economic resources, the coalition of craft breweries, trade associations, and allied consumers more often pools these resources together, enabling firms to enter the market and build positive consumer perceptions. The goal and scope of this economic cooperation are broader than those in typical cases of interfirm collaboration centered on specific, time-bound projects ([98]). This cooperation also departs from individualistic approaches to market driving; in the latter, producers focus on creating strong reputations for their own brands ([43]); in the former, producers also prioritize the reputation of their peers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In sum, economic conversion involves the pooling and deployment of critical economic resources into initiatives that foster the entry of new peers to an industry and alter the actions of critical stakeholders, such as these same peers and consumers. However, as the craft beer market grew in economic import, craft breweries came into friction with regulations that had not been designed for these players but were, instead, aligned with market incumbents' interests.

In individualistic market driving, large firms usually engage in this kind of action by using their financial resources to hire well-paid lobbyists and make donations to political parties ([27]; [89]).

Craft breweries' trade associations took the lead in this regard by hiring professional lobbyists, as this association director reveals:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We felt that we <em>had</em> to hire a lobbying firm.... There's a limited amount of publications that legislators read, and then there's like a subscription email service. So, this firm can place our message there, and they know how to change it so that it makes sense to legislators. Not to mention they knew who in the House has an agenda of supporting small businesses like us.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For legislators, lobbyists are valuable to the extent they can translate the often-vague claims from constituents into useful information for policymaking decisions ([36]). For constituents, lobbyists' value derives from their ability to offer reliable access to political elites.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond lobbying, craft breweries' trade associations create goodwill with political elites by inviting them to events that can showcase craft breweries' quality and popularity. For example, the national association hosts a craft beer and food pairing reception annually to acquaint U.S. Congress members with its executives and leading craft brewers. Also, state guilds use the largest festivals they organize as a political tool. This guild's director explains:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One of our major events [<a id="bib6up

It pulls in retailers, wholesalers, brewers, and consumers. To be honest, promoting craft beer to the public is a byproduct. The primary purposes are fundraising for the guild's programs and profiling craft beer and craft breweries to the state legislature. We invite legislators and staffers to come for the expo; some are invited to a luncheon, others are invited to speak.... We do this event at that location on purpose, to show craft beer.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Such festivals bond producers and consumers with shared interests. Furthermore, by showcasing craft breweries' large following, these events help trade associations vividly display to political elites the electoral potential of being receptive to their legislative agenda.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Creating goodwill with political elites is important and often costly ([101]). Craft breweries' trade associations have been able to achieve this goal by harnessing two collective resources that they have fostered: the mobilization of peer firms and consumers as well as their rising economic power. This fieldwork memo, written as a summary of the first author's interactions with these associations' directors, gives more details:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The national trade association takes funds from the dues paid by the great proportion (70% in 2016) of brewers affiliated with it and the registration fees they pay for trade conferences. This combination has enabled this organization to step up from doing intermittent lobbying until the mid-2000s to allocating nearly $200,000 toward government affairs per year in the 2010s. Guilds, in turn, take funds primarily from the proceeds of the popular craft beer festivals they organize. Further, about 1/3 of them run membership programs in which consumers pay annual dues (e.g., $30) in exchange for perks (e.g., glassware).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Though the individual values of these dues are minor, they demonstrate the importance of cultivating a sense of collective identity among collaborative market drivers (Figure 2, stage 2, outcomes). When properly done, this cultivated identity can even lead market actors to behave in politically committed ways that are quite puzzling when compared with the waning civic engagement that has recently characterized many areas of social life ([80]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Put succinctly, the dimension of creating goodwill with political elites focuses on cultivating a sentiment of endearment with this powerful group to increase their receptivity to the claims of the peer firms. However, this may not translate into specific votes—and thus the need to work on the more pragmatic dimension of political conversion.</p><a id="AN0144933216-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-22" title="Pushing a legislative agenda">Pushing a legislative agenda</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This dimension focuses on getting specific bills passed rather than on enhancing lawmakers' receptivity to an interest group. As with creating goodwill with political elites, it also relies on market drivers' collective sense of identity and aggregate economic power.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Since the late 2000s, one critical policy issue has been the federal excise tax on beer. In the program "Climb the Hill," trade associations sponsored fly-ins for craft brewers to discuss the impact of this tax with legislators in Washington, D.C. For these meetings, craft brewers suspend their antagonism to corporate breweries. Trade associations instruct them to focus on how the excise tax hindered their potential to create the manufacturing jobs that have become so electorally relevant in the United States. In 2015, nearly 180 craft brewers met with their Congressional representatives to garner their support for a bill that passed in 2017 to lower said tax.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond producers, consumers also participate as activists (Figure 2, stage 3, core processes) to push specific bills. The national association runs the program "Support Your Local Brewery," with over 1.5 million registered consumers who receive calls to action about policy issues. These calls include instructions that also emphasize a moderate tone that consumers should use:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Please identify yourself by name and say you are a constituent and in which city or rural area you live. Ask the Representative to please oppose [bill number] because it will limit the ability of craft brewers to get their beer on the shelves of retailers and hence your ability to access [state] craft beer.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the number of consumers contacting representatives is unavailable, guild directors often reported this program's role in amplifying their political clout, as in this interview: "More than once, I've walked into a Congressman's office to talk about an issue, and they go, 'Okay, okay, I know what's going on. I'll support your agenda. Just ask your people to stop calling me. I've got it.'" This consumer political engagement is another point of distinction between collaborative market driving and typical cases of brand community, which center on the cocreation of products and services rather than on shaping policy ([88]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Pushing a legislative agenda has been vital in craft breweries' struggle to access more mainstream consumers. In a recent case, a state guild spent three years working with lobbyists and coordinating a series of grassroots tactics to expand craft breweries' production capacity without increasing their taxes. This guild's director chronicles:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first time, we tried to introduce the bill through our lobbyist, but we failed. Institutions resist change. You have to show the new bill is a better alternative. The second time, we asked essentially the same things, but we also did a whole campaign. We had a 300-people rally at the Capitol, which was the biggest rally for any commerce committee they've ever had. We activated not only our breweries but also the general public. We had people bussed in. Our bill sponsor talked before the group. We had [the mayor] talk. During all this, breweries and myself were doing the basic petition across the state. We've got 10,000 signatures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Collaborative market driving entails deploying collective resources into some initiatives that use formal communication channels with political elites and into other initiatives that dramatize the popular support for a cause. [69] explains that the mix of these political tools is what often creates the sense of merit and urgency required to turn such claims into policy changes. In this process, trade associations play a crucial role, bundling dispersed producers and consumers into a more cohesive political voice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Over time, this coalition of suprafirm entities, peer firms, and allied consumers has scored major political wins. Recall that regulations prohibited craft breweries from running brewpubs and mandated the use of distributors to sell beer in many states, despite incumbents' power over these intermediaries. By 2016, Georgia and Mississippi were the only states still forbidding craft breweries from on-premise beer sales. Moreover, this coalition has legalized home brewing in all states, an activity that often introduces new consumers to craft beer's flavors ([63]). This legalization also creates opportunities for more people to engage in the activity that has served as the primary incubator of craft breweries, thus promoting the entry of new market players in the coalition. Through political conversion, craft breweries have shaped regulation in ways that changed the composition and typical actions of multiple stakeholders.</p><a id="AN0144933216-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-23" title="Emerging tension">Emerging tension</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The emerging tension found in political conversion is political underrepresentation (Figure 2, stage 3, emerging tensions). For example, the dues paid by smaller craft breweries partly paid for the costs of the political campaign mentioned previously, when a guild passed a bill to expand craft breweries' production cap. However, the bill's main beneficiaries were two larger peers, who were close to reaching the cap. Smaller craft breweries raised their eyebrows at this process. But for the most part, this kind of tension is tempered by these larger peers' role in expanding the craft beer market. Smaller breweries have observed that larger peers' presence in mainstream retailers such as large grocery store chains are an entryway for more consumers into the craft beer world, many of whom become eventually interested in their local products. Furthermore, this tension is tempered by the role of smaller breweries in economic conversion. There, they are the main beneficiaries of what larger peers can provide.</p><a id="AN0144933216-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-24" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0144933216-25"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-25" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We compare our theorizing with prior marketing research to distill the main differences between collaborative and individualistic approaches to market driving.

This is the case in [85] study of automakers and [43] work on wineries; these firms drove their markets mostly through individualistic efforts to outdo peers. When some resources are scarce, though, firms may resort to marketing alliances as part of market-driving efforts, as often happens in the development of complex technologies ([86]). These alliances differ in degree from collaborative market driving. They are time-bound and tend to involve a select group of firms, often excluding peers. Under these conditions, the importance of suprafirm entities is situational, as when otherwise rival firms try to shape regulation as an interest group ([89]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By contrast, collaborative market driving is guided by a shared cause instead of a self-oriented vision. Inspired by our informants, we term this ethos "a rising tide floats all boats"— which reflects firms' focus on building a positive reputation for themselves and their peers. Research shows this kind of collective action often occurs among underresourced players, as in the dynamics leading to the growth of food trucks and community-supported agriculture in the United States ([25]; [97]). But it also occurs among more powerful producers, as when automakers worked with car enthusiasts to lobby for better roads and regulation in automobile's early days ([81]). This collaborative ethos rests on producers' <em>relative</em> lack of resources to shape critical market structures and behaviors, not on their absolute endowments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Precipitating sustained collective action requires time and effort ([73]; [74]). A suprafirm entity devoted to coordinating collaborative market driving can, thus, be critical (Table 1, penultimate line). Our research sheds light on a common form of such entities: trade associations. Typically, these actors lack bureaucratic tools (e.g., contracts) to coerce firms into certain behaviors. Instead, they shape markets by producing cultural templates for action ([92]), orchestrating a shared identity among producers, enlisting allies, and harnessing the resources of these actors into market driving. Trade associations seem to be well positioned to coordinate this strategy because of their presumed legitimacy as a representative of collective interests. Other suprafirm entities that often have such legitimacy, and therefore might alternatively be effective coordinators of collective firm action, include private consultants, consumer associations, and governmental and multilateral agencies ([68]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Collaborative market driving also shows how markets evolve when consumers systematically join forces with firms to defy an industry's status quo. Research on this topic points to the role of ideological affinities between firms and consumers, as when they form brand communities ([79]; [97]). However, ideas rarely translate spontaneously into sustained, organized action against dominant practices and actors. This form of action relies on pragmatic ways to create social cohesion among challengers, organize contestation, and secure resources for these tasks in the long term ([66]). Building on this view, our research deepens marketing theory by specifying mobilization triggers and types of resource conversion that mediate between ideologies and the collective action of peer firms and consumers to drive a market. In this form of action, consumers play various roles as allies, supporting multiple rather than single firms (Table 1, bottom line).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By marking the distinctions between individualistic and collaborative approaches to market driving, we answer [45] call for a systematization of how firms can shape market evolution. Recently, [43] moved in this direction by identifying differences in the "basis of competition"; specifically, they show that firms can drive markets through symbolic leadership in addition to through the more often discussed focus on technological disruption. Across the differences between symbolic and technological leadership, firms typically cooperate with multiple actors within and outside the supply chain, but they see their peers mostly as rivals. We extend this nascent typology of market driving by identifying differences in the "form of action"; we theorize how firms can drive markets by collaborating with peers, adding to the understanding of how firms do so through individualistic competition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To be sure, collaborative market driving does not exclude self-interest. By cooperating, firms can change markets to an extent they would be unlikely to do otherwise. In the craft beer case, even the largest craft breweries would struggle to shape policy, an arena in which their resources are hardly a match to those of their rival multinationals. Peers also cooperate because they jointly benefit from growing the visibility of their offering, a key factor in boosting the economic and cultural significance of their market positions ([42]). Thus, collaborative market driving is a collective strategy that includes but is not overtaken by self-interest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Relatedly, collaborative market driving does not mean an absence of producer hierarchies. In our context, there is a clear power difference between craft breweries that sell only in small towns and those with national distribution. In collaborative market driving, though, higher-power firms do not use their greater resources to oppress their peers, as would be typically the case in individualistic approaches to market driving ([86]). Instead, they allocate some resources to help peers thrive. In doing so, they inevitably assert their power, but looking at collaborative market driving only through the lens of self-interest obscures rather than illuminates this strategy. Of course, the prevalence of collaboration can change as market growth slows down. Future research could explore how this collaborative market driving may break down.</p><a id="AN0144933216-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-27" title="Transferability of theoretical insights">Transferability of theoretical insights</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our framework (Figure 2) is useful to explain other cases of market development. In theorizing market driving, [46], p. 47) note that this strategy is a matter of degree: "A business that greatly changes the composition of a market [and] the behaviors of most players would be classified as having driven the market to a greater extent than another business that caused only a small change in the behavior of a single player." The rise of U.S. craft breweries lies on the higher end of this continuum. It involves players that shaped much of the composition of the market and the behaviors of many economic and political actors; furthermore, these players did so with the odds stacked against them, using limited resources to confront powerful incumbents and alter adverse consumer preferences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We propose our framework has a strong explanatory fit with similar cases: firms that collectively drove markets to a high degree despite their fragmented economic and political power. Research has documented many such instances, as in the markets for organic food, grass-fed meat, and legal cannabis, all of which developed through the collective action of relatively small producers and allied consumers ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref181" title="5">5</a>]; [52]; [102]). Other exemplars are the growth of food trucks and the credit union movement ([25]; [67]). The early days of personal computers and nouvelle cuisine also involved peer firm collaboration in particular areas. For example, producers cooperated to create consumer awareness and interest in their offerings, the area where they individually lacked resources to drive market development ([81]). In short, our framework is useful in explaining the process of collective action when peer firms employ collaboration, more and less broadly, to drive markets to a high degree.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to contributing to market driving research, our work offers new insights on the formation of market heterogeneity, in particular to resource partitioning and organizational ecology theories. Often, work in these areas hold that markets tend to become dominated by large generalists that cater to the majority of consumers with mass-produced offerings, leaving unattended smaller segments of buyers who prefer more differentiated experiences (e.g., [13]; [37]). Market heterogeneity arises as entrepreneurs form market niches to cater to these segments that are beyond better-resourced incumbents' interests. In this view, the best strategy for this new set of firms is to remain in a sort of competitive quarantine, operating in market spaces without provoking retaliation of more powerful incumbents.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In contrast, collaborative market driving shows how markets become heterogeneous as underresourced firms jointly shift from a defensive to an offensive strategy. In this strategy, they do not simply find consumers with tastes that resonate with their differentiated offerings; instead, they shake deep-seated preferences to develop consumer demand. Moreover, they do not merely occupy market niches away from generalists' reach but rather move into generalists' turf, directly defying their dominance. The present research thus accounts for a more vigorous form of agency by underresourced new firms, deepening knowledge of the nature and extent of their competitive efforts and market influence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The conceptualization of collaborative market driving also informs the ongoing conversation on interfirm ties in marketing research. This literature has built a rich understanding of the vertical form of these ties, whereby sellers and buyers in a given distribution channel try to optimize their bilateral transactions (e.g., [38]; [55]; [62]; [93]). Much less studied are horizontal forms of market coordination, those involving firms positioned as sellers in a distribution channel. Work on horizontal coordination emphasizes time-bound interactions between a select group of peers; these interactions are regulated through formal contracts and oriented toward cost-sharing, as when firms form alliances to develop new products ([84]; [95]). By contrast, collaborative market driving refers to cooperation among a broad (vs. select) set of peer firms that are at the center of a broader coalition of actors who seek to develop a market. This cooperation relies on an informal (vs. formal) contract, safeguarded by a curated ideology and cohesive social networks, and enacted through a portfolio of initiatives that market actors devise to pursue their collective goal.</p><a id="AN0144933216-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-28" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our work can help managers assess when a collaborative approach to market driving is best suited. To organize this discussion, we offer a decision flowchart (Figure 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 3. Decision flowchart for collaborative market driving.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first managerial task is to pinpoint the critical constraints a firm would face in driving market development (Figure 3, box 1). These constraints can be classified as consumer- and producer-related. As to the first type, our work highlights adverse consumer preferences, but consumers may also have difficulty in evaluating the value of a novel offering ([43]; [60]). This is recurrent in the markets for foods and beverages, entertainment, and fashion, in which assessment of superiority tends to be subjective. As to producer-related constraints, we foreground limited know-how and financial resources, though these constraints also include insufficient social capital ([19]) and brand recognition ([81]) to attract customers to a new market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second managerial task is to assess whether the focal company has the resources to overcome these constraints (Figure 3, boxes 2 and 3). Often, firms do not have the means to develop a new market, even if products are clearly superior to existing offerings. This happened in the early days of radio broadcasting, personal computers, and cars ([59]; [81]). Peer firms lacked sufficient resources to create technological infrastructure and generate broad consumer awareness and interest. But single firms may be adequately endowed for market driving, as with the technology startups studied by [86]. In this scenario, we reason that individualistic market driving is more suitable for a firm to reap most of the rewards in the market it is developing (box 4). This firm can use orthodox competitive practices such as eliminating peers from the market and creating unique product attributes (e.g., a patented feature). The focal firm may also choose to use the form of individualistic action that [43] labels "systemic" market driving. While this form of market driving is not collaborative among peer firms, it does involve forging relationships with actors outside the value chain (especially media members) to create symbolic value for consumers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The next managerial task is to identify whether there is a pool of peer firms that jointly possess the necessary resources for market development (Figure 3, box 5). If not, the focal firm may need to develop ways to lower entry barriers to the market (boxes 6 and 7) to form a "mob." This focus was part of JVC's strategy to win the battle of VHS over Betamax ([19]). This firm facilitated the entry of other firms interested in producing VHS-based VCRs, while Sony tried to keep Betamax a proprietary technology. In such cases, collaborative market driving would involve some economic and political cooperation—before a focus on mobilization—to open up the market for other firms with overlapping interests.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As peers enter the market, our work points to the pivotal role of suprafirm entities and mobilization triggers in cultivating a shared cause, and the networks needed to translate it into actions (Figure 3, box 8). Once peer firms are mobilized, they can develop initiatives to deploy their collective resources in ways that help them overcome their constraints and thus build a viable competitive position in a new market (box 9). Managers should carefully consider and include potential allies in these mobilization triggers and deployment initiatives. Finally, when evaluating collaborative market driving, we advise the use of both firm- and market-centered metrics. Firm-centered metrics include the typical ones, such as growth in sales and profit. Market-centered metrics include increase in the overall size of the market category and the number of peers. A firm's overemphasis on its own market share may be counterproductive to the goal of developing a market where a set of peer firms can thrive.</p><a id="AN0144933216-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0144933216-29" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research conceptualizes collaborative market driving, the collective strategy through which firms consistently cooperate with their peers and other market actors to develop a market in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This research also highlights the role of trade associations as coordinators and consumers as allies in this strategy. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for firms interested in driving new markets when they lack adequate resources to do so individually. Together, these contributions help align mainstream marketing thought and practice with the often collective nature of market driving.

We present two challenges to the proposed view of marketing in the sharing economy. First, we argue that the critical feature of the sharing economy is not its crowdsourced nature, but rather its digital-economy nature, which means data are now considered the key factor of production that drives how markets are organized and operate. Second, the market environment for the sharing economy in emerging markets lacks the institutional basis found in developed markets, which creates unique consumer and firm problems. These two challenges change marketing within the sharing economy in ways important to practitioners and scholars.</p><a id="AN0138094831-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094831-2" title="The Sharing Economy and the Digital Economy">The Sharing Economy and the Digital Economy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[<a id="bib2up

The authors propose five defining attributes of the sharing economy: temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply. In this definition and Table 2 in their article, they place "crowdsourced supply" as a foundational element of the sharing economy. We challenge this view.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Rental businesses, which allow consumption sharing and provide temporary access to resources, have existed for a long time.

With data as the key factor of production, digital technologies provide exceptional insights and the capability of matching suppliers and buyers to efficiently meet buyers' idiosyncratic needs without ownership transfer. Ride-sharing companies such as Uber are able to achieve this matching capability through digital technology that allows Uber to access massive consumer usage behavior data, identify potential consumer demand through data analytics, and efficiently match consumer demand with available cars. Historically, this was not possible for traditional car rental companies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1 summarizes how this quality of the sharing economy changes several important aspects of marketing proposed by [<a id="bib2up

The authors acknowledge this shift, but we believe it is worth deeper consideration. For example, one of leading ride-sharing companies in China, Caocao Chuxing, owns all its cars and employs all its drivers ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref4" title="5">5</a>]). Furthermore, all the cars owned by Caocao are made by its parent company, the car manufacturer Geely. Geely, the largest Chinese private carmaker and the owner of Swedish car brand Volvo, set up the rideshare business Caocao in 2015. As an example of the power of digital assets, by analyzing passengers' usage behavior data on where and when they use the rideshare service, Caocao has been able to improve rideshare services and even offer additional product delivery services. For example, consumers can hail a Caocao driver to pick up and deliver a product (e.g., a document, a key, a cake, flowers) within the same city very quickly. More importantly, Caocao collects massive real time Internet-of-things (IOT) data from all its cars to monitor driver behavior and automobile performance on the platform. These data help Geely improve its innovation process and design better cars by observing customer frustrations and unmet needs during vehicle use.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The tremendous value of data from rideshare platforms has started to attract other upstream firms in the transportation industry to this market. For instance, the German automotive part maker Bosch recently acquired the ride-sharing startup SPLT ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref5" title="4">4</a>]). The massive data from Caocao and SPLT help Geely and Bosch better understand both their end-customer behaviors and product performance and manage their innovation processes more efficiently. These companies have realized that user behavior data from temporary access on rideshare platforms is much richer relative to what can be uncovered when a car is sold in the classical economy. It is difficult for traditional car manufacturers or automotive part makers to know when, where, and in which context a consumer has mobility needs. It is also difficult for them to collect IOT data to monitor the automobile or automotive part performance without individual car owners' authorization. Sharing platforms now have unparalleled access to detailed user behavior and IOT data that traditional sellers could never have. Thus, it is not surprising that more upstream manufacturers and service providers have begun to vertically integrate with sharing platforms. This phenomenon contrasts with [<a id="bib2up

In fact, traditional firms are increasingly embracing the sharing economy by vertically integrating into the downstream sharing platform so they can better appropriate the value generated from platform data. Meanwhile, since the sharing platform has unprecedented access to user behavior data, building a trustworthy platform brand is a critical new issue for brand management.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, to capture the essence of the sharing economy, we think it is more appropriate to define the sharing economy as an important type of digital economy that employs data as the key production factor to provide users with temporary access to tangible and intangible resources to efficiently meet their highly individualized needs.</p><a id="AN0138094831-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094831-3" title="The Unique Market Environment for the Sharing Economy in Emerging Markets">The Unique Market Environment for the Sharing Economy in Emerging Markets</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From [<a id="bib2up

However, the marketing environment for the sharing economy is quite different in emerging markets. A unique feature of the market environment for the digital economy in emerging markets such as China is that the market begins the digitization process while it is still in the process of industrialization ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref8" title="1">1</a>]). In contrast, in developed countries, the digitization process started after industrialization and is thus built on it. The most important implication of this timing difference is that without going through decades of industrialization, emerging markets do not have the solid and highly specialized foundation of market institutions (e.g., legal systems strictly protecting property rights) on which the digital economy is built in developed countries.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One critical role of such market institutions is to engender trust and reduce the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. In emerging markets in which the industrialization process is still underway, almost every industry is highly fragmented and has numerous firms—many with inferior quality and unknown reputation. Legal systems are not strong enough to enforce trustable market behavior, which makes it very difficult for buyers to trust and purchase from sellers. This distinctive market feature means that sharing economy companies in developing economies first need to build consumer trust.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Compared with the ownership transfer model in the traditional nonsharing economy, the temporary access model of the sharing economy makes buyers deal with different products and/or service providers for each transaction. Given this heterogeneity, firms need to offer innovative business models to help shape the new institutional environment and create unique value for different stakeholders during various marketing processes, such as those examined in [<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref9" title="2">2</a>].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As we summarize in Table 1, trust is the key market barrier in emerging markets. The critical role of the sharing economy firms in these markets is to serve as trust builders and market makers by proposing innovative business models and building a trustable and reputable brand to improve the customer experience. In general, sharing platforms have used two models to build trust in emerging markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first model for the sharing platforms to build trust in emerging markets is <em>self-ownership</em>. One good example is Shouqi Limousine &amp; Chauffeur, another leading ride-hailing player in China. Its business model is different from the crowdsourced supply model adopted by Uber and its biggest rival in China, Didi Chuxing. Shouqi Limousine &amp; Chauffeur owns its fleet of cars and provides only a few car models, which helps the platform reduce service heterogeneity for a ride-hailing customer. Founded in September 2015, the platform's parent company, Shouqi, has more than 60 years of history and is now the leading Chinese company providing transportation services for major state and foreign affairs events and VIPs. Shouqi has become the most trusted brand in the industry. Shouqi Limousine &amp; Chauffeur uses a brand extension strategy to leverage this strong brand equity from its parent company, hires all the drivers directly, and trains them to be service professionals (using training approaches from its parent company). This self-ownership model ensures consistent and high-quality service, which helps build trust among its customers. Shouqi Limousine &amp; Chauffeur's reputable brand image and high-quality service allow it to charge premium prices and appropriate value while serving its mid- to high-end customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second model for the sharing platform to build trust is to serve as a highly <em>integrated service provider</em> instead of a pure matching service model. In some industries, such as the home-sharing market, it can be difficult for sharing platforms such as Airbnb to provide their own homes to satisfy consumers' idiosyncratic demands; as a result, they tend to adopt the crowdsourced supply model. However, emerging markets must resolve the market trust issue for buyers and sellers; to do so, local home-sharing providers use a highly integrated service provider model that differs from the pure matching service model their Western counterparts operate. A typical example is Xiaozhu, one of the leading home-sharing providers in China. Founded by Chi (Kelvin) Chen and Liantao (Tarry) Wang (one of the co-authors of this commentary) in 2012, Xiaozhu has over 800,000 listings in more than 700 cities and destinations all over the world as of 2019.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the Chinese home-sharing market, trust and safety are the key issues for both homeowners and consumers, so Xiaozhu centered its business model on these issues from the very beginning. In addition to the typical two-way rating system adopted by its Western counterparts like Airbnb, Xiaozhu introduced multiple mechanisms, including smart door locks with facial recognition to prevent unauthorized tenants and enhance trust. The firm also collaborated with third-party companies such as Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial Services, which provides the private Zhima credit score system, so homeowners can screen out potential clients with bad credit history. Home-sharing service buyers also face severe uncertainty and trust issues about sellers. Homes in China are more likely to have lower hygiene and safety standards than U.S. or European homes, so steps are required to raise their quality. In April 2018, Xiaozhu launched an offline service center to provide such integrated service solutions for homeowners, mostly in expensive popular tourism destinations. The firm analyzes customers' behavior data (e.g., browsing, renting, review data) and provides such solutions as amateur host mentoring, interior design, photo shooting and cleaning services, and smart home management systems for homeowners in order to increase buyers' trust in the home-sharing suppliers on its platform. This heavy asset, highly integrated service model is quite different from the light asset, pure matching service model adopted by Airbnb and is more easily accepted by the suppliers and buyers in an emerging market environment like China. It also allows Xiaozhu to appropriate the value generated from other services.</p><a id="AN0138094831-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0138094831-4" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We believe it is important for future research in marketing to consider two important and overlooked features of the sharing economy. First, marketing should treat the sharing economy as an important type of digital economy. The data generated by the sharing service can be analyzed to determine how they create value for different stakeholders such as consumers, firms, and society and thus influence the whole value chain of an industry. Second, marketing should study the sharing economy from both the developed market and emerging market perspectives and examine how the market institution environment shapes the need for different business models to address consumer pain points and open these markets to serve user demand.</p><a id="AN0138094831-5"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0138094831-5" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Yubo Chen acknowledges the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant 71532006, 71325005, and 91746302 and China Ministry of Education Project for Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities Grant 16JJD630006.</em></p><a id="AN0138094831-6"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0138094831-6" title=" References  "> References  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em> ChenYubo (2018), "Take the Historic Opportunity to Develop the Digital Economy," People's Daily(June 4),<a href="http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2018-06/04/nw.D110000renmrb_20180604_4-16.htm">http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2018-06/04/nw.D110000renmrb%5f20180604%5f4-16.htm</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em> EckhardtGiana M.HoustonMark B.JiangBaojunLambertonCaitRindfleischAricZervasGeorgios (2019), "Marketing in the Sharing Economy," Journal of Marketing, 83 (5), 5–27.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  G20 Summit in China (2016), "Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative," Available at:<a href="http://www.g20chn.org/English/Documents/Current/201609/P020160908736971932404.pdf">http://www.g20chn.org/English/Documents/Current/201609/P020160908736971932404.pdf</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  MarshallAarian (2018), "The Ride-Hailing Business Is Now Way Bigger Than Uber and Lyft," Wired (February 28), https://<a href="http://www.wired.com/story/ride-hailing-business-uber-lyft-sony-bosch/">www.wired.com/story/ride-hailing-business-uber-lyft-sony-bosch/</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  RenRebbecaDuChen (2019), "Volvo's Owner Geely Is Running a Ride Hailing Service in China," Pingwest(May 29), https://en.pingwest.com/a/1996.</em></p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By Yubo Chen and Liantao (Tarry) Wang</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Reported by Author; Author</p><div><hr width="25%" noshade="noshade"><span class="medium-normal">Copyright of Journal of Marketing is the property of American Marketing Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Finally, Table 1 outlines some of the concerns, limitations, and caveats that often arise for a given question, source, or method. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list by any means. I elaborate on concerns about text sources and dictionaries noted in Table 1 in the sections that follow.</p><a id="AN0140321871-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321871-3" title="Concerns About Text Sources">Concerns About Text Sources</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Let's examine some concerns from Table 1 in more detail. Starting with data sources, there are four crucial, yet often overlooked, aspects of text analytics in marketing. One question about a sample is whether it is representative of the market to which we project. A key fact is that only a small proportion of consumers provide open-ended text spontaneously or when asked. Given this, there are good reasons to be wary of nonresponse bias as well as motivations other than simply providing feedback. For example, product reviews may be written in response to previous reviews, resulting in bias and a form of intracorpus autocorrelation (e.g., where the sentiment of one review is directly correlated with the sentiment of one or more previous reviews). In most cases, such autocorrelation cannot be solved, and analysts should simply be aware of how it may have affected a corpus in which contributions are public and sequential. Methods that assume independent sampling units (e.g., a t-test between time slices) are inappropriate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, if particularly large corpora are available, the dynamics of intracorpus ratings may be amenable to time series modeling, such as modeling the lag effect of previous reviews on subsequent reviews. As for nonresponse bias, depending on the data source, it may be possible to model nonresponse as a function of other data (for instance, using logistic regression with response as the outcome). This might be paired with sample weighting, targeted sampling, changes in survey design, or, more simply, qualitative examination of customers' reasons for nonresponse.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A second issue arises when considering combinations of sources that tend to vary dramatically in their length, quality, linguistic structure, clarity of content, and possibly in the direction of sentiment. For example, an online blog review may be quite lengthy and focused on facts rather than sentiment, whereas a shopping site review may be shorter and emotional. Customer support records may be negative because they typically arise in the context of problems. Tweets or other social media comments may be extremely short and use highly abbreviated text. This content issue interacts with questions about the sample because different groups within a population may use different platforms. Thus, for example, younger respondents may generate structurally different text than older respondents because of the platforms they use. Sentiment asymmetry is also common; reviews may be much more specific in one direction than another. For example, we might find that positive comments mention product details while negative comments are frustratingly generic or global.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A general way to address this problem is to separate analyses by source, even if the analyses themselves are identical, and to avoid trying to get a single "top line" score—at least at the beginning of the analysis. For example, one might analyze survey open ends separately from online reviews and present parallel results to compare and contrast the findings. A side benefit of this is that different sources may be amenable to differing marketing interventions and thus results are likely to be more directly applicable. After examining each source separately, one might decide to combine the data, adding codes for the original sources. This would allow the data to be disaggregated or modeled according to source in later analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third, related issue concerns attribution from the text to a product or service. We might hope that consumers will unambiguously identify a product; however, this is rare. Instead of the useful comment "My Acme SuperCam 9510 takes excessively pixelated images in night mode," we are more likely to get "Acme stinks at night." Why is this a problem? First, product managers will want to know how their separate products are performing. Second, if sentiment changes, stakeholders will want to know why. Did a new product introduction or a marketing campaign cause sentiment to change? Unless a product can be unambiguously identified, it will be difficult to assess the focus and potential links to marketing activities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For this problem, there are two common solutions. One is to use human raters to assign the most likely product (or products) according to contextual evidence, such as references to features that would imply a particular product. Another solution, when large samples are available, is to begin with human ratings and then scale those by using supervised learning and classification, training a machine learning model that will classify new text similarly. This will pose further questions about machine learning, such as the stability of a model as new offerings are introduced, but those diverge from our central discussion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A fourth and often-overlooked ethical consideration with text comments is that they frequently contain personally identifiable information (PII). For instance, a customer may reply to an open-ended question to complain about a problem and leave contact information. It is best to treat all raw text—even if collected from third party sources—as PII, and to have a system for data retention and for auditing and removing PII before sharing with extended team members. For example, names, email addresses, company names, and so forth, might be replaced with placeholders or anonymized identifiers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across all of these challenges, in general, I recommend actually <em>reading</em> samples of the text used in the analysis. One way to do this is with a weekly "comments hour" in which a team reads randomly selected comments. This can be a fun way to listen to customers, to surface issues with data quality, to suggest new research questions, and to involve team members from different disciplines to understand and contribute to the process. In one case, I recall that a review of open-ended comments revealed a crucial error in survey programming that resulted in questions about product experience only being asked only of nonusers. This was discovered by reading comments, in which a few respondents said that they were surprised to be asked about the product. Luckily, this weekly check discovered the error quite early, before sampling was completed. If we had only checked the data post hoc, all comments would have been unusable—or worse, the error might not have been detected and analysis would have led to very incorrect conclusions.</p><a id="AN0140321871-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321871-4" title="Concerns Related to Dictionaries and Sentiment">Concerns Related to Dictionaries and Sentiment</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As marketers, we are usually concerned with understanding the sentiment of customers' text comments.

More complex natural language processing is possible, but the difficulty and required corpus sizes make that more exceptional than common, at least for now.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Unfortunately, dictionary usage poses several serious concerns. I set aside the well-known issues of N-grams (e.g., where "not good" may be coded as an omitted stop word + "good"). As [<a id="bib1up

For example, I once worked on cloud infrastructure products, yet "cloud" is often generically coded in sentiment dictionaries as having negative sentiment. The solution to this problem depends on the severity in one's domain. In the simplest form, it might involve auditing the scoring of comments and adjusting a dictionary. In more complex cases, it could involve construction of custom dictionaries, with raters or customers in one's domain providing the dimensional scores. Marketing scholars and practitioners should be willing to undertake such dictionary construction in order to generate more valid results (see [<a id="bib6up

Dictionaries are often created by crowdsource or teams of qualitative ratings staff, yet those constitute a different sample than our respondents. Consider high-sentiment terms such as "wicked," "sick," "sexy," "bomb," "slick," "shiny"—the underlying sentiment varies by sample demographics, region, dialect, and product category. This common mismatch in language between dictionary raters and one's customer base poses validity and ethical concerns. If a dictionary does not appropriately capture the sentiment in language used by minority or other groups in your population, you will be systematically misrepresenting or failing to listen to their voices. When text analytics are used for direct marketing, recommendation engines, promotions, and the like, this may result, at best, in inefficient targeting; at worst, it may lead to severe and biased inequity for underrepresented groups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Standard dictionaries are often limited to scoring a word on a bipolar, positive and negative dimension. Comments may be averaged to yield a single −1 to +1 score that is deceptively analogous to traditional customer satisfaction (CSat) and likelihood-to-recommend (LTR) metrics. Yet unlike a CSat or LTR survey item, text sources may be susceptible to rapid change: reviews trail off as a product is in market, an ad may create a surge of social media comments, a news story may lead to social media posts being "ratioed" (flooded by negative comments as a form of protest), and so forth. Relying on a text-based tracker may lead to perpetually searching for explanations that reflect little more than seasonal or one-time changes in sample and source composition, possibly unrelated to any determinable structural change in latent sentiment. For example, a one-time campaign (e.g., a Super Bowl ad) may lead to transient, but not permanent, changes in the sample and sources.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, sample composition and related vocabulary may change seasonally. I once observed survey results (from a third party) that presented surprising data about college student behavior, such as finding that very few college students had taken classroom notes in the most recent week. It turned out the survey had fielded in July in the United States, and the students had in fact been asked about the previous week—when most of them would have been on summer vacation. For both of these problems—transient effects and seasonality—the solution is to examine results longitudinally but resist establishing a tracker or specific tracking metrics (such as "80% positive") until you have an extended understanding of seasonality and the frequency of one-time perturbations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To make informed decisions about marketing strategy, I have found it especially interesting to examine multidimensional sentiment analysis (MDSA), which scores a product, service, or (especially) brand on the valence and intensity of multiple dimensions, such as surprise, anger, delight, and trust (consumer researchers may think about the PANAS scale). Do negative comments reflect generic problems, or are customers actually <em>angry</em>? In the positive direction, is the sentiment weak, or do we provoke <em>joy</em>? I show next how such dimensions can be used with traditional (and somewhat old school) perceptual maps to inform strategy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">International markets may intensify these concerns. At a practical level, there are fewer and often lower-quality dictionaries available for languages other than English. Questions of dialect may be more important in other languages, and we will have different concerns about sources and samples. Experience shows that different cultures have varying sentiment anchors and use different dimensions. For example, a term such as "OK" might be neutral or negative in one context, but positive in another. Cultures vary in the terms they use, and some cultures use highly positive or negative terms much more often than others do. Some cultures have norms of polite and somewhat exaggerated enthusiasm while others have norms of expressive restraint. Thus, exceptionally positive or relatively negative or neutral comments may reflect cultural norms rather than product experience. In-person qualitative research may be needed to understand the relationship between comments and actual experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Again, an analyst should always inspect and audit the data, with the view that dictionaries themselves are imperfect data. Second, separate the analyses by language or region. If you plan to do a market expansion to, say, Japan or India or Germany, do not expect an easy transition of analytics to the new languages. Moreover, it would be unwise to expect similar base rates in sentiment in those locations as in U.S. English comments. I recommend two practices here: first, because the markets are different sources, conduct parallel analyses as noted previously. Second, avoid the temptation to compare regions or to assert, for example, that "customers in Germany are less [or more] satisfied." Understand each market on its own terms and compared to its own baseline at the beginning of the observation period. Over time, you will be able to compare it with this baseline.</p><a id="AN0140321871-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=22&amp;sid=00898d6b-1759-4e8c-975a-bf861ad6a303%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0140321871-5" title="A Suggested Start">A Suggested Start</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the marketer new to text analytics, I recommend the following path:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal"> As for any analytics problem, make the business question as crisp as possible. Exactly what question are you trying to answer? How will your data be used by marketing decision makers? How will the text analytics result assist?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Ideally, before tackling your data, build out a skeleton analysis using freely available text as a proxy data set (i.e., a practice data set that mimics some properties of your expected data). This will help separate the basic </span><em>mechanics</em><span class="medium-normal"> of the process from the </span><em>details</em><span class="medium-normal"> or idiosyncrasies of your target data. Parse the proxy data to imitate the structure you expect, such as sample size, length of comments, the number of products or brands, and so on. In a subsequent section, I describe an example using Project Gutenberg texts. Proxy analysis can also help you determine whether your question (Step 1) will be answerable. You can use it to mock up example results to discuss with stakeholders. This will usually identify gaps in the planned analyses, which can be rectified prior to beginning the actual analyses.</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> When your basic analyses have been demonstrated with proxy data, bring in real data. Start with a single data source, such as online reviews or comments from a CSat tracking survey. Longer text is better, because it affords more opportunity to detect sentiment and to clearly identify products or brands. It will also be easier to compare with automated scoring when auditing results. If you intend to do statistical modeling or machine learning, setting aside a random portion (perhaps a third) of the data to use as a holdout sample for validation is idea</span></li></ul></div></div></div></form></body></html>
