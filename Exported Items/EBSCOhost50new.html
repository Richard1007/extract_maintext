The authors analyze 99,451 sales pitches on a livestream retailing platform and match them with actual sales transactions. Results reveal that each emotional display, including happiness, uniformly exhibits a negative U-shaped effect on sales over time. The maximum sales resistance appears in the middle rather than at the beginning or end of sales pitches. Taken together, the results show that in one-to-many screen-mediated communications, salespeople should sell with a straight face. In addition, the authors derive closed-form formulae for the optimal allocation of the presence of a face and emotional displays over the presentation span. In contrast to the U-shaped effects, the optimal face presence wanes at the start, gradually builds to a crescendo, and eventually ebbs. Finally, the study shows how to objectively rank salespeople and circumvent biases in performance appraisals, thereby making novel contributions to people analytics. This research integrates new types of data and methods, key theoretical insights, and important managerial implications to inform the expanding opportunity that livestream e-commerce presents to marketers to create, communicate, deliver, and capture value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: deep learning; emotions; face detection; livestream e-commerce; salesperson effectiveness</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Livestream retailing augments traditional go-to-market strategies by reaching consumers via screen-mediated sales presentations for a variety of products. Amazon Live, Facebook Live, Taobao Live, and QVC serve as prominent exemplars. This type of retailing blends technology and marketing: the technology integrates video stream broadcast platforms, electronic payment systems, and forward and reverse logistics for efficient delivery and hassle-free returns, and the marketing combines entertainment and retailing, enhances reach via influencer marketing, shortens the purchase journey to the duration of the sales presentation, and permits value capture via innovative payment plans. In a typical video sales pitch, a host (salesperson) nudges a prospective customer through the purchase funnel by building awareness of an item's features, benefits, price, and discounts, as well as instilling urgency to buy. For example, on Taobao Live, which reaches over 37 million Chinese viewers monthly, top influencer Wei Ya helped Procter &amp; Gamble accelerate its customers' journey from awareness to purchase and Tesla generate customer leads ([19]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The continuous stream of sales presentation videos can be captured using advanced computing capabilities ([40]; [59]). Using video footage, marketing scientists can apply artificial intelligence technologies to automatically detect a salesperson's face in each frame, extract emotional expressions, and relate them to actual customers' behavioral data —all unobtrusively at a large scale— to generate novel insights ([34]), thereby augmenting the sparse knowledge on the business impact of emotional displays.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Recent studies have investigated the effects of emotional displays on various marketing metrics. For example, [50] offer the first study to automatically extract the emotions of joy and surprise that viewers experience when watching television commercials and then relate these emotions to attention and ad avoidance behavior. Similarly, [32] examine the impact of emotional displays on sales using the Facial Action Coding System ([13]) to categorize a set of emotions (e.g., happiness, surprise, disgust) based on facial expressions of viewers watching movie trailers, compute the average watching intention for each movie trailer, and relate it to box-office revenues. They find that viewers' emotional displays of happiness positively influence both watching intentions and box-office revenues. However, although [32] incorporate prospective consumers' emotional displays into their study, the role of emotional displays on the seller side of the exchange dyad remains an unexplored cue that shapes consumers' purchases. Indeed, in their survey of the literature on emotions, [<a id="bib3up

Specifically, we address the following knowledge gaps:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal"> Do salespeople's emotions in livestream presentations impact sales? If so, to what extent?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> How do the effects of emotions vary over an item's presentation span?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> What is the optimal allocation of face presence and emotions over the presentation span?</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To answer these and related questions, we collaborate with a livestream retailer that broadcasts television shows 24 hours each day of the week, deploys salespeople to deliver live sales presentations of hedonic products, receives payments by credit cards, and ships orders by mail. A typical show lasts one hour and presents about eight items. We analyze the video data consisting of 62.32 million frames over two years. To put this scale in perspective, this footage exceeds two million 30-second TV ads. Then, we apply two machine-learning algorithms: real-time face detection ([56]) and real-time emotion classification ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref11" title="1">1</a>]). Specifically, the face detection algorithm discovers the presence or absence of a face in every frame of the video, while the emotions classifier (based on a convolutional neural network with rectified linear unit activation) assigns probabilities to the facial expressions in each frame with a face. Thus, we unobtrusively extract the display of emotions of each salesperson in one-to-many screen-mediated marketing communications in consumer markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, across 99,451 sales pitches, we match the salespeople's six emotional displays —happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust— to how long each item was shown, the product category to which it belongs, the number of units sold, the price charged, and whether shipping fees were waived. Finally, we extend marketing mix models on two frontiers: the inclusion of emotional displays and salespeople's effectiveness. We emphasize that the literature on marketing mix models is vast, as is the literature on emotions; however, they do not overlap. This study bridges the two distinct domains.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our analysis of large-scale video data shows that salespeople's emotions negatively impact sales across all six emotions, including happiness. The magnitude of sales decline across all the emotions is.47%, which is more than double the free-shipping effect (.20%). Happiness constitutes more than one-third of the total sales decline. Thus, we uncover a new maxim: sell with a straight face (i.e., reduce facial expressions).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, the level of the optimal face presence reduces over the initial 10% span, then gradually increases as the presentation progresses, and subsequently tapers down in the last 15% span. Finally, most marketing mix models ignore the role of the sales force (e.g., [<a id="bib2up

Consequently, companies are limited in their insights into an <em>individual</em> salesperson's effectiveness. By contrast, the proposed framework uses person-specific dummy variables to estimate individual salesperson's impact, yielding valuable information on salespeople's performance, which circumvents managers' cognitive biases (e.g., homophily) in recognizing excellence and identifying candidates for retraining, thus contributing to people analytics in a sales setting. Next, we describe the conceptual background needed to interpret the empirical results.</p><a id="AN0154071463-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071463-2" title="Conceptual Background">Conceptual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Facial expressions are social displays that a sender strategically deploys to elicit a desired response from a receiver ([11]; [15]). In other words, facial expressions are "declarations that signify our trajectory in a given social interaction, that is ... what we would like the other to do" ([15], p. 130). They are social communicative moves that serve as "tools for social influence" ([11], p. 393).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A sender may mask true intentions. The onus is, therefore, on the receiver to decipher the sender's intent. The Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model ([51], [52]; [53]) asserts that buyers scrutinize the seller's expressions in commercial exchanges in an attempt to discern the seller's strategic intentions. For example, [57] show that sellers sporting a broad smile during an encounter are perceived as less competent and that perceived incompetence is more likely to be evident among prevention-focused customers and in high-risk consumption settings. Furthermore, their field study in a crowdfunding context reveals that a project creator with a broad smile is perceived as less competent, which reduces the total amount of money pledged for a project, the total number of large-scale donations made by backers, and the average amount of money pledged per backer. Similarly, [10] find that displays of intense happiness (e.g., a broad smile) by customer-facing employees can undermine trust and reduce satisfaction with the product.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[44], [45], [46]) provides a theoretical explanation for <em>why</em> receivers are likely to draw certain inferences with respect to a sender's facial expression, and the EASI model offers clues on <em>how</em> receivers are likely to react to the cue. Salespeople's expressions elicit customers' inferences about sellers' characteristics such as competence, trustworthiness, and persuasive intent. Such inferences, in turn, impact customers' purchasing behaviors. Drawing on extant theory, Table 1 presents the seller's facial expressions, intent, consumers' inferences about sellers, and consumers' action tendency with examples. According to [53], consumers' action tendencies are to (<a id="bib1up

First, positive facial expression (i.e., happiness) invokes the action tendency to move against. In a competitive buyer–seller exchange setting, a seller's happiness expression engenders consumers' inference that the seller is gaining an advantage, thereby reducing the seller's trustworthiness as well as consumers' purchasing tendency ([51], [52]; [53]) — a finding consistent with [57] that a seller's broad smile results in the inference of low competence and the action tendency of reduced buying activity. Second, negative facial expressions (i.e., sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) invoke the action tendency to move away. For instance, a seller's sadness expression in a selling context invokes the consumers' inference of garnering empathy as an attempt to lower their guard, which can be off-putting to consumers, who might then either ignore or avoid the seller. Consistent with this expectation, [10]) show that the display of sadness by frontline employees undermines trust and lowers satisfaction. Last, surprise can be either a positive or negative facial expression: consumers can infer that the seller is trying to garner attention, which invokes the action tendency to either move toward or move against, depending on whether consumers believe the expression is appropriate.</p><a id="AN0154071463-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071463-3" title="Livestream Retail Analytics Framework">Livestream Retail Analytics Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The proposed framework circumvents limitations such as simulated interactions in laboratory studies, survey-based studies relying on self-reports, manual observation and coding of facial displays, small sample sizes, limited set of emotional displays, and lack of business metrics as the response variable. For example, [25] investigate the impact of service representatives' happiness expressions on subjects in lab settings (using trained student actors). [17] conduct surveys with airline passengers' assessments of flight attendants, and [27] rely on surveys completed by sales managers self-reporting their own ability to perceive their salespeople's emotions. [42] manually evaluates a small sample of bank employees' smiles in salesperson–customer service encounters. These studies lack the full spectrum of emotional displays and sales performance as the response. [26], a notable exception, seek to understand the content effects on sales. Specifically, they analyze a small sample of 275 sales pitches from Home Shopping Network and incorporate minute-by-minute cumulative sales; however, they ignore the role of facial expressions. To circumvent the aforementioned limitations, we develop a framework that unobtrusively collects nonsimulated market interactions, does not rely on self-reports, does not require manual observation or coding of facial displays, involves a large sample size, covers a broad spectrum of six emotional displays, and, most importantly, uses sales transactions as the response variable.

For every second of the video footage, we select a frame, convert it to grayscale, and present it to a pretrained OpenCV frontal face detection model based on the Haar cascade algorithm ([56]). For each detected face, the grayscale frame bounded by the face's region of interest is forwarded to an emotion classification model to infer the emotional state of the salesperson by producing probabilities for happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. We classify emotional displays using a pretrained mini-Xception model developed by [<a id="bib1up

The salesperson hosting the show presents information on products and encourages viewers to place orders by telephone. Each show lasts for 60 or 120 minutes, is planned weeks in advance, and contains live sales pitches of items (i.e., not scripted or prerecorded). Besides selling, the salespeople attempt to build parasocial relationships with viewers so that they feel a bond with virtual personalities analogous to those with television celebrities or news anchors ([49]).</p><a id="AN0154071463-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071463-14" title="Data">Data</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our direct-to-consumer retailer sells items from two product categories using 23 hosts as salespeople.

neural networks to detect the presence of a person's face in a Kickstarter crowdfunding video and show empirically that the presence of a human face makes a difference in shaping the desired funding

But does it impact sales? If so, to what extent? Our study answers these questions. The estimate of.338 in Table 4 (Model 2) means that sales increase by.34% when a face is present, an effect common to all the hosts. For a specific salesperson, say salesperson 15, the impact of sales pitch is  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mn>.338</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>.418</mn></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>.756</mn></math>  , which means sales increase by.76%.

Happiness and anger induce the largest sales decline; surprise the smallest. Summing across these emotions, the magnitude of total sales decline (.47%) is more than twice the free-shipping effect (.198%).

Time-varying sales impact of emotional displays without dynamic time warping.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">What accounts for the negative sales impact? As discussed in the "Conceptual Background" section, sellers' emotional displays trigger buyers' inference and action tendencies. Specifically, Table 1 shows that positive facial expressions such as happiness negatively impact sales because consumers infer that the seller is gaining an advantage at their expense, thereby reducing sellers' trustworthiness and, in turn, buyers' tendency to purchase ([51], [52]; [53]). This expectation corroborates [57]) findings, which show that a seller's broad smile results in a buyer's inference of a seller's low competence and reduces buying activity. A similar situation occurs with politicians sporting a "permasmile" (i.e., maintaining a smile for an extended period of time); they are not perceived as genuine, which induces distrust and leads to lost votes ([60]). As for negative facial expressions (i.e., sadness, anger, fear, and disgust), they invoke the action tendency to move away, which corroborates [10]) finding that frontline employees' displays of sadness undermine trust and reduce satisfaction. Last, surprise can be either positive or negative, and it results in an insignificant effect on sales. Thus, this large-scale evidence supports recent studies ([10]; [57]), and so we caution that emotional displays are bad for livestream retailing business.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Over an item's presentation span, the magnitude of sales impact  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">^</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">kt</mi></mrow></msub></math>  builds up, attains a maximum in the middle, and recedes toward the end.

We propose that to mitigate these biases, salespeople should be ranked on their individual effectiveness (objective attribution) rather than average sales (naïve attribution). Model 1 facilitates the estimation of the effectiveness of an individual salesperson by controlling for prices, duration, free shipping, time of day, and week. Table 3 reports the estimates of percentage sales increase for an individual salesperson relative to the group average based on effects coding of the dummy variables (see [22]). Consider the estimate of –.488 for salesperson 1 from Model 1 in Table 3. That estimate means salesperson 1's performance is.488% below the group average. Similarly, salesperson 6's performance is.083% above the group average. These estimated effects are not affected by human cognitive biases.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 5. Salesperson performance appraisal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We compare the salesperson's performance rank based on the naïve versus objective attributions. Panel A in Figure 5 shows the ranking of 23 salespeople based on the average sales, which ignores the effects of prices, duration, free shipping, and time of day and week. In contrast, Panel B shows the ranking of the same 23 salespeople based on their individual effectiveness. The top and the bottom three salespeople remain the same under both metrics, thereby showing that the ranking attains convergent validity by identifying the same set of best and worst performers. However, the majority of salespeople (∼75%) reside in the middle, where the rank ordering differs across metrics. Thus, the objective attribution based on salesperson's effectiveness after controlling for prices, duration, free shipping, and time of day and week should guide supervisors in more objectively selecting salespeople for rewards, recognition, and retraining.</p><a id="AN0154071463-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071463-23" title="Understanding moderation effects">Understanding moderation effects</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figures 6 and 7 depict the sales impact of emotional displays based on the full model (Model 4). In these figures, a low (high) price refers to the 25th (75th) percentile of the price distribution. First, emotional displays decrease sales. This finding holds uniformly for negative and positive emotions. Because  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Ln</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></math>  serves as the dependent variable, the marginal change in it equals  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mi></mrow></math>  , which represents "percentage change in sales." Thus, a marginal increase in emotional display corresponds to a sales decline that ranges from.004% to.18%. Across the six emotions, the magnitude of the total sales decline (.47%) is more than double the free-shipping effect (.20%). Second, because the tangent to the curves in Figures 6 and 7 becomes steeper as the intensity of emotional display increases, the sales decline <em>accelerates</em>. In other words, the sales decline increases at an increasing rate. Thus, not displaying emotions emerges as the optimal course of action. So, salespeople should sell with a neutral face, although how consumers interpret "neutral" depends on the sellers' gender, facial morphology, and contextual factors (e.g., [23]). Finally, the parallel curves in Figures 6 and 7 reveal the modest magnitude of moderation effects: sales decrease as price increases or promotion decreases (see the dashed curves).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 6.

Similarly, in the day effect, the sine and cosine variables identify the sales variations across hours of the day. Specifically, the cosine variable differentiates post meridiem (p.m.) from ante meridiem (a.m.), while the sine variable captures the rhythms across the late evening (6 p.m. to midnight) through the night hours (midnight to 6 a.m.) to the morning hours (6 a.m. to noon) and the afternoon (noon to 6 p.m.).

Likewise, shipping and product estimates are (.22,.41), (.20,.39), (.19,.36), and (.19,.36) across Models 1–4, respectively.

Specifically, marketers can, first, reach customers via new channels such as social messaging apps (Facebook, WeChat), livestreaming services (e.g., Twitch), and internet platforms (e.g., Taobao Live) that integrate shopping and entertainment. Second, these technology platforms facilitate purchases from wherever and whenever customers are seeking to buy. Third, they shorten the purchase funnel by demonstrating a product and describing why it is a must-have item; conveying that only limited quantities are available; counting down the time remaining on the item before the next item is to be introduced; and injecting such calls to action as "grab it before its gone." Finally, technology allows value capture in formats not possible previously: noncash payments (e.g., PayPal, Venmo), installment payments (e.g., Klarna unsecured loans), and barter payments (e.g., BarterOnly.com, which provides exchanges of used products). Marketers need to imagine how they can integrate such value creation and value capture opportunities made possible by technological advances.</p><a id="AN0154071463-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071463-34" title="Large-scale unobtrusive emotions data">Large-scale unobtrusive emotions data</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Earlier studies used human intervention to collect data on emotional displays at a small scale (e.g., [<a id="bib8up

These results not only make original contributions to the extant literature but also offer guidance to design technology-inspired service agents (e.g., avatars, virtual news anchors) to be more humanlike ([11]; [37]).

Second, the greater the intensity, the larger the decline. To mitigate the negative effect, salespeople should consider toning down their facial expressions. To mitigate the quadratic effects of intensity, they can abate their exaggerated expressions. Together, these findings indicate a new maxim: sell with a straight face. Consistent with this maxim, [12], p. 82) advocates that direct marketers should use a "journalist approach" to answer the "who, what, why, when, where of a product. Whom is the product for? What does it do? Why is it beneficial? When can it be used? Where can it be bought?"

This U-shaped sales resistance curve provides actionable guidelines to practitioners. Emotional displays at the beginning and end of presentations help engage consumers and build rapport. However, during the livestream show, hosts should monitor the frequency and intensity of their emotional expressions. Because genuine interactions involve less emotional and more neutral expressions, salespeople can make emotional connections with the audience with neutral expressions and lessen the insidious effects of sales resistance.

However, this quantity depends on factors such as prices, duration, free shipping, and time of day and week. In other words, a salesperson can validly object that another salesperson's larger actual sales are not reflective of his/her performance alone because price, duration, free shipping, and time of day and week also impacted sales. Cognitive biases further compound such performance appraisals. Prominent factors driving cognitive biases include the fundamental attribution error, halo effects, the leniency bias, the recency bias, selective perception, the self-serving bias, and the similarity bias (e.g., [48]). Fundamental attribution error refers to supervisors underestimating the influence of external factors and overestimating the influence of internal factors when judging a salesperson's performance; halo effects arise when a general impression of a salesperson overshadows the relevant metrics; leniency bias refers to a supervisor's tendency to rate all salespeople positively (or negatively), reducing the difference between top and bottom performers; recency bias creeps in when recent events (e.g., bumper sales, sharp declines) influence supervisors' judgments; selective perception refers to the supervisor's tendency to notice certain metrics and filter out others; self-serving bias emerges when a salesperson attributes own successes to internal factors and failures to external factors; and similarity bias (i.e., homophily) shapes the evaluation when supervisors reward a salesperson similar to themselves.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Using Table 3, managers can objectively rank salespeople (see Panel C in Figure 5) to circumvent the effects of the aforementioned biases.

One explanation may be the absence of social interaction. When the salesperson smiles, the viewers may not reciprocate because the salesperson's emotions are not targeted to a specific viewer. Such differences provide the impetus to study screen-mediated face-to-face interactions in the presence of social others. For example, [21] contend that the customer purchase journey involves traveling with <em>social others</em>, which necessitates investigations into the various influences that members of the social network can have on buyers' appraisals, intentions, and actions. In a livestream e-commerce setting, the host becomes an important social other. Viewers can readily communicate with the influencer via live chat texts, emojis, voice, and/or video and further enhance their sense of connection with that celebrity (i.e., parasocial relationship). Does the host's verbal and nonverbal communications influence viewers' behavior in such communal, two-way screen-mediated exchanges? Do purchases by social others induce "fear of missing out"? [43] suggests conversion rates of 30% in livestream shopping versus 3% in traditional marketing. To incorporate such two-way communications in the models, researchers should augment the regressors with the characteristics of not only the items and sellers (as in this study), but also the network of social others and the hosts.

This study combines machine learning technology and marketing. Specifically, we develop the retail analytics engine (see Figure 1) to unobtrusively collect data on face presence and emotional displays. Applying this technology to livestream retail data, we found that facial expressions, including happiness, adversely impact sales. This counterintuitive and provocative finding suggests that salespeople should sell with a straight face. These negative effects exhibit U-shaped dynamics over an item's presentation span, uniformly across six emotions, revealing that the largest sales resistance occurs during the middle of the presentation. Furthermore, the presence of a face matters because it impacts sales positively; therefore, it should be present more than is currently the case. Yet, its optimal allocation over time should be reduced over the initial 10% span, then gradually increased as the presentation progresses, and subsequently tapered down in the last 15% span. Finally, the retail analytics engine empowers managers to more objectively assess the effectiveness of each individual salesperson (see Figure 5), thereby circumventing cognitive biases in performance appraisals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study highlights the importance of monitoring and managing facial expressions. One implication is to train new salespeople. The firm can analyze the video footage, much like sports teams watch films of critical moments in previous games to learn what individual players did well and not so well, and sales coaches can help discern the extent to which they displayed emotions and the proportion of each emotion expressed. The feedback from such debriefing sessions could be used to modify sales pitches. Another implication is to retrain experienced sales professionals. The firm can compare each salesperson with the top performer (see Figure 5) and identify which emotions the salesperson ought to tackle. Happiness is the first one that should be addressed. While previous research advocates "service with a smile," we suggest selling with a straight face. Smiling may be off-putting because it lacks authenticity ([25]), reducing trust in the seller ([10]). Subsequently, salespeople should address displays of anger, then fear, and other negative emotions. Last, this study has implications for bot marketing. As technology advances, bots will more closely mimic human facial expressions and supersede humans in monitoring and managing facial expressions. Chat bots, like humans, provide voice assistance to customers. Similarly, three-dimensional audiovisual bots, like salespeople, can engage with customers. For example, HSBC Bank in Northern California employs Pepper, a social humanoid robot ([14]).

Related academic literature is fragmented, lacking both definitional consistency and conceptual clarity. This article makes three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First, to address ambiguity with respect to its definition, this study identifies and critically evaluates key conceptual elements of the term avatar, offers a definition derived from this analysis, and provides a typology of avatars' design elements. Second, the proposed 2 × 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar's form realism and behavioral realism, across different contingencies, provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third, the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars, a synthesis of extant research, and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights, research propositions, and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. Lastly, the authors outline a research program to test the propositions and insights as well as advance future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: avatar; artificial intelligence; behavioral realism; chatbot; form realism; human–computer interaction</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Advances in computer technology have supported the proliferation of virtual characters, broadly known as <em>avatars</em>, which we define as digital entities with anthropomorphic appearance, controlled by a human or software, that have an ability to interact. Companies are heavily investing in avatars to engage and serve their customers better, and the use of avatars is predicted to increase by 241% in the travel and hospitality industry and by 187% for consumer goods ([92]). In the banking industry, 87% of companies already use some form of an avatar or plan to implement one within two years ([93]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Even as the use of avatars continues to rise, their effectiveness varies significantly across firms. For example, Progressive Insurance's avatar, Flo, serves many customers successfully on Facebook Messenger ([13]), but IKEA withdrew its avatar, Anna, from its online website following its unsatisfactory performance ([11]). No guidelines exist for effective design or use of avatars ([10]), and academic research often lags behind business practices. In addition, it is difficult to integrate extant research on avatars to establish a strong foundation because the literature in this domain is very fragmented and lacks definitional and conceptual precision, as is typical for an emerging research area. With this article, we aim to provide an integrated theoretical framework of avatars by establishing definitional and conceptual clarity, synthetizing academic research and business practices, and offering propositions that include both managerial insights and future research opportunities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article aims to make three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First, because extant research remains ambiguous with respect to defining and creating a taxonomy of avatars, it also remains difficult for researchers to compare empirical results and draw meaningful conclusions across studies. We offer an overview, in which we summarize the various ways the term <em>avatar</em> has been defined, identify and critically evaluate key conceptual elements of these definitions, and propose a definition on this basis. Then, drawing on this definition, we present a typology of avatar design to isolate elements that academics and managers can leverage to ensure avatars' effectiveness for achieving specific goals (e.g., providing standard vs. personalized solutions). This typology represents an overall organizing framework for thinking about the uses of avatars, making relevant design/implementation decisions, and identifying research gaps.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, applying our proposed avatar typology, we synthesize findings from prior literature and business practices to produce a 2 × 2 taxonomy composed of two dimensions: avatars' form realism and behavioral realism. This taxonomy enables us to generate specific research propositions to advance our understanding of and improve effectiveness of avatars in marketing. The level of alignment between an avatar's form and behavioral realism across different contingencies provides a parsimonious explanation for when an avatar is most effective, which we highlight with examples of successful and failed avatars in business practices. In particular, avatars with high form realism but low behavioral realism, which we call <em>superficial avatars</em>, can hinder customer experiences in high-risk transactions (e.g., stock purchases) because the misalignment between an anthropomorphic appearance and low intelligence leads to negative disconfirmations of expectations (e.g., Nordnet's Amelia exhibits realistic human appearance but does not offer good stock tips). In contrast, an <em>intelligent unrealistic avatar</em> (i.e., low form realism, high behavioral realism) may produce positive disconfirmations in socially complex interactions that require exchanges of sensitive personal information (e.g., Ellie, an online avatar, helps assess people's depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms); because the avatar's unrealistic human appearance cannot be mistaken for a real human, people are more likely to provide responses that are free from a social desirability bias.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, by triangulating insights from the avatar fundamentals and our synthesis of the extant research and business practices, we develop an integrative framework of avatar performance and offer key theoretical insights, research propositions, and managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. This framework sheds new light on the underlying mechanisms of effective avatar design and implementation strategies, as well as potential contingencies to these effects. In turn, we offer managerial guidelines regarding avatar deployment, specific decision rules, and insights into <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> specific avatar strategies may be effective. This foundation for a contemporary theory of avatars may spur future research; the identified academic–practice gaps and propositions in particular point to promising research directions.</p><a id="AN0154071468-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-2" title="Avatar Fundamentals">Avatar Fundamentals</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The popularity of avatars is fueled by two macroenvironmental factors. First, advancements in computer/digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI]) enabled the development of more complex avatars, and they often appear in three-dimensional (3D) forms, imbued with seemingly distinctive personalities, appearances, and behavioral patterns, and are overall more appealing than the previous, simple versions ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref6" title="3">3</a>]; [40]). Second, increase in the use of avatars reflects the growing importance of online service experiences, such as education, gaming, banking, and shopping ([40]; [56]), which firms want to make as convenient and hassle-free for customers as possible ([58]). For example, online customers often express frustration when they cannot find relevant information on a website quickly and easily; avatars can effectively and efficiently provide a solution to this issue. Today's customers also expect faster communication from companies, but immediate responses tend to be difficult and expensive for firms to achieve through traditional channels (e.g., face-to-face, telephone) ([54]). Shopping in the online environment also reduces customers' sense of social interaction and personal consultation, a concern that avatars can help address ([45]). Finally, recent technology developments enable avatars to offer expanded benefits to firms, in that "avatars capable of having complex and interactive conversations with customers will exponentially increase the amount of data businesses can access. Avatars can potentially know if [customers] were bored or happy in real time and know the exact moment someone became disengaged" ([37]).</p><a id="AN0154071468-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-3" title="Defining Avatars">Defining Avatars</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although we can readily list the benefits of avatars, no strong consensus exists regarding their precise definition (Table 1).

The ambiguity surrounding the definition of avatars makes it difficult for researchers to compare empirical results or draw meaningful conclusions across studies ([74]). To advance scientific knowledge, we need a precise definition that clearly delineates the boundaries of the construct. In this section, we review various ways avatars have been defined, identify and critically evaluate some key definitional elements, and offer a new definition derived from this analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1.

In prior academic research, 70% of articles identify an anthropomorphic or humanlike appearance as a necessary condition of a conceptual definition of an avatar. This element is important because the degree to which an avatar is anthropomorphic provides cues of its social presence ([69]). Research shows that the more anthropomorphic an avatar is perceived to be, the more credible and competent it seems ([99]), such that "a person may be represented by a highly accurate and lifelike avatar of a fir tree. Although this avatar is realistic, other users may be less likely to attribute social potential to it—and less likely to communicate with it—because it is not anthropomorphic" ([74], p. 37). Research shows that how anthropomorphic we perceive something to be impacts our expectations of certain behaviors and our willingness to interact; people treat something with a human appearance differently than they do inanimate objects ([36]). For example, Neytiri in the film <em>Avatar</em> is not a human, but because she has an anthropomorphic appearance, other characters interact with her the same way they would with a human.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Knowledge about how to deal with other humans generally is learned early in life and is more detailed and readily accessible in people's memory than knowledge about how to interact with inanimate objects ([30]). According to the computers-as-social-actors (CASA) paradigm ([68]; [70]; [84]), people tend to treat computer technology that exhibits humanlike characteristics as a social actor and apply the same social rules to it during interactions, despite being fully aware that they are dealing with a machine ([45]). The presence of an anthropomorphic appearance triggers people's simplistic social scripts (e.g., politeness, reciprocity), which in turn induce cognitive, affective, and social responses during interactions with technology ([98]). Thus, we regard an anthropomorphic appearance as an important, required element of the conceptual definition of digital avatars, because people interact differently with something they perceive as more "human." This requirement, thus, would exclude inanimate objects and brands as well as voice-only digital assistants that lack an anthropomorphic appearance.</p><a id="AN0154071468-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-5" title="Interactivity">Interactivity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interactivity refers to "the extent to which individuals perceive that the communication allows them to feel in control as if they can communicate synchronously and reciprocally with the communicator" ([18], p. 317). In defining interactivity as another critical requirement for digital avatars, we refer specifically to the ability to engage in two-way interactions, which may be verbal (voice) or nonverbal (text, animation).

Approximately 78% of the research we reviewed include interactivity as one of the elements of the conceptual definition of avatars. For example, in defining avatars as "virtual characters that can be used as company representatives in online stores," [60], p. 2) allow them to be noninteractive and capable of only one-way conversation, such as welcoming users, introducing the company, or describing available products. Some other researchers similarly do not consider interactivity as a necessary element of digital avatars (e.g., [48]). Yet most researchers focus on interactive avatars and find that they can increase customers' satisfaction with a website or product, credibility, or patronage intentions ([17]; [45]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, designing a truly interactive avatar that can engage in synchronous communication is not an easy task: "Natural language dialogue in chatbots suggests a low threshold for users to access data and services. However, whereas conversational interfaces are truly intuitive when applied to interactions between people, conversations between humans and automated conversational agents are more challenging" ([11], p. 41). The interactivity requirement would exclude entities such as "self-avatars" in clothing stores, which do not offer bidirectional communication, as well as any instances of asynchronous content, such as a lecture delivered as a prerecorded video of the instructor, or a standard greeting from a chatbot that cannot offer personalized interactions with each user. However, when there is true bidirectional interactivity, it can satisfy customers' hedonic (e.g., having fun while shopping on a website) and utilitarian (e.g., efficiently finding a solution to a problem on a website) needs ([60]). Thus, we include it as a requirement for digital avatars.</p><a id="AN0154071468-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-6" title="Controlling entity">Controlling entity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers also have different perspectives on the controlling entity, which refers to whether the control over an avatar involves a human operator or an automated computer program ([74]). Some researchers make this distinction explicit and refer to anything controlled by technology as an agent or bot, while referring to anything controlled by humans as an avatar ([74]). However, in business practices, due to cost considerations, digital avatars appear almost exclusively enabled by AI (e.g., Sophie, the Air New Zealand customer service rep). Yet we have no theoretical reason to limit the conceptual definition of avatars to only those which are enabled by AI, because it seems that consumers want a <em>perception</em> of an avatar having some level of intelligence but often cannot tell precisely who or what controls it ([57]), as there are typically no solid clues available. According to the modality–agency–interactivity–navigability model and its applications in virtual environments, if agency cues are present in an interface, they influence users' perceptions by prompting their cognitive heuristics about the nature and content of the interaction ([91]). Users' perceptions and behaviors thus differ if they learn that they are interacting with an AI-backed avatar versus one controlled by a person, reflecting the different heuristics that are evoked by machine versus human counterparts ([36]; [42]). Thus, "identity cues suggesting that the user is chatting with a human agent or machine agent can trigger human or machine heuristics respectively and accordingly affect the criteria by which they evaluate the quality of the interaction" ([42], p. 305).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, we define <em>avatars</em> as digital entities with anthropomorphic appearance, controlled by a human or software, that are able to interact. Among the academic papers we reviewed, about half (51%) include all of these elements in their conceptual definitions of avatars; the inclusion rates for each specific definitional element vary between 70% and 90%.</p><a id="AN0154071468-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-7" title="Typology of Avatar Design">Typology of Avatar Design</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on this derived definition of avatars, we propose a typology of avatar design.

For example, Amelia is a visually dynamic avatar that is capable of facial expressions and movement and has been used, with modifications, in various industries such as banking, insurance, and health care ([46]). Visually dynamic avatars with ability for facial expressions can convey emotions, which is especially helpful for customers from different cultural backgrounds: "avatars with high intensity expression and dynamics allow both the local and global audiences to achieve approximately equal levels in subject identification and emotion perception" ([106], p. 21). Thus, visually dynamic avatars may be more effective for global corporations. Additional evidence indicates that the greater an avatar's ability to exhibit facial expressions, the less perceived human agency is required to exert social influence ([<a id="bib5up

Nonverbal avatar communication can be represented by text (speech-to-text avatars), gestures, or facial expressions; verbal avatars communicate via speech; and both nonverbal and verbal avatars can communicate using a combination of these modalities. The latter category would be the highest in behavioral realism from a communication modality perspective. Research investigating the communication modality of avatars has focused primarily on avatars that are capable of both verbal and nonverbal interactions, accounting for 68% of reviewed articles, followed by research on non-verbal avatars in 26% of articles, with verbal avatars attracting the least academic attention (6%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, managers might increase behavioral realism by enabling avatars to recognize the nonverbal behaviors of users, such as their facial expressions, prompting more appropriate responses. For example, Microsoft's XiaoIce can interpret users' photos and make relevant inferences and comments ([28]). However, even with significant advances in AI, creating an avatar capable of correctly identifying and responding to users' various emotions and contexts remains a challenge because "large, interpersonal variability exists in how people express emotions. Humans also have diverse preferences for how an agent [avatar] responds to them" ([64], p. 76).</p><a id="AN0154071468-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-14" title="Response type">Response type</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Managers can design avatars with an ability to converse in a way that feels natural to users. Previous research has mostly (60% of articles) focused on avatars that are capable of merely selecting a response from a set of preexisting, predetermined, scripted responses. For example, HSBC's virtual assistant, Amy, currently is able to select and provide users with only predetermined responses about a limited number of the bank's products. Avatars with a capability for natural responses instead can have a "relatively free-flowing conversation, using accepted vocabulary and grammar, and with the ability to track the context of the conversation and make appropriate responses" ([15], p. 9). For example, the skincare company SK-II's YUMI understands users expressing themselves in their own words and responds in an organic, conversational manner. The ability to have a conversation that feels natural is also highly correlated with perceived agency type; avatars controlled by humans would have a natural response, whereas software-controlled avatars tend to rely on scripted responses.</p><a id="AN0154071468-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-15" title="Social content">Social content</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another design element that can increase avatars' interactivity is their ability to provide some social content during interactions with users, as opposed to purely task-oriented communication (e.g., providing product information). For example, Microsoft's XiaoIce is an AI assistant that also attempts to function like a friend, checking on users after a relationship breakup or asking about the physical recovery of a user who posted a photo of a bruised leg. Since its launch in China in 2014, XiaoIce has gained great popularity, due to its emotional intelligence: "The real key takeaway is that we've focused on emotional intelligence.... We call this an empathetic computing framework, [designed to] have conversations with humans naturally, which can build a social and emotional connection. It's a good friend. As a result, they can better participate and help out in human society" ([28]). In the research we reviewed, 34% of avatars could offer some social content during their interactions.</p><a id="AN0154071468-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-16" title="Controlling entity">Controlling entity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research shows that consumers interacting with an avatar that they perceive to be controlled by a human behave differently from customers who believe the avatar is controlled by software. According to a meta-analysis, avatars controlled by humans elicit more presence and a stronger social influence than do computer-controlled avatars ([36]). Therefore, for firms that rely on software-controlled avatars (the majority of avatars in practice), reinforcing "human" elements can be very effective. They can leverage the design elements we have discussed, such as more natural speech programmed for software-controlled avatars, non-verbal behaviors and emotions, and the ability to provide social content. However, perceptions of human agency might not be desirable in all settings, as research shows that people perform worse on certain tasks when they recognize that they are interacting with a human-controlled avatar rather than software, due to social inhibition, social desirability bias, and perceptions of reduced autonomy ([56]; [105]). For example, avatars have become popular in health care, and when it comes to disclosing sensitive information such as drinking habits, users are more comfortable revealing information if they perceive less human agency ([86]).</p><a id="AN0154071468-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-17" title="Avatar Academic Research and Business Practices">Avatar Academic Research and Business Practices</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the proposed typology, all of the design elements serve to increase or decrease the form and behavioral realism of avatars.

Although the theory suggests that an anthropomorphic appearance positively affects customer outcomes, empirical results indicate some mixed effects. In various situations, lower or higher levels of form realism appeared more effective, but in other cases, no differences emerged. For example, visually static, cartoonish avatars with very low form realism increased satisfaction with a retailer, attitude toward products, and purchase intentions in some studies ([31]; [45]). However, [83] find that avatars with more realistic, humanlike appearance increased customers' perceptions of social presence, leading to higher usage intentions. [96] found no significant differences between avatars that are low or high in form realism in terms of service satisfaction. Similarly, [86] reported that a more anthropomorphic appearance of an avatar had no effect on participants' disclosure of information about sensitive topics, such as drinking behaviors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two factors may help explain these inconsistent effects. First, prior studies have not investigated all of the design elements identified in our typology that help establish avatars' form realism (e.g., visually static vs. dynamic avatars, avatars' age, gender) or how these underlying elements might induce specific effects. By focusing on only a subset of visual characteristics and, thus, failing to account for the totality of the elements that establish form realism of an avatar, these studies may have produced biased estimates.

For example, they can engage in autonomous conversations by analyzing and responding to customers' requests in real time, thereby significantly increasing customers' trust in them ([64]). Using avatar interviewers equipped with video, audio sensors, and advanced analytical software, [75] demonstrate how intelligent avatars can detect, interpret, and respond to human interviewees' emotions, cognitive effort, and potential deceptions. [97] examine the effects of an avatar that can collect and analyze a human's voice and upper-body movement and coordinate its own responses accordingly. Results show that the avatar's intelligent behavior led to positive evaluations of the avatar, regardless of whether it was controlled by a human or a software.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Even in light of these consistent findings related to avatar behavioral realism, some important research issues remain unresolved. First, few studies have investigated the underlying behavioral realism elements identified in our typology of avatar design (e.g., communication modality, social content, response type) to determine which are most critical or how they might interact with other form or behavioral realism elements. For example, [<a id="bib7up

Second, a few studies revealed some unexpected negative effects of behavioral realism (e.g., [86]), but research has yet to identify the conditions in which detrimental effects are more likely or design strategies to address them.</p><a id="AN0154071468-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-21" title="Integrated perspective on form and behavioral realism">Integrated perspective on form and behavioral realism</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our review of extant literature thus reveals a key limitation: lack of consideration of the alignment between form and behavioral realism of avatars. If the levels of form and behavioral realism are mismatched, the consequences for avatars' effectiveness may be profound and can help explain inconsistent past findings. Yet some misaligned avatars (e.g., the REA avatar is high in behavioral realism but low in form realism) seem equally as effective as well-aligned avatars (e.g., SK-II's skincare advisor YUMI is very high in both behavioral and form realism). However, other misaligned avatars have failed (e.g., Nordnet's Amelia, with high form realism but low behavioral realism). A systematic analysis of avatar effectiveness thus seems warranted and requires identifying different categories of avatars along the form and behavioral realism dimensions as a first step.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We suggest that avatars can be parsimoniously grouped into a 2 × 2 taxonomy, according to their form and behavioral realism (Figure 2). This taxonomy provides a foundation for predicting the success or failure of avatars in business practices and can inform avatar design strategies. We identify four distinct categories of avatars: simplistic, superficial, intelligent unrealistic, and digital human avatars. A simplistic avatar has an unrealistic human appearance (e.g., 2D, visually static, cartoonish image) and engages in low intelligence behaviors (e.g., scripted, only task-specific communication). For example, in the Netherlands, ING Bank uses a 2D, cartoonish-looking avatar, Inge, to provide responses to simple customer inquiries with a set of predetermined answers. In contrast, a superficial avatar has a realistic anthropomorphic appearance (e.g., 3D, visually dynamic, photorealistic image), such as Natwest Bank's Cora, but low behavioral realism, in that it is only able to offer preprogrammed answers to specific questions. An intelligent unrealistic avatar (e.g., REA) is characterized by humanlike cognitive and emotional intelligence but exhibits an unrealistic (e.g., cartoonish) human image. These avatars can engage customers in real-time, complex transactions without being mistaken for real human agents. Finally, a digital human avatar such as SK-II's YUMI is the most advanced category of avatars, characterized by both a highly realistic anthropomorphic appearance and humanlike cognitive and emotional intelligence, and is designed to provide the highest degree of realism during interactions with human users.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

Visual information (i.e., what an avatar looks like) often gets processed automatically and almost immediately, requiring minimum cognitive resources ([65]). This visual appearance then becomes the basis for <em>probabilistic consistency inferences</em>, where consumers form an expectation of some unknown attribute, based on a known attribute with which it is believed to be correlated ([27]). For example, consumers often make inferences about an unfamiliar brand's quality by using price as a signal of quality, in the belief that the two are correlated. Similarly, when an avatar looks more like a human, consumers may expect it to also behave like a human. Thus, the visual characteristics of an avatar may influence consumers' judgments of its behavioral competence, even before an interaction takes place ([73]). A more realistic anthropomorphic appearance suggests a higher level of behavioral realism, leading to a greater expectation that the avatar will behave like a real human might.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> Proposition 1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> As the form realism of an avatar increases, so do customers' expectations for its behavioral realism.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customers will use an avatar's form realism as a frame of reference for forming initial expectations about its behavioral realism. The expected level of behavioral realism will then serve as a benchmark, against which consumers will form comparative judgments of their subsequent experience. According to expectation confirmation theory ([76]), when the actual outcome is worse than expected, consumers experience a <em>negative</em> disconfirmation, leading to decreased overall satisfaction. A better-than-expected outcome instead results in a <em>positive</em> disconfirmation, which increases customers' overall satisfaction ([33]; [100]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consistent with this theory, if an avatar's behavioral realism exceeds the consumer's initial expectations, which were based on the avatar's form realism, a positive disconfirmation likely occurs, and the consumer should perceive the avatar as more credible and attractive, as well as feel increased trust or confidence in it ([<a id="bib2up

Ellie, an avatar that assesses depression and PTSD symptoms in veterans, serves as a good illustration of a positive disconfirmation: her cartoonish appearance paired with highly intelligent, humanlike behavior has proven highly effective with vulnerable individuals ([85]). Conversely, if the avatar's behavioral competency falls short of the expectations that users formed on the basis of the avatar's form realism, it may lead to a negative disconfirmation and dampen customers' satisfaction ([65]). Nordnet's Amelia exhibited minimal competence in providing customized advice for high-risk transactions (e.g., stock purchase), which proved disappointing. Amelia's realistic anthropomorphic appearance might have led customers to develop high behavioral expectations, which Amelia could not deliver, giving rise to a negative disconfirmation. Therefore, we expect asymmetric effects of misaligned avatar form and behavioral realism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> Proposition 2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Differences between the avatar's form and behavioral realism have asymmetric effects, such that customers experience </span><em>positive (negative)</em><span class="medium-normal"> disconfirmation when an avatar's behavioral realism is </span><em>greater (less)</em><span class="medium-normal"> than its form realism.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071468-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-23" title="Mediation mechanisms of avatar effects on performance">Mediation mechanisms of avatar effects on performance</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Integration of evidence across multiple research streams suggests that avatars affect performance outcomes (e.g., customers' likelihood to purchase a product) indirectly through customers' cognitive, affective, and social responses, depending on the context ([45]; [59]). Customers form cognitive responses to avatars according to the avatars' informativeness or competence in helping them make well-informed decisions ([45]; [98]). Cognitive trust, or willingness to rely on another entity's help to achieve goals in uncertain situations, is another key dimension of customers' cognitive response ([53]; [63]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interactions with avatars can also evoke affective responses in customers, such as by providing them with unique entertainment experiences ([45]). Avatars can deliver pleasurable experiences independent of their ability to facilitate a specific functional goal, such as a shopping task, by offering entertainment and emotional value during the shopping process ([98]). Human–avatar interactions are also social in nature. Avatars can enhance customers' perceived social presence (i.e., the feeling of being with another person) and create feelings of human contact or connection ([18]; [83]). Moreover, the use of an avatar can provide a sense of personalization, so customers receive information that appears tailor-made to their specific needs ([96]; [98]). The CASA framework argues that avatars can also induce feelings of reciprocity in human–computer interactions, which can strengthen perceived rapport with the avatar and enhance the users' social experience ([18]; [59]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When the levels of an avatar's form realism and behavioral realism are aligned, customers' behavioral expectations tend to be confirmed. This simple confirmation, together with high initial behavioral expectations induced by form realism, may have a strong, positive, additive effect on performance outcomes, such as customers' purchase likelihood ([76]; [90]). We expect that avatars that are aligned in their form and behavioral realism can affect customer performance outcomes through all three types of mediating responses: cognitive, affective, and social. However, when the levels of form and behavioral realism are misaligned, the outcomes might be mediated through different responses. Consider the misalignment that occurs when form realism exceeds behavioral realism. In this situation, customers may find the avatar to be especially entertaining, because its realistic anthropomorphic appearance and characteristics can also serve as hedonic elements that can increase perceived entertainment, which often is intrinsically enjoyable in its own right, regardless of performance outcomes ([24]; [103]). To the extent that perceived enjoyment creates a pleasant mood, the hedonic aspect of high form realism can improve performance outcomes such as impulsive online purchases ([78]). Yet customers also might experience negative disconfirmation, stemming from the disappointment with an avatar's cognitive and social capabilities, resulting in weakened customer performance outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternatively, when misalignment arises because the avatar's behavioral realism exceeds its form realism, the positive effects on customer outcomes might be mediated primarily by cognitive and social responses.

In the Los Angeles Superior Court, an animated cartoon avatar, Gina, which speaks multiple languages, successfully handles 1.2 million new traffic citations a year ([62]). A start-up company called TwentyBN has introduced an animated cartoon sales avatar, Millie, which can understand and answer simple questions while presenting various products ([49]) and seems to be especially effective in promoting low-ticket items, such as sunglasses. Simplistic avatars thus seem most effective in providing hassle-free, convenient options for completing quick, specific tasks (e.g., information inquiries), especially when relatively little risk is involved (e.g., inexpensive online purchases).</p><a id="AN0154071468-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-26" title="Superficial avatar">Superficial avatar</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The use of superficial avatars in various industries shows more mixed results. Among the successes, HSBC Hong Kong's Amy, a photorealistic avatar that handles routine customer inquiries similar to ING's Marie, was well-received by customers ([93]). A very realistic-looking 3D avatar, Cora of Natwest Bank in the United Kingdom, can answer 200 basic questions, such as how to open an account or complete a mortgage application ([79]). In the insurance industry, Lemonade Insurance's avatar Maya and Progressive's Flo, both very humanlike, are programmed to provide category-specific information and handle simple transactions, such as onboarding customers and giving online quotes ([13]; [82]). However, other superficial avatars have been less effective. The Swedish bank Nordnet had to discontinue its realistic-looking avatar Amelia, presumably due to her failure to provide intelligent stock purchasing advice. At IKEA, the decision to eliminate its avatar Anna stemmed from a recognition that her realistic anthropomorphic appearance led to complex customer questions, which required responses beyond the predetermined set available in the avatar's programming ([11]; [87]). Overall, superficial avatars can entertain customers while enhancing efficiency in low-risk transactions (e.g., bank account information inquiries), but they also can produce detrimental effects for customers seeking high-risk or complex transactions (e.g., financial investments) because these avatars lack the level of intelligence that their realistic anthropomorphic appearance leads users to expect.</p><a id="AN0154071468-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-27" title="Intelligent unrealistic avatar">Intelligent unrealistic avatar</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This type of avatar is relatively rare but generally successful.

With its humanlike intelligence, Ellie can engage in context-appropriate, autonomous conversations and build rapport with subtle, supportive, and sympathetic gestures when listening to a veteran's sensitive story. In turn, veterans disclose significantly more PTSD symptoms to her than to a human therapist ([43]). Thus, intelligent unrealistic avatars seem especially effective for complex relational transactions involving sensitive personal information (e.g., finances, health) as they can provide a sense of nonjudgment because customers recognize that these avatars are not human but are still competent in their tasks.</p><a id="AN0154071468-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-28" title="Digital human avatar">Digital human avatar</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">With advanced digital and computing technologies, pioneer avatar companies such as Soul Machines are breaking new ground for digital human avatars in marketing applications (<a href="http://www.soulmachines.com/">www.soulmachines.com</a>).

This uncertainty might arise from contextual factors, such as functional risk, financial risk, or price ([25]). <em>Functional risk</em> refers to the concern that the product/service may fall short of performance expectations. <em>Financial risk</em> refers to a possible loss of money, independent of purchase price, due to a poor decision (e.g., stock performance) ([25]). In addition, as the purchase <em>price</em> increases, the need for information about the quality of products or services also becomes more important to manage perceived risk ([102]). Overall, we predict that when customers feel greater uncertainty, they develop heightened expectations that an avatar that offers a realistic anthropomorphic appearance will also have a comparable level of behavioral realism, because they rely on the avatar's informativeness and ability to provide personalized advice to reduce the perceived risks associated with the purchase.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> Proposition 5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The positive effect of an avatar's form realism on customers' behavioral realism expectations is stronger when (a) functional risk is higher, (b) financial risk is higher, and (c) the product is more expensive.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We previously posited that when form realism exceeds behavioral realism, the avatar can have both positive (via customer's affective responses) and negative (via customer's cognitive and social responses) effects on performance outcomes. These mediated effects also might be moderated by perceived uncertainty. When perceived uncertainty is high, the avatar's entertainment value may become less salient to the consumer because an entertaining avatar cannot overcome the perceived risks associated with the purchase. The negative disconfirmation induced by the avatar's lack of behavioral competence should become more salient and detrimental to consumers' cognitive and social responses, resulting in weaker performance outcomes. For example, whereas the realistic, anthropomorphic appearance of HSBC's Amy seems effective because she was programmed to provide basic information to routine customer questions that do not involve high-risk transactions, the very realistic appearance of Nordnet's Amelia could not compensate for her lack of competence to offer stock advice (i.e., high financial risk transactions).

This is because an avatar's form realism may induce a positive disconfirmation regarding its behavioral competence, which can reassure customers of the usefulness of the information and personalized service provided by the avatar, thereby boosting customers' confidence in their risky purchase decisions. Another pertinent risk in today's world is that of privacy violations ([25]). If an avatar's behavioral realism exceeds its form realism, the avatar provides reassurance that customers are dealing with an intelligent, nonhuman entity that will not judge them, so it should mitigate social unease and embarrassment. The PTSD therapist Ellie works with highly private matters, involving patients disclosing emotionally and psychologically sensitive information. Such situations might evoke greater concerns if patients cannot tell whether they are dealing with a real human therapist behind the screen.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> Proposition 8: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> When an avatar's behavioral realism exceeds its form realism, its positive effects on customers' cognitive and social responses are stronger if (a) functional risk is higher, (b) financial risk is higher, (c) the product is more expensive, and (d) privacy risk is higher.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As avatars are also increasingly used in mobile apps (e.g., ING's Inge, Progressive's Flo, Bank ABC's Fatema), the choice of mobile or fixed devices as platforms on which the firm decides to provide an avatar also may be pertinent. Compared with fixed devices (e.g., desktops), mobile devices are particularly entertaining as hedonic information technologies (e.g., video games, MP3 players) have made their way into these portable devices ([103]). Moreover, consumers spend more time in online communities when they use mobile rather than fixed devices ([66]), suggesting that mobile devices are the preferred channel for online social experiences. Thus, avatars that are entertaining and capable of establishing personalized social connections with customers may be especially effective on mobile devices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> Proposition 9: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> As form realism increases, relative to behavioral realism, the use of mobile devices (compared with fixed devices) strengthens the positive effect of avatars on customers' affective responses.</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><strong> Proposition 10: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> As behavioral realism increases, relative to form realism, the use of mobile devices (compared with fixed devices) strengthens the positive effect of avatars on customers' social responses.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, the effects of customers' cognitive, affective, and social responses on performance outcomes may depend on the consumer relationship phase, which refers to the relational trajectory of a customer–seller exchange ([29]; [77]). During consumer–avatar interactions, three relationship phases are particularly important: exploration, build-up, and maturity ([47]). During the exploration phase, a consumer is primarily concerned with the potential value and benefits of dealing with the seller, so the perceived informativeness of the avatar becomes especially critical. During this initial stage, entertainment or social engagement provided by the avatar might even detract from the consumer's task objectives and compromise customer outcomes. In this stage, avatar design should allow for behavioral competence, so that the avatar can provide accurate, task-specific, customized information rather than focusing on designing highly attractive or socially engaging avatars. Such an approach should produce a positive disconfirmation for customers' cognitive experience. As the relationship proceeds to the build-up phase, the consumer has experienced some benefits from interactions with the firm's avatars, so socialization processes (e.g., building rapport) become more important. Engaging and fulfilling social experiences can help customers develop long-term commitment to the firm.

Avatars can free up employees' time, so that the employees can focus on complex customer needs and offer more value-added services, with greater productivity. Avatars can provide consistent, personalized service and help build emotional connections between the firm and its customers ([22]; [52]). For companies that serve a large portfolio of customers, avatars can also make it feasible to launch a segmented, multichannel strategy. By offering customers opportunities to engage with avatars through different channels (e.g., social media, company websites, dedicated apps), the firm ensures that it meets each customer's unique needs at the right time and in the right place.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After confirming that an avatar should be implemented, the firm should determine the design of avatar's appearance, with the clear recognition that its form realism is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, a more realistic, anthropomorphic appearance appeals to consumers, because it offers greater entertainment value ([78]). On the other hand, it elevates customers' expectations of the avatar's behavioral competence, which is much more difficult and costly to develop. If the avatar's behavioral competence falls short of customers' expectations, they experience a negative disconfirmation, which can decrease their satisfaction. To avoid negative performance outcomes, an avatar's anthropomorphic appearance should not exceed the level of its behavioral competence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Having decided on the avatar's appearance, companies can design the avatar's behavioral competence. If companies lack the resources to develop high form–high behavioral realism avatars (i.e., digital human avatars), they should allocate more resources to the avatar's behavioral intelligence than to its appearance. A positive disconfirmation of the avatar's cognitive and social competence likely produces an above-average level of customer satisfaction or even customer delight ([34]), which can increase firm performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Managers should account for form realism–behavioral realism alignment too. If an avatar has high levels of both form and behavioral realism, customers' high initial expectations about the avatar's behavioral performance will be confirmed.

Additional research is needed to determine the "zone of tolerance" and the precision required when aligning form and behavioral realism of avatars.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, in addition to considering uncertainty factors and media channel choice, design efforts should take the customer relationship phase into account, because the relative effects of customers' cognitive, affective, and social responses differ across relationship stages. For example, during the exploration phase, a positive confirmation regarding an avatar's behavioral realism can ensure good cognitive experiences (e.g., cognitive trust), but during the maturity phase, a more entertaining avatar (e.g., funny, attractive appearance) may prove more effective for sustaining the relationship. Future research that takes a lifecycle approach to avatar design and use could determine avatar effectiveness at each stage and the strategies needed to adapt in accordance with customers' dynamic needs.</p><a id="AN0154071468-32"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-32" title="Research Directions">Research Directions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our analysis of avatar design strategies indicates some promising research opportunities. First, propositions derived from our conceptual framework provide opportunities for empirical research, which can be tested using different methods. For example, researchers might collaborate with an avatar design company to manipulate form and behavioral realism in a 2 × 2 full-factorial experiment, consistent with our taxonomy in Figure 2. These results would provide evidence of the effects of form realism on expectations for behavioral realism (P<sub>1</sub>), as well as (dis)confirmations induced by any (mis)alignment (P<sub>2</sub>). Moderation tests also might be carried out with lab experiments that allow for manipulations of uncertainty factors (e.g., risk, price, privacy) or channels (e.g., mobile app vs. desktop) (P<sub>5</sub>–P<sub>10</sub>). To test the mediation effects, researchers might use a difference-in-differences field experiment to examine the aggregate main effect. Using a low form realism–low behavioral realism avatar as a baseline (control group), researchers could increase form (treatment 1 group) and behavioral (treatment 2 group) realism. Any significant differences in daily sales across the treatment groups and control group, between the pre- and posttreatment periods, would indicate the external validity of the asymmetric effects of form realism–behavioral realism misalignment (P<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>4</sub>). To confirm the distinct mediation effects, customers also could be surveyed regarding their cognitive, affective, and social responses, shortly after the treatments, followed by tests of the effects on performance outcomes (e.g., purchase intentions, word of mouth). Alternatively, a lab experiment can be used for differential mediation tests. As for the test of the relationship phase (P<sub>11</sub>), a cross-sectional survey posted on a retail website that uses an avatar might enable researchers to conduct subgroup analyses or moderated regressions to detect differential effects of mediators across relational phases. A more demanding and rigorous approach would secure panel data from a collaborating retailer that uses avatars and agrees to let the researchers track customers' relational trajectories through longitudinal surveys, while also granting them access to objective customer sales data.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Research opportunities also exist in areas that our framework does not cover. Avatars are designed to enhance the productivity of company employees, rather than replace them altogether, so continued research might investigate how to optimize avatar–human collaborations, especially if problems arise. Various approaches allow customers to switch to a human representative when necessary, using avatar-initiated, employee-initiated, or customer-initiated "exit ramps." These approaches can differ in their nature (proactive vs. reactive) and timing (early vs. late in the interaction). Thus, determining <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> human intervention is introduced could provide significant insights for achieving service recovery and ensuring customers' overall satisfaction with and commitment to the firm. In this article, we have highlighted the influence of an avatar's form realism on the overall customer experience. Additional research should uncover which specific dimensions of the avatar's anthropomorphic appearance exert the strongest impacts on customers' behavioral realism expectations, which form realism elements create the most entertaining avatar experience, or when a digital assistant without an anthropomorphic appearance (e.g., Amazon's Alexa) would perform better than an avatar. For example, if the avatar's form realism exceeds its behavioral realism, which subset of behavioral elements is most likely to lead to customers' expectation disconfirmation? What corrective actions would be effective in addressing negative disconfirmations? Research also could delve deeper into the effects of avatars' emotional intelligence, relative to their cognitive intelligence, in shaping customers' expectancy (dis)confirmations and overall experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another type of avatar that is growing in popularity is customers' self-avatars, created with virtual model technology ([89]). To inform research into these applications, the typology we developed would need to be modified to reflect the unique characteristics of self-avatars (e.g., resemblance to self). Some designer brands (e.g., Gucci) have successfully engaged customers to dress their self-avatars in branded products, then share them on social media ([16]). The limited research on self-avatars has focused primarily on enclosed online environments (e.g., retailer's website), not social media ([20]; [35]), indicating the pressing need for insights into <em>how</em>, <em>why</em>, and <em>when</em> self-avatars could perform in social media marketing campaigns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brands also have turned to virtual influencers (3D, computer-generated personalities) instead of or in addition to human influencers for online marketing campaigns. Powered by advanced AI, these avatars can attract significant followers on social media platforms. For example, with almost 3 million Instagram followers, Lil Miquela has endorsed brands such as Prada and Calvin Klein ([<a id="bib1up

This avatar actively replies to social media comments, appears in publications like <em>Vogue</em>, and even participates in live media interviews ([19]). While virtual influencers offer unique benefits to brands such as content control and versatility, they also create potential risks. For example, 61% of consumers assert that authentic, relatable content is the primary appeal of human influencers ([80]), but only 15% of followers of virtual influencers describe them as credible ([21]). Moreover, because the virtual influencer avatar is not a human, the brand it endorses ultimately is held responsible for its actions. Academic research has yet to investigate the unique benefits, risks, and operational mechanisms associated with avatar-based virtual influencer marketing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future research might also explore avatar-based targeting strategies. Demographics, psychographics, and benefits sought are widely used customer segmentation bases ([95]); they also might be used to predict which customers will be best served by a given type of avatar. For example, customer's demographic traits might interact with the avatar's demographic attributes or behavioral elements to influence customer's cognitive, affective, and social responses to the online experience. Creating a personality or decision-making style for an avatar that matches those of the customer might be an effective, psychographics-based design strategy ([<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref185" title="4">4</a>]). Segmenting markets on the basis of in-depth analyses of the motives that lead certain people to interact with avatars could also inform benefits-based avatar deployment strategies ([11]). Distinct mediation mechanisms could be uncovered across different customer segments to inform idiosyncratic avatar designs. Research is also needed to determine when avatars may distract from, rather than contribute to, the customer's experience, as well as find strategies to address these challenges. Finally, to extend beyond our focus on the relative effects of the different types of avatars established by our taxonomy, future research might compare the effects of avatars with the impacts of other digital representations such as emoji, anthropomorphized products, brand mascots, or voice-only digital assistants. Understanding when and how avatars, versus these alternative marketing tools, are more effective in influencing online shopping experience and performance outcomes demands further scientific inquiry.</p><a id="AN0154071468-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-33" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Rapid increases in the use of avatars have been fueled by two main factors: advances in digital technologies and increasing reliance on online experiences among both consumers and firms. The use of avatars is projected to grow by 35% annually ([41]). However, the effectiveness of avatars continues to be uncertain, so we offer an integrated theoretical framework to establish definitional and conceptual clarity, synthetize academic research and business practices, and offer insights and propositions that provide managerial implications and an agenda for future research. The proposed definition of avatars, as digital entities with anthropomorphic appearance, controlled by a human or software, with an ability to interact, helps us establish a design typology, which in turn gives academics and managers insights into how to isolate elements that make avatars more or less effective for specific goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We synthesize academic literature and business practices by offering a 2 × 2 form realism–behavioral realism taxonomy, which in turn enables us to derive propositions regarding the effectiveness of avatars in marketing. The level of alignment between an avatar's form realism and behavioral realism, according to several contingencies, can provide a parsimonious explanation of when an avatar will be most effective. With insights gained from our investigation of fundamental avatar elements, extant research, and business practices, we develop an integrative framework of avatar performance that offers theoretical insights, research propositions, managerial implications, and future research directions.</p><a id="AN0154071468-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071468-34" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_0022242921996646 - An Emerging Theory of Avatar Marketing</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_0022242921996646 for An Emerging Theory of Avatar Marketing by Fred Miao, Irina V.

The authors' conceptualization diverges from the conventional assumption that the ambiguity manifest in the concept of authenticity can be resolved by identifying an essential set of defining attributes or by conceptualizing it as a continuum. Using a semiotic approach, the authors identify a general system of structural relationships and ambiguous classifications that organize the meanings through which authenticity is understood and contested in a given market context. They demonstrate the contextually adaptable nature of this framework by analyzing the authenticity contradictions generated by the cultural tensions between "conscious capitalism"—a market logic that encompasses both global brands and small independent businesses, such as a farm-to-table restaurant or an organic food co-op—and the elitist critique. The Slow Food movement provides a case study for analyzing how consumers, producers, and entrepreneurs who identify with conscious capitalist ideals understand these disauthenticating, elitist associations and the strategies they use to counter them. The authors conclude by discussing implications of the analysis for theories of authenticity and for managing the authenticity challenges facing conscious capitalist brands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: authenticity; brand image; conscious capitalism; ethical consumerism; consumer identity; market logics; semiotics</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumers crave authenticity—so much so that their quest for authenticity is considered "one of the cornerstones of contemporary marketing" ([11], p. 21). This has created an enormous challenge for the field, considering that marketing itself is typically considered inherently inauthentic. —[67], p. 1)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the field of marketing, little doubt exits that "authenticity" is highly desired by consumers and thereby is a crucially important strategic resource for marketing management. Consumers are more likely to form stronger emotional attachments to a brand, business, or tourist site they perceive as being authentic ([20]; [30]; [57]; [86]) and to incorporate these market resources into their identities ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref7" title="7">7</a>]; [11]; [45]). On the managerial side, [31], p. 610) conclude that authenticity is "the most rare and coveted asset in the contemporary branding landscape." Their assertion is supported by an array of studies indicating that authenticity is integral to the enhancement of brand equity ([60]), effective brand extensions ([82]), persuasive marketing communications ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref13" title="5">5</a>]), success in relationship marketing ([22]), and emotionally engaging person and celebrity brands ([31]; [87]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although there is a clear consensus that authenticity profoundly matters to both consumers and marketers, the marketing literature also presents a recurrent concern that authenticity is a nebulous concept that has eluded precise definition ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref17" title="5">5</a>]). [67], p. 2) proclaim that this conceptual ambiguity poses a significant barrier to creating "a coherent theory of authenticity." Accordingly, they aim to redress this dilemma by presenting a general definition of authenticity based on six key perceptual components. In contrast, [81], p. 3) proposes that "authenticity is a polysemous and multilayered concept" and thus "it might <em>not</em> [emphasis added] be helpful to compress the wealth of disparate meanings associated with the concept into a single definition."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As Södergren further notes in his meta-analysis, "the majority of the research [on authenticity] has focused on characteristics that distinguish the 'real thing' from the fake" (p. 11). To further elaborate on this conceptual tendency, marketers' efforts to define authenticity almost invariably invoke some variant of genuineness, such as brands (via their management teams) staying true to ideals of timeless tradition, heritage, craftsmanship, and quality (see also [<a id="bib6up

In this spirit, [55], p. 30) propose that the authenticity of a brand's social media communications hinges on perceptions of honesty, sincerity, and being "real." [<a id="bib7up

[67] comprehensive definition of authenticity also incorporates a series of veracity-oriented constructs, such as originality (i.e., not being a copy), accuracy (i.e., being true to others), and integrity (i.e., being true to oneself).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the analytic goal of distinguishing the authentic from the inauthentic makes intuitive sense, it is a Sisyphean undertaking that attempts to specify an ambiguous cultural category by referring to other semantic terms whose meanings are also contextually contingent and malleable (i.e., honesty, sincerity, originality, genuineness, and truthfulness). Furthermore, informing marketing managers that their brand lacks authenticity because consumers see it as being unoriginal, insincere, or dishonest offers little guidance on how to resolve the deeper cultural tensions that drive these unfavorable perceptions. Rather than a checklist of definitional attributes, we argue that marketing managers need an analytic approach that can enable them to answer questions such as (<a id="bib1up

					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref29" title="5">5</a>]) as a realization that marketing, as a business practice, also occupies an ambiguous cultural position. On the one hand, marketing aims to advocate for the needs (and voices) of customers ([41]) and, yet, it is also means for companies to enhance their profits and market share. This tension readily gives rise to concerns that short-term (and potentially exploitive) profitability goals might take priority over serving customers' best interests. Accordingly, consumers are inundated with cultural narratives (ranging from journalistic reports about deceptive marketing tactics to portrayals of unscrupulous marketers by entertainment media) that encourage cynicism and distrust toward marketers' branding claims and persuasive communications ([32]; [45]; [66]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, the specific cultural meanings and associations that lead to perceptions of authenticity or inauthenticity vary across brands and markets. For example, consumers are likely to deploy different configurations of meanings, beliefs, and evaluative norms when judging the authenticity of a high-fashion retailer ([23]), a café owner who promotes their establishment as a home-away-from-home ([20]) or a global brand that positions itself as an advocate for environmental justice (e.g., Patagonia; [49]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this article, we explain and demonstrate how the semiotic square ([40]) can be used to systematically analyze such culturally heterogeneous authenticity contradictions and to develop contextually appropriate responses to the specific authenticity challenges that arise in a given market. The semiotic square is an analytic tool that has often been used to delineate cultural meanings and semantic contradictions that are manifest in both consumer perceptions and marketing strategies ([29]; [36]; [50]; [51]; [54]; [68]; [69]). From a semiotic perspective, the cultural categories of the authentic and the inauthentic are not just contrasting or oppositional terms. Rather, they are anchor points in a broader network of relationships through which the authenticity of a given brand, business, brand ambassador, social media influencer, and the like is culturally constructed and potentially contested.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our market context is conscious capitalism, which refers to a "way of thinking about capitalism and business that better reflects where we are in the human journey, the state of our world today, and the innate potential of business to make a positive impact on the world" ([62], p. 273). Conscious capitalism is particularly vulnerable to the broader authenticity–inauthenticity tension that all marketers confront to varying degrees. Therefore, it serves as a very relevant and informative context for our analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conscious capitalism's key premise is that capitalism's societal purpose has, historically, been defined too narrowly (i.e., maximizing shareholder wealth and optimizing consumers' market choices) and, accordingly, its society-enhancing potential remains greatly underutilized. Rather than grafting a social mission onto a traditional profit-maximization model, as per conventional corporate social responsibility approaches, proponents of conscious capitalism contend that businesses should place value-driven goals and social consciousness at the core of their institutional missions ([62]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By aiming to redefine the nature and function of capitalism, conscious capitalism can be analyzed as a market logic that transcends its iconic brands (e.g., Patagonia, Starbucks, TOMS, Whole Foods) or socially conscious businesses (e.g., a cooperatively owned, fair trade, local coffee shop). As discussed by [27], pp. 40–42), a market logic is an integrated network of meanings, values, and norms that provide (<a id="bib1up

Thus, consumers who support this array of brands and enterprises have access to a set of normative principles to guide their purchase choices (e.g., locally sourced materials are preferred over imported ones, plastic product packaging should be avoided); they learn an intricate system of terms and codes (e.g., "postconsumer recycled content," third-party certification labels such as the Rainforest Alliance or Certified Carbon Neutral); and they can express their socially conscious sensibilities through an array of consumption practices—wearing a Patagonia fleece, driving an electric car, shopping at a farmers' market, brandishing a reusable Whole Foods' canvas tote bag, buying fair trade chocolate, or supporting a farm-to-table restaurant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the general public discourse, however, the authenticity of conscious capitalist brands and businesses, and their consumer supporters, is frequently called into question. These authenticity challenges are sufficiently problematic that leading proponents of conscious capitalism feel compelled to address them:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There is a growing network of people building their companies based on the idea that business is about more than making a profit. It's about higher purpose ... and the innate potential of business to make a positive impact on the world.... But one of the most predictable responses we get from people when we mention the idea of conscious capitalism is, "That's an oxymoron!" ([61])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conscious capitalism's authenticity challenges hinge on a cultural tension between the profit-maximizing ethos of capitalism and the ennobling idea that capitalist enterprises can serve higher societal and moral purposes that supersede commercial interests ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref52" title="3">3</a>]; [33]). In this vein, critics often suggest that conscious capitalism deploys the language of sustainability and other socially beneficial goals for the instrumental purpose of catering to higher-income consumers who will pay a premium to imbue their consumption practices with an aura of moral virtue:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, the rise of social enterprises [i.e., conscious capitalist enterprises] has been met with hostility, particularly toward its authenticity and its sustainable impact. If their goods and services continue to be priced as they are, is the sustainable movement only for the demographic that can afford it? ([14])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[70], p. 73) similarly argue that conscious capitalism is more promotional hyperbole than a viable business reality and, further, add this reservation: "It is important to note that the firms associated with the Conscious Capitalism movement are far from a random sample of American businesses: In fact, a great many sell relatively expensive products to relatively affluent, socially- or health-conscious consumers."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This incredulous and, at times, adversarial public response to conscious capitalism has not arisen ex nihilo. Rather, it draws from a cultural narrative that we characterize as the "elitist critique." As historian [34] elaborates, the political charge of elitism has evolved from its classic populist roots, which railed against the undue power wielded by the captains of industry and affluent political insiders, to an antipathy toward the intellectual class (who may not be unduly wealthy or politically powerful). Through this shift, the charge of elitism was distanced from its origins in economic conflicts between the working class and the owners of capital (and their management intermediaries) and became repositioned in a culture war rift whereby "the 'elite' could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate, and <em>highbrow consumer preferences</em>" ([34], emphasis added).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We investigate how the specific authenticity challenges posed by the elitist critique of conscious capitalism are negotiated by consumers and producers in the context of the Slow Food movement ([89]). Slow Food encompasses an array of ideologically aligned brands, enterprises (farm-to-table restaurants, artisan producers, and organic and free-range farmers), consumption practices (e.g., shopping at a farmers' market or a local co-op), and goods and services (e.g., an heirloom tomato, grass-fed beef, a class in fermentation techniques). Slow Food's signature issues and social change goals are grounded in the market logic of conscious capitalism, including local sourcing, fair wages for workers, sustainable modes of production, environmental awareness and habitat protection, and a broader project of redressing societal ills through the coordinated actions of socially conscious businesses and consumers (see [73], [74]). The elitist critique has also become part and parcel of Slow Food's brand image, and it poses salient authenticity challenges for Slow Food's producers, entrepreneurs, and consumers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the following sections, we first discuss the key analytic premises of the semiotic square. Next, we develop a semiotic conceptualization of authenticity that maps out its structural contradictions (and ambiguous classifications). We use this analytic framework to explicate the ways in which the elitist critique gives a particular cultural form to the authenticity contradictions plaguing the market logic of conscious capitalism. We then profile the authenticating strategies that Slow Food advocates (consumers, producers, and restauranteurs) use to counter these disauthenticating elitist associations. We conclude by discussing the implications of this analysis for theories of authenticity and for managing the authenticity challenges facing conscious capitalist enterprises.</p><a id="AN0158338734-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-2" title="The Semiotics of Authenticity">The Semiotics of Authenticity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338734-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-3" title="The Semiotic Square as an Analytic Tool">The Semiotic Square as an Analytic Tool</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a semiotic perspective ([40]), the meaning and categorical boundaries of a given concept are defined through relations to what it is not. For example, the cultural meanings of masculinity have been historically established through contrasts to those that have defined femininity and the related nexus of ever-changing ideals, values, and practices through which this binary contrast has been culturally articulated and transformed over time ([50]). These structural relations give rise to ambiguous categories whose associated cultural meanings can become points of contestation and debate, such as in the cases of "metrosexuals" ([78]), stay-at-home dads ([19]), or the ongoing controversies sparked by the category of transgender athletes ([12]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The binary opposition between authenticity and inauthenticity presents a similar arrangement of contradictions and ambiguous classifications. Consequently, we propose that authenticity is not a set of discrete properties that distinguish the genuine from the fake—but, rather, an ongoing process of managing a network of contingent relationships. In some markets, for some brands and enterprises, these contingencies may be more stable, whereas in others, they may become more culturally contested and, thus, unstable. We suggest that conscious capitalist brands and businesses, owing to the elitist critique, exemplify this latter and more managerially challenging case.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 1 presents a semiotic square representation of authenticity. In this article, we use the "contradictions of authenticity" as an integrative term that encompasses the structural relations among the semiotic 3Cs (contrariety, complementarity, and contradictory relations).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. A semiotic model of the authenticity–inauthenticity opposition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The horizontal arrows represent contrariety relations. These relations are roughly analogous to the standard binary oppositions that anchor semantic differential scales. However, relations of contrariety further indicate that the meaning of a term is defined through a relationship to its binary contrast (e.g., good is understood relative to evil). Accordingly, the meaning of authenticity is always contingent on the operative meaning of inauthenticity, and vice versa. We refer to the authentic ↔ inauthentic contrariety as the primary contrariety relation because it represents the dominant tension that, in turn, sets the complementary terms for the secondary contrariety relation (i.e., not inauthentic ↔ not authentic).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The vertical arrows represent complementarity relations. Such conceptual pairings are compatible and noncontradictory (but are not necessarily synonymous or interchangeable). For example, "not inauthentic" is congruent with the dominant term, authentic. However, this classification also harbors other connotations and, thus, ambiguous meanings. For example, imagine a painting created by a famous artist, say Picasso, who at the time was a fledgling beginner, imitating the style of another painter. Because the painting does not evince Picasso's quintessential artistic motifs, its authenticity becomes ambiguous (and debatable)—that is, at what point in his career does a painting by Picasso truly become a "Picasso"? The term "not inauthentic" conveys this type of ambiguity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The diagonal arrows represent contradictory relations. These relations indicate that any entity or action deemed to be authentic (or inauthentic) will harbor some qualities that can be judged as contradicting such an assessment. As an illustration, let us again consider the idea of artistic authenticity. From a conventional standpoint, the authenticity of an artist, even a renowned one, can always be challenged on the grounds that their creations exhibit properties that are derivative of other genres, styles, or artistic predecessors (authentic ↔ not authentic). Conversely, the art world's postmodern movement disavows the idea of artistic originality and, instead, celebrates that all artistic productions are, in some sense, a reworking of something prior. As exemplified by Andy Warhol's replications of iconic cultural images (Coca-Cola bottles, Campbell Soup cans, the face of Marilyn Monroe), postmodern art is also heralded for its capacity to surprise and inspire revelatory aesthetic experiences through its creative (and often ironic) uses of repetition, collage, assemblage, montage, and bricolage (inauthentic ↔ not inauthentic) ([43]).[<a id="bib4up

For purposes of our analysis, the relevant meaning systems are the market logic of conscious capitalism and the elitist critique. This system of semiotic relationships gives rise to four emergent (and ambiguous) classifications, each harboring latent contradictions. In discussing these ambiguous categories, we first illustrate them in more general terms and then address their manifestations in the context of conscious capitalism and the elitist critique.</p><a id="AN0158338734-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-5" title="Authentic + not inauthentic">Authentic + not inauthentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This complementarity relation corresponds to what [39] discuss as indexical authenticity. In this usage, an index refers to a given object or behavior—for example, the actions of a whitewater raft guide, handprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater, a painting, or a branded good. Indexes are classified as authentic when they are believed to possess a factual and spatiotemporal connection to some validating condition. For example, consumers will judge the actions of a whitewater raft guide as authentic if they are believed to reflect an inner passion for the outdoors (rather than being a calculated performance done for remunerative purposes; [<a id="bib2up

Similarly, consumers will typically deem a branded good to be authentic when they believe its design, production, and quality certification has proceeded under the auspices of those who own or manage the brand of note.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As these examples suggest, perceptions of indexical authenticity can be more or less certain. As an example of higher certainty, Prada certifies the genuineness of its handbags by assigning each a unique and traceable serial number that is documented on an authenticity card. On the less certain side, customers have to infer the indexical authenticity of a whitewater raft guide's passion for the outdoors or a retail associate's expressions of friendliness and interpersonal concern. In these cases, consumers' judgements about the authenticity (or inauthenticity) of a marketer's actions (or the actions of other consumers) depend on their inferences about underlying motivations and intent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The elitist critique provides a constellation of culturally shared meanings and rationales that support disconfirming suppositions about the indexical authenticity of conscious capitalist enterprises and their consumer followers. These disauthenticating associations directly correspond to the ambiguous categories emerging from the primary contrariety (authentic ↔ inauthentic), the secondary contrariety (not inauthentic ↔ not authentic), and the complementarity relation of inauthentic ↔ not authentic relations.</p><a id="AN0158338734-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-6" title="Authentic + inauthentic">Authentic + inauthentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification corresponds to seemingly oxymoronic constructions such as authentic reproductions—or, in semiotic vernacular, "iconic authenticity" ([39]). In this usage, the icon is an object that is a known facsimile of an original referent and that is appreciated for its mimetic properties, as in the case of a comedian doing an uncanny impression of a celebrity. For the category of iconic authenticity, the ensuing goal is to present a compelling sense of verisimilitude through a meticulous recreation of the original referents' characteristics. Iconic authenticity is pursued by, among others, members of the cosplay community ([80]) and consumers who perform in historical recreations, such as Civil War reenactments ([17]). In a different market application, iconic authenticity would also be highly relevant to a budget-conscious consumer who wants to buy a convincing counterfeit version of an expensive designer brand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When situated in the context of the elitist critique, the "authentic + inauthentic" category assumes less favorable meanings of moral pretentiousness and hypocrisy. In this disauthenticating cultural frame, affluent (and typically left-leaning) consumers use conscious capitalist brands and goods to distinguish themselves from the price-conscious mainstream and their socioeconomic peers who display affluence through more ostentatious lifestyle choices ([24]). By claiming the mantle of moral virtue, such consumers can pursue social distinction in an otherwise orthodox manner—that is, through material displays of refined tastes ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref74" title="9">9</a>]; [44])—while appearing to disavow materialism and status consciousness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For example, during its heyday as a cultural icon, the Toyota Prius inspired oppositional brand communities (Muñiz and O'Guinn 2001) who referred to the vehicle (and its drivers) as "the pious." This epithet suggested that Prius drivers evinced a self-aggrandizing "holier than thou" stance that amplified the moral merits of their automotive preferences relative to those who made different choices ([59]). In a similar cultural vein, [13] note that ecofriendly consumers who purchase organic foods, drive electric luxury cars, and use natural cleaning products typically lead lifestyles that carry a much higher carbon footprint than lower-income consumers who live in smaller housing units, rely on public transport, and seldom fly. Seen in this critical light, such ecoconscious (affluent) consumers are virtue signaling ([24]; [42]; [90]), but their pretense of moral superiority is not warranted by these symbolic acts.</p><a id="AN0158338734-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-7" title="Not inauthentic + not authentic">Not inauthentic + not authentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification highlights that perceptions of genuineness (often taken as the sine qua non of authenticity) are a necessary but not insufficient condition for ascribing this honorific appellation to an object or action. That is, an entity or action may be deemed as genuine (i.e., not fake) but lack the perceived aesthetic or moral virtues needed to be classified as "authentic," or, conversely, to have its authenticity challenged. Thus, we can have marketplace conditions where authenticity, in its full moral and aestheticized sense, is not a relevant cultural category.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate, barring extenuating circumstances, consumers seldom venerate conventional mass-produced goods (e.g., a Big Mac, a Gillette disposable razor) for their authenticity because they lack potent associations with rarefied aesthetic ideals. Conversely, such items are not typically classified as inauthentic either (assuming that they are not knock-off products), with companies often promoting the standardized nature of their branded offerings—and the resulting performance consistency—as value-added benefits.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the context of the elitist critique, the "not inauthentic + not authentic" classification suggests that middle-class consumers who support conscious capitalist brands and enterprises are, owing to their class privileges, inherently "not authentic." This disauthenticating implication hinges not on conscious intent but on the systemic advantages afforded by their relatively privileged socioeconomic position. Rather than being hypocritical per se (i.e., authentic + inauthentic), the implication is that such consumers may genuinely believe that conscious capitalism is a viable means to create a more equitable and just society. However, their genuine belief is an ideological one, steeped in their internalized class interests. Middle-class consumers' ideological affinity for the market logic of conscious capitalism allows them to lead a materially privileged lifestyle in a guilt-free manner ([92]). By purchasing brands and goods that signify a heightened social consciousness (e.g., fair trade coffee; TOMS shoes; organic, locally sourced foods), they can feel symbolically absolved from culpability in the perpetuation of socioeconomic inequalities. Consequently, their habituated class predilections also create an ideological blind spot toward the exclusionary signals that conscious capitalist ideals and values convey to those who lack the economic and cultural resources needed to fully participate in a middle-class lifestyle ([47]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-8" title="Inauthentic + not authentic">Inauthentic + not authentic</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This ambiguous classification suggests that conscious capitalists' products, services, and brands are, to use[66] term, "gimmicks" that always promise more than they can deliver. [21], p. 668) further discuss issues relevant to this classification in their typology of transactions. Among their designations of deceitful transactions (i.e., scams), they list "fraud" and "confidence games." In the former condition, a disingenuous party misrepresents their intentions to an unsuspecting partner; in the latter condition, the scammer actively enrolls their target in the ruse, such as in catfishing and pyramid schemes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The inauthentic + not authentic classification implies a manipulative opportunism whereby an unethical agent feigns genuineness to extract ill-gotten gains from another. In the context of conscious capitalism, this disauthenticating association is most germane to the marketer side of the exchange. As one well-known example, the business ethics journalist Jon Entine accused the pioneering conscious capitalist brand The Body Shop, and its founder Anita Riddick, of fraudulent misrepresentation. According to [25], Riddick stole the brand concept from a local entrepreneur and fabricated an authenticating origin story about traveling the world searching for natural skin care and hair treatments. His exposé further contended that The Body Shop significantly overstated the percentage of profits that it donated to philanthropic causes. Though Riddick formally denied these charges, the authenticity challenges posed by these accusations, as well as others that subsequently followed, continued to plague the brand ([76]). After years of underperformance, relative to the brand's prescandal pinnacle, The Body Shop undertook a revitalizing strategy that its management characterized as an activist revamp ([77]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The "inauthentic + not authentic" classification can also cast more nuanced doubts on the authenticity of conscious capitalist entrepreneurs. Although such conscious capitalist entrepreneurs would not be committing overt acts of fraud (i.e., they are not lying about their business practices per se), the disauthenticating implication is that they are cynically espousing higher-order civic ideals to serve commercial ends, such as charging a premium to their consumers or driving higher stock valuations. This disauthenticating association can arise, for example, when the founder/chief executive of a privately owned conscious capitalist brand sells its rights to a larger corporate entity. Such a backlash arose when Gene Kahn—the founder of Cascadian Farms—sold his business to General Mills. Many leading voices in the organic food community lambasted Kahn's integrity, condemning him as a Boomer sellout and warning that the brand's corporate ownership would not stay true to the higher-order values that originally galvanized the organic food movement (see [75]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-9" title="Research Procedures">Research Procedures</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To investigate how Slow Food advocates negotiate the elitist critique of conscious capitalism and its disauthenticating connotations, we recruited informants from a Slow Food chapter located in a metropolitan area of the Midwestern United States using informational flyers, contacts made at local chapter meetings, and snowballing referrals.

This ignominious view of Slow Food finds ready expression in both academic analyses (e.g., Guthman 2007; [56]) as well as journalistic accounts, such as [38], who states that "none of the aggressive, judgmental pitches of the movement have ever been proven. The power of its association with the economic elite has."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From this skeptical standpoint, Slow Food's exalted rhetoric of sustainable diets, biodiversity, and socially conscious eating (see https://<a href="http://www.slowfood.com/about-us/our-philosophy/">www.slowfood.com/about-us/our-philosophy/</a>) is a guise for privileging upper-middle-class tastes over the dietary practices of less affluent (and lower-cultural-capital) consumer segments (see [53]; [56]). Even Slow Food's ardent proponents, such as food writer Annie Levy, concede that a tacit elitism has hindered the cultural diffusion of its core principles:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">—The revered Alice Waters once said, "when we eat food that is fast, cheap, and easy, we digest those very values." What are the judgments contained in this kind of statement? She intends, I believe, to critique the values of a food system that doesn't care about its conditions or effects on people and the environment. But the words suggest that if you eat fast, cheap, and easy you become fast, cheap, and easy—language many women might recognize as shaming. Isn't this how it really sounds to someone who enjoys such food, or is caught in situations in which it might seem the best available option? ([58])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food encourages consumers to shift their culinary tastes away from fast food and industrialized fare (including the oft-demonized category of junk food) ([16]; [83]). Such admonitions can imply a moralistic hectoring and an invidious comparison with those whose food tastes and practices are more orthodox. These elitist associations often cross into other sociocultural spheres, such as the controversy sparked by former First Lady Michelle Obama's school lunch initiative, which was institutionalized through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. By explicitly disavowing fast food and processed foods, the revised school lunch guidelines dovetailed with Slow Food's mobilizing agenda—an alliance that Slow Food USA was eager to promote (see Figure 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

For the many consumers who have warm memories of enjoyable fast-food meals with friends and family (and maybe look forward to such treats), Slow Food's moralizing pronouncements seem to emanate from an elitist taste bubble that is disconnected from everyday pleasures and real-world practicality. Similarly, Slow Food's veneration of locally sourced ingredients, heirloom vegetables and grains, artisan-crafted foods, and seasonal cuisine also seems to assert an unwarranted claim to moral virtue. Rather than sacrificing for a greater societal good, such rarefied culinary objects seem more attuned to signaling that one possesses the discretionary resources of time and money to treat food and cooking as a self-actualizing identity practice. Accordingly, Slow Food is easily, via the elitist critique, decried as an aggrandized form of cultural snobbery (e.g., [53]).</p><a id="AN0158338734-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-13" title="Authenticating Strategies in the Slow Food Market">Authenticating Strategies in the Slow Food Market</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 3 represents the correspondences between Slow Food's contextualized authenticity contradictions, the disauthenticating association that ensues from each contradiction, and the strategies through which Slow Food advocates seek to negate these authenticity challenges.

Authenticity contradictions and authenticating strategies in the Slow Food market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our Slow Food consumers place the most emphasis on the reflexive strategy, which they use to counter the authentic + inauthentic contradiction (primary relation of contrariety) and its disauthenticating association of virtue signaling and moral pretentiousness. Rather than rejecting the elitist critique outright, Slow Food advocates interpret it as a warning sign that the Slow Food market has become a gentrified facsimile of the movement's origins in the everyday cuisines of rural Italians (i.e., a disparaging version of iconic authenticity). Accordingly, our participants revere practices that seem to resurrect Slow Food's agrarian values and democratizing goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The humanistic rebel strategy redresses the not inauthentic + not authentic contradiction (secondary relation of contrariety) and its disauthenticating association of social exclusion. In the context of the elitist critique, this contradiction holds that individuals whose lives have been shaped by class privilege may be blithely unaware of their own internalized elitist predispositions. From this standpoint, Slow Food advocates may have a genuine interest in making the world a better place (i.e., they are not consciously "faking it"; rather, they are being "not inauthentic"). However, they are largely oblivious to how their viewpoint on these problems and solutions has been shaped by a life of class privilege and their habituated, middle-class (bourgeoisie) sensibilities. This disauthenticating association renders Slow Food consumers as being somewhat akin to the proverbial fish in water. Rather than not realizing they are wet, however, the analogical implication is that they cannot comprehend that other terrestrial animals lack the requisite resources to enjoy life in the water, as they do.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To negate this authenticity challenge, our participants drew from humanistic rationales, such as the idea that certain kinds of experiences and social connections have magical and transformative qualities that transcend social differences ([<a id="bib2up

Importantly, this strategy combines a humanistic ethos with the idea of rebelling against a deleterious marketing and cultural status quo and, thereby, creates a distinction to the complicit, part-of-the-problem connotations of liberal elitism (see [92]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perfective strategy corresponds to the inauthentic + not authentic contradiction (relation of complementarity). This strategy is most relevant to those positioned on the entrepreneurial/production side of this market system. It aims to negate the disauthenticating association of commercialism (i.e., conscious capitalist enterprises are profit-seeking marketing ploys). In response, our Slow Food producers and entrepreneurs draw from the bohemian ideal of the artist who refuses to compromise their artistic vision, despite market incentives to "sell out" (i.e., betraying one's artistic integrity in return for financial reward) ([10]; [87]). Accordingly, they present themselves as being intrinsically committed to perfecting their Slow Food craft and pursuing conscious capitalist values and ideals, rather than doing it for the money.</p><a id="AN0158338734-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-14" title="The Reflexive Strategy">The Reflexive Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food advocates use the reflexive strategy to negate the authenticity challenge of moral pretentiousness. The implication is that Slow Food assigns an unwarranted degree of moral virtue to those who have the economic wherewithal to buy rarefied ingredients, spend time on complex meal preparations, and dine at expensive farm-to-table restaurants while casting those who lack such resources as less virtuous consumers. In response, our participants interpret Slow Food's cultural associations with affluent foodies and elite taste practices as a regrettable, but correctible, market distortion of the movement's authentic values and practices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While acknowledging that market upscaling has imbued Slow Food with an elitist aura, our participants reiterate that expensive, epicurean cuisine need not be and, indeed should not be, regarded as the quintessential expressions of Slow Food:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I think one of the things is this perception that if you shop at farmers' markets or at the co-op, it's a lot more expensive. And there is a little bit of this Slow Food bent into cooking elaborate meals, and I think some people perceive that as being elitist because it's sort of this educated way of thinking about food. I don't think of it as being elitist because a lot of times, recipes can be super expensive to buy all the ingredients for, but they don't have to be. I don't think that enjoying your food should be something that is thought of as elitist.... Like, I buy what's not super expensive at the co-op and I cook pretty simply.... What I really like about Slow Food in particular is the aspect of enjoyment and that good food is for all—what good, fair, clean food means for the farm worker to the people who are consuming the food. (Erin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Erin does not summarily dismiss the elitist charge. Rather, she takes a more ambivalent stance by first conceding that Slow Food values and ideals are often enacted in ways that can be read as elitist, such as cooking elaborate meals using expensive ingredients. In her authenticating interpretation, she counters that Slow Food values are better expressed through fundamentally simple meals that do not require extensive preparation time or costly ingredients. Her emphasis on there being many affordable options at her food co-op (which is, of course, a relative judgment) and on "cooking simply" (another relative assessment) convey that she is staying true to Slow Food's core principles rather than trying to place superficial, foodie predilections on a higher moral plane.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Erin further counters this aspect of the elitist critique by incorporating the economic interests of farmers into her inclusive interpretation of Slow Food stakeholders. This interpretation creates a rhetorical contrast between Slow Food's foundational discourse of economic populism (emphasizing fair wages for agricultural workers) ([73]) and the elitist condemnation that higher prices are merely a means for affluent consumers to mark status distinctions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Paula's narrative exhibits a similar authenticating logic to that expressed by Erin:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food has often come under fire for being elitist. I don't actually think that's true.... The beginnings of Slow Food were about people eating good food, and those were not necessarily rich people. We are talking about people who might have had very little money.... When most people think about amazing Italian cuisine, they were eating very basic foods. So, the whole idea of eating good food to me doesn't seem elitist at all.... Slow Food in the United States, yes, we do certain things that might be seen as elitist—the restaurant dinners and stuff like that. But again, you are still educating people. You are still getting more people involved. And the more people who know about local farming, sustainable farming, eating seasonally, making sure that farm workers are protected and paid properly, that spreads out. And we do projects with a variety of different populations, and we are trying to do more of that.... Slow Food does a lot of work in all its chapters to help with urban gardens or school gardens.... In the long run, our goal is that all people have access to this kind of food.... We are working toward passing that power on to more people. So, I don't think wanting children and families in need to have high-quality food is elitist. (Paula)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this vignette, Paula first differentiates Slow Food practices from elitist pretentions by invoking its historical connections to rustic Italian foodways. She asserts that Slow Food enjoins a pleasurable, resourceful, and fundamental relationship to food that should be accessible to people from all walks of life, rather than being an exclusive province of affluent consumers. However, Paula also recognizes that her inclusive rendering of Slow Food is contradicted by the realities of socioeconomic stratification. From Paula's viewpoint, Slow Food's community outreach efforts can play a pivotal role in democratizing these forms of culinary cultural capital so that consumers from less privileged backgrounds can acquire the skills and knowledge needed to incorporate Slow Food practices and ideals into their culinary routines.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When utilizing this reflexive strategy, Slow Food advocates routinely assert that cultural capital ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref114" title="9">9</a>]), rather than a lack of economic resources per se, is the primary barrier that keeps consumers from integrating Slow Food ideals and practices into their everyday lives. Christina echoes this rationale when discussing how low-income consumers could enact Slow Food practices if they had more knowledge about utilizing the fresh produce and bulk goods that often go to waste in the local food pantry where she volunteers:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some people who are in Slow Food are foodies. However, it does not cost a lot of money to eat right. There are food pantries who throw away produce because people who come to the pantry don't know what to do with it and they don't take it.... Fresh produce going to waste.... No one wants it because they don't know what to do with it. It's really unfortunate. So, people have more access than they think. There are bulk aisles at grocery stores that you can get food for less money. It is actually a lot less expensive to buy bulk rice or bulk oats or whatever else, than to buy the bagged, boxed stuff that's like creamy preprocessed. I think the real lack of resource is education, not so much money. (Christina)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Slow Food advocates often draw an authenticating contrast between foodie-ism—which fetishizes highly aestheticized meals prepared with exotic (and typically expensive) ingredients (see [52])—and the Slow Food ethos of preserving traditional foodways and skills ([75]). This distinction is quite salient to Slow Food chapter leader Kevin. He posits that Slow Food's culinary values and ideals have become misconstrued in their translation to the consumerist, status-conscious culture of the United States. Kevin's goal is to reclaim Slow Food's original ethos from its commercial appropriation by high-end retailers and restaurants:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To buy imported cheese, organic wine, and all these kinds of things, I don't think those are meant to be the most obvious expressions of Slow Food values. And I think this is where the cultural translation from Italy to the United States went wrong, is that it got tied up with those folks [i.e., affluent foodies]. In Italy, it's much more about cooking at home. It's much more about preserving grandma's recipes. It's much more about celebrating the seasons and the tradition and preserving home ways of life than it is about eating in restaurants that do everything right. And you know, like anything else, capitalism wants to subsume this revolution.... That's a schism that I am personally trying to address and maybe lead by example. I don't think we should be cooking like a Michelin-starred restaurant at home. I think we should be cooking like our grandparents and great-grandparents. And I think we can learn a lot from traditional cultures and indigenous people—to the extent that there still are any indigenous people—how to eat well, and you know, a lot of those foods have become an affectation in restaurants. They'll have poutine, but it's made with truffles, and confit duck and elaborate things. I have realized that we are all attracted to the comfort foods and the simple foods, like tacos, and they are easy and fun to make. (Kevin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Kevin, Slow Food should be accessible, basic, fun, and easy—characteristics that diverge from associations with rarity, cosmopolitan sophistication, aesthetic refinement, and technical proficiency that mark elite tastes ([44]). If read in a more critical light, Kevin's narrative reiterates the nostalgic glossing of preindustrial foodways that critics of the Slow Food movement assail for ignoring the harsh realities of scarcity and subsistence endured by those who had to survive on "traditional diets" ([56]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While romanticizing images of a bucolic culinary past have considerable appeal to our Slow Food advocates, the idea of rekindling a premodern utopia is not that central to the reflexive strategy's authenticating function. Rather, these homages to a bygone era, when people lived close to the land and prepared food in traditional ways, symbolically link Slow Food practices to agrarian and/or rural lifestyles far removed from elite pretensions:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I did an internship through Worldwide Working on Organic Farms.... I went to Italy and I milked sheep and goats for a couple of months. And it was very rural. It was very low-tech. We milked in buckets by hand, sheep and goats, and we kind of went out with big sticks and sheepdogs and herded them.... Slow Food originated in Bra, Italy, and that was only like an hour and a half away from the farm. So, I think that's kind of how Marco [the farmer] was involved in Slow Food. He made cheese that was very well regarded, and he went to cheese festivals and stuff. But I mean the whole day was slow. Like wake up kind of late, drink your espresso, milk leisurely, walk the mount, you know. Dinner took a really long time, but that was kind of okay. And just kind of do the same things over and over again. So, we all cooked together. They also did some kind of agro-tourism. They'd have people from the city come out and we would cook with them the food we either grew or found.... That was fun. (Leslie)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Leslie's narrative validates a nexus of Slow Food ideals regarding small-scale production and the slower pace of agrarian life. While this rural setting has some trappings of a staged performance—most notably Marco's side business in agro-tourism—it places Slow Food in a symbolic sphere far removed from the Whole Foods brandscape, expensive farm-to-table restaurants, and other consumption domains invocative of foodie affectations (see [52]). For Leslie, her story of interning on a rustic Italian farm affirms that she has actually lived the conscious capitalist values she endorses through her Slow Food advocacy (and thus is not a hypocritical moralizer). More generally, consumer narratives that link Slow Food practices to traditional modes of food production, down-home family meals, and simpler ways of living—rather than exorbitantly priced gourmet dishes—express a rhetorical parry to the elitist charge of moral pretentiousness.</p><a id="AN0158338734-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-15" title="The Humanistic Rebel Strategy">The Humanistic Rebel Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our Slow Food advocates use the humanistic rebel strategy to redress the authenticity challenge posed by the elitist critique's connotation of social exclusion and the related sociological argument that consumers' social class backgrounds structurally predetermine their taste affinities ([44]). From this critical viewpoint, Slow Food advocates may not consciously intend to be elitists, but their preferences for goods that convey meanings of sustainability, locavorism, and artisanship betray a host of class advantages that distinguish them from consumers whose lives are marked by conditions of necessity ([47]). While Slow Food advocates may be well intentioned (i.e., they are being "not inauthentic"), they are also complicit in a system of institutionalized class-based inequities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate this tension, let us reassess Leslie's preceding vignette in relation to this association with social exclusion (rather than moral pretentiousness). On the one hand, working for room and board on a small, rural farm clearly diverges from conventional notions of status posturing. However, a sociological counterpoint is that Leslie—as a college-educated young adult engaging in an exploratory experience—is building a reservoir of life stories and cultural capital that can afford career and status advantages later in life (see [91]). Seen in this sociological light, Leslie is enacting her class privilege by having the economic and social latitude to intern on a rustic, Italian farm before transitioning into more conventional middle-class occupational pursuits, such as attending graduate school.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a chapter leader, Kevin has oriented his local chapter's activities toward the goal of making Slow Food a more inclusive organization that does not merely cater to the interests of middle-class consumers. When implementing these outreach projects, however, Kevin recognizes that many Slow Food practices are simply incompatible with the situational demands that lower-income consumers have to negotiate on a daily basis:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I have amazing privilege,... like being an American to a middle-aged white guy who has very marketable skills.... But I realize that that is a privilege, and this is the biggest thing for us in Slow Food to grapple with—that a single mother who has three jobs and two kids doesn't have the luxury of deciding, "I think I would like to work less and spend more time in my garden".... So, you have to be very careful and sensitive about it. (Kevin)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Kevin believes that this class chasm can be bridged if his team of middle-class volunteers presents Slow Food's approach to food provisioning, cooking, and eating in a manner that is "sensitive" (i.e., adapted) to the lifestyle constraints faced by less well-resourced consumers. His optimistic viewpoint is based on the authenticating assumption that Slow Food's experiential and social benefits have an inherent appeal to consumers, regardless of their class position, because they tap into fundamental human desires and needs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The humanistic rebel strategy takes this inclusive rationale further by suggesting that a confluence of technological and commercial forces have locked individuals into an accelerating pace of life. Consequently, experiences of social connection, spontaneity, and everyday small pleasures are sacrificed to demands for efficiency, convenience, and the seductive (and ultimately alienating) effects of social media and digital communications.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Aaron echoes this humanistic rebel mantra in his commentary on the inherent importance of eating and cooking with others:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">You have the social component of Slow Food as cooking and eating together and taking time to reflect and to connect and to develop community. That's something that we lose when we have things like drive-through or microwave dinners, which aren't to be destroyed or demonized altogether. I take advantage of these services of society. But for them to be the baseline means that we are losing what ... enriches our social systems a lot more than people eating alone and interacting through screens.... So, I think food, when it's jointly cooked and eaten, serves as a very natural medium for connection and idea generation and creativity. (Aaron)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Aaron characterizes Slow Food as a needed corrective to societal transformations in the practices of cooking and eating that have resulted in a loss of sociability, communal bonding, and creative interactions. By interpreting Slow Food as a medium for enjoining meaningful social interactions, Aaron expands its cultural province well beyond the predilections of affluent consumers. Aaron's caveat that he has partaken in the conveniences afforded by fast food and microwave meals is another rhetorical means for distancing his Slow Food preferences from elitist connotations. His narrative signals a conscious disavowal of snobbery by acknowledging that there is a legitimate time and place for "fast food." Aaron then specifies the problem as the cultural ubiquity of fast food, which, in turn, he links to dehumanizing consequences.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When expressing the humanistic rebel strategy, our participants often couched the communal experiences of preparing or eating food as magical moments that affirm Slow Food's class-transcendent qualities:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I ran a cheese-making class, and that was really fun because I've always been interested in cheese-making, just for the fun of it. There were seven or eight people there. And one of the members still is making cheese today. And it was really fun to be able to share that magic with people. That this is how this cheese actually comes into being, and it's totally doable by yourself at home. So, that's really exciting, that he got so inspired. It's fun to see somebody get really interested in something. (Amanda)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Amanda emphasizes the magic of cheese-making and the inspiration and rewarding personal experiences of self-sufficiency it can enjoin (i.e., "totally doable by yourself at home"). Her narrative expresses a cosmological view of nature as a magical, life-transforming force ([<a id="bib2up

In keeping with this formulation, Amanda interprets the sharing of her Slow Food skills as a means to help others experience these inspiring connections to nature, which, in turn, implies a revelatory contrast to the alienated experiences of industrialized fast food.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie similarly interprets her self-taught Slow Food skills as a means to help people create a sense of communal togetherness and to experience new sensory pleasures and magical connections to the land:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">I think of Slow Food as taking your time to respect the ingredients and preparing them from scratch and enjoying food. And that, to me, resonates. And bringing back the social aspect of eating. Like, you take time to prepare this meal, you sit down, you share it with people who care about the same things that you do. And it's also, creating another community of people who value these things whether they're growing, or cooking, or eating; having that kind of common thread, I think is really satisfying. (Maggie)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie venerates Slow Food as being inherently conducive to experiences of sociability and community and as a way to recognize the meaningfulness of food (a normative orientation that reads as a general human value, rather than a class-interested practice). However, Maggie is a meat producer who, like other Slow Food entrepreneurs, faces an additional task of negating contradictions that derive from the "inauthentic + not authentic" category.</p><a id="AN0158338734-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-16" title="The Perfective Strategy">The Perfective Strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The perfective strategy seeks to negate Slow Food's disauthenticating association with commercialism. This aspect of the elitist critique casts Slow Food producers and entrepreneurs as disingenuous actors who are enrolling consumers into an inauthentic market relationship (akin to a gimmick or a confidence game) to serve their own economic interests. In response, our Slow Food entrepreneurs strive to authenticate their actions by signaling that they would never compromise their Slow Food ideals for the sake of profit, such as by recounting the copious amounts of time and energy they invest into perfecting their Slow Food enterprises</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In this spirit, Tom, a farm-to-table restauranteur, views his business as a way to enact his passionate commitment to producing food in a more meaningful and socially beneficial way:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When you go to a fast-food restaurant, you have no idea of who actually made that food and the process of where it came from is not known to you. The taste and flavor are mostly engineered to play off the cheap sensory sensations. So, it's fatty and salty and sweet and so, yeah, on a certain level, it might be gratifying, but it's a cheap way to do it that is less meaningful. Slow Food is like, "We're going to do things in a way that is process oriented!" I talk about process a lot.... We [Tom and his restaurant staff] were really structured around learning, and so it was a process where we feel like we've excelled and learned a lot and we'll keep pursuing that.... [With Slow Food,] you have this process where people are eating and making something and understanding where it came from and how it works. Eating is such an important part of our lives, and it can have a really important impact on our community and environment. So, the more you understand about it, hopefully you'll make better decisions. The basic motto of Slow Food is clean, fair, and good food. I can totally get behind those values. (Tom)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During his interview, Tom extensively discussed "the process" aspects of his restaurant and how he views it less as a business than a means to cultivate and diffuse knowledge about the complex interrelationships among food, cooking, sensory enjoyment, ecology, and societal well-being. His quote also reiterates Slow Food's argument that the experiences of these simple culinary pleasures can mobilize consumers to resist the industrialization of the food system (thus echoing the humanistic rebel strategy). For Slow Food entrepreneurs, however, it serves the additional function of associating their enterprises with civic goals that stand distinct from conventional commercial aims.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Returning to Maggie, she raises pasture-fed rabbits for sale to farm-to-table restaurants and consumers. In developing her production techniques, Maggie has constantly experimented with different procedures and equipment designs. Through this long trial-and-error process, Maggie believes she has developed an innovative method that better simulates the lives her rabbits would enjoy outside of captivity:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie: Daniel Salatin is the son of Joel Salatin, who is the owner of Polyface Farms, and he is the person who is raising rabbits in this system that he has devised and calls the Hare Pen system. So essentially, you still have your does in cages.... You put them in a glorified cage that you then put on grass.... I've copied their system exactly, and I was very unsatisfied with the results that I got. [Maggie then provides an extensive description of her alternative and labor-intensive system and how she developed it]... I don't know why I kept doing it. But I finally have a system that is really effective.... It just was a lot of observation of the rabbits on pasture, making so many mistakes and then incorporating what I had learned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interviewer: Did you have any economic incentives?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Maggie: No! It has to be a personal belief that there might be a better way to do things.... It's kind of like what makes an artist a good artist. If they all hold the brush the same way and they are using the same colors, but they create vastly different things, and one appeals to you, and one doesn't appeal to you. So, what makes that one piece of art recognized by the vast majority of people as superior?... I have this wonderful platform to invest energy and creativity, and it's nice. And so, I feel in some ways really lucky.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Invoking the image of the passionate artist, Maggie distinguishes her efforts to perfect an ecologically appropriate system for raising rabbits from crass commercial and economic interests. Maggie's closing sentiment expresses her authenticating belief that such actions can make things better, rather than being driven by instrumental aims. Through storytelling, and by showing how her system works to customers who visit her farm, Maggie deploys narrative and material resources to negate disauthenticating concerns that her Slow Food affinities are merely an instrumental means to charge higher prices. Her personal investment in learning about rabbits' natural habitats/behaviors and inventing a complex ecosystem for raising them further signals that she is not likely to compromise her Slow Food principles in the interest of commercial expediency.</p><a id="AN0158338734-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-17" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338734-18"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-18" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has treated authenticity as a perceptual value or quality that consumers attribute to a brand ([11]; [55]), person-brand ([87]), product ([57]), or performance ([<a id="bib5up

In contrast, we have reconceptualized authenticity as an ongoing process through which consumers and marketers negotiate a contextualized system of cultural contradictions and ambiguous classifications. We suggest that our semiotic framework can better analyze the authenticity contestations that arise in a given market or sociocultural context than conventional theories that assume authenticity perceptions operate on a continuum or selectively draw from an essential set of defining attributes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The conceptualization of authenticity as a relative point along an authentic-to-inauthentic continuum ([22]; [65]) can depict a zone of ambiguity where the authenticity or inauthenticity of a market actor is perceived as being uncertain and, thus, debatable. However, this conceptualization does not offer a means to specifically analyze the cultural meanings (and the interrelationships among them) that generate these ambiguous perceptions. Accordingly, it offers limited theoretical discrimination and managerial guidance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For example, [65] argue that quality commitment, heritage, and sincerity are the primary perceptual cues of authenticity. They then propose that brands should differentially leverage these cues depending on whether consumers perceive them as having low, moderate, or high levels of authenticity. In their normative framework, brands with low perceived authenticity should emphasize sincerity, brands with moderate perceived authenticity should emphasize quality and heritage, and brands with a high level of perceived authenticity should emphasize all three authenticity cues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Such recommendations presume that brands falling into the lower and middle sectors of this proposed continuum have a shortfall of perceived quality commitment, sincerity, or heritage that is rectifiable through compensatory signaling. However, such contested brands are often plagued by contradictory meanings that undermine their promoted claims to authenticity ([37]; [86]). Furthermore, more complex, disauthenticating narratives, such as the elitist critique, can cast doubt on the very credibility of such authenticating cues when used by a contested brand or actors in a market system.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Turning to combinatory definitions, [67] have offered a comprehensive theorization of authenticity (as understood from the consumer's perspective) that warrants comparison to our approach. They identify six subdimensions of authenticity (accuracy, connectedness, integrity, legitimacy, originality, and proficiency) and then trace out the relative impact of those dimensions across different market categories and on consumers' behavioral intentions. Rather than a continuum, Nunes, Ordanini, and Giambastiani argue for a family resemblance explanation in which "a concept (authenticity, in this case) may be qualified by different subsets of its dimensions across different contexts, and not always by all of them in the same way" (p. 16).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Like a continuum, [67] family resemblance logic is limited to the explanation that authenticity is a multidimensional construct whose subcomponents may be more or less important in a given market or consumption context. In contrast, a semiotic framework shifts attention from correlational premises (e.g., this authenticity subdimension seems more important for hedonic products than utilitarian ones) to the cultural meanings, and underlying structural contradictions, relevant to a particular judgment regarding the authenticity of a given product, brand, or market action. For example, the authentic ↔ inauthentic tension elevates the importance of authenticity's moral dimensions in ways that traverse product category distinctions, such as hedonic or utilitarian.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To illustrate, a hamburger would typically be classified as a hedonic good. [67], pp. 3–4) find that judgments of "legitimacy"—which they define as "the extent to which a product or service adheres to shared norms, standards, rules, or traditions present in the market ... appear to matter for utilitarian but not hedonic products." However, if we examine this consumer choice in the context of the Slow Food market, then legitimacy becomes a far more important issue. From this standpoint, an "authentic burger" would need to exhibit fidelity to various aesthetic and moral norms—grass-fed beef, local sourcing, traditional preparation techniques, and so on—and, its perceived authenticity would be understood and legitimated through a contrast to fast-food burgers. That authenticating contrast (the fast-food burger vs. a Slow Food burger) could then become subject to the elitist critique, which, in turn, would provide motivation for Slow Food advocates to negate these disauthenticating associations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, we have argued that authenticity is culturally constructed (and contested) in a network of structural relations (rather than being a discrete set of essential properties attributed to a brand, person-brand, market performance, or market relationship). Consumers and marketers alike covet indexical authenticity (i.e., the abstract ideal of authenticity) because it can confer cultural legitimacy ([51]), moral authority ([59]), and identity validation ([<a id="bib7up

However, this authenticity ideal is structurally linked to contradictory meanings and ambiguous classifications. When consumers' or marketers' authenticity claims are challenged by these cultural contradictions, they have pressing incentives to distinguish their actions and identities from the invoked disauthenticating associations. In the following subsection, we discuss how this authenticating goal can be enacted by negating associations that flow along the contradictory path of deception and promoting those that follow the contradictory path of redemption.</p><a id="AN0158338734-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-19" title="Two Managerial Paths to Authenticating a Brand">Two Managerial Paths to Authenticating a Brand</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As [49] have argued, marketing managers often find it difficult to redress brand image problems because they are unable to effectively decipher the cultural meanings contributing to those dilemmas. Our semiotic framework can help redress this managerial shortfall. It offers a tangible means for marketing managers to systematically analyze the cultural contradictions of authenticity that emerge in a given market and then to identify strategies for authenticating their brands in the face of these challenges.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a general heuristic, we propose that marketers can be successful in authenticating their brands and/or other strategic assets when they are able to accomplish two complementary goals. The first is to leverage cultural meanings that negate the disauthenticating associations that flow along the contradictory of deception path (authentic → not authentic; see Figure 1). When consumers follow this perceptual path, they experience a glaring contradiction between a prevailing ideal of authenticity and its market manifestation in a brand or marketing practice (authentic ↔ not authentic), which then leads to an association of inauthenticity via the complementary relation of not authentic → inauthentic. In response, marketers should try to provide consumers with compelling and emotionally resonant meanings and rationales that discount the credibility, relevance, or importance of the disauthenticating associations that have gained cultural currency in their respective market.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As one illustration, Patagonia confronted a path of deception authenticity challenge soon after it began campaigning against the Trump administration's executive order to reduce the size of Utah's Bears Ears National Monument by two million acres. On December 4, 2017, Patagonia featured this message on the front page of its website: "The President Stole Your Land: In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history." This web page then directed consumers to various information sources and encouraged consumers to contact their elected officials and to also take the protest to social media, using the hashtag #MonumentalMistakes (see [<a id="bib1up

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke condemned Patagonia as a dishonest "special interest" and proclaimed it was "shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to put money in their coffers." Utah Representative Bob Bishop, then chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, also evoked the elitist critique in his tweet proclaiming that "Patagonia is Lying to You... A corporate giant hijacking our public lands debate to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco" (quoted in [35]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of our model, the Trump administration's response challenged the authenticity of Patagonia's mobilizing campaign by impugning its motivations, thereby reframing an ostensibly authentic (conscious capitalist) action as a disingenuous public relations stunt designed to extract more profits from elite consumers (authentic → inauthentic), which, in turn, triggers the complementary association to inauthenticity. In response, Patagonia joined as a coplaintiff with five Native American tribes and several nonprofit groups in a lawsuit aiming to halt the policy change ([35]; see also https://<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/stories/hey-hows-that-lawsuit-against-the-president-going/story-72248.html">www.patagonia.com/stories/hey-hows-that-lawsuit-against-the-president-going/story-72248.html</a>). Patagonia also continued to be a vocal critic of the Trump administration's environmental policies and, in a politically and ideologically related vein, donated all its tax savings from the Trump-backed corporate tax cut to environmental groups while condemning the new corporate tax rates as being irresponsible ([63]). Through these responses, Patagonia signaled a deeper commitment to its conscious capitalist values and gave consumers reasons to doubt or dismiss the disauthenticating associations of greed and deception that were being cast on it. In response to Patagonia's uncompromising stance, <em>Inc</em>. offered the following commentary on its 2018 Company of the Year finalist:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Patagonia and its fans, that purpose is doing whatever they can to try to save the planet.

And—so far, anyway—it's only further burnished the Patagonia brand. ([<a id="bib8up

This redemptive chain of associations begins with the widespread cultural view of marketers as inauthentic and, thus, untrustworthy actors ([45]; [66]; [67]). Accordingly, we can assume that consumers will typically harbor varying degrees of skepticism and suspicion toward the authenticity of marketing and branding claims. Redemptive meanings encourage consumers to believe that a given brand or business is operating in ways that favorably diverge from the marketing status quo (i.e., not inauthentic) which, in turn, leads to the complementary relation of not inauthentic → authentic.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Volkswagen's (VW's) "Hello Light" advertisement, which launched its new line of electric vehicles (circa 2019), takes viewers on a journey that follows a path of redemption arc (see https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEvNL6oEr0U">www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEvNL6oEr0U</a>). The ad begins with a silhouetted figure entering a dark and seemingly abandoned production facility, while a news report about VW's emission scandal, or "Dieselgate," blares in the background. In a seemingly counterproductive marketing communications move, the ad explicitly reminds its viewers of all the inauthentic associations (VW as liar, deceiver) that arose from those "dark" days. The protagonist is revealed to be a despondent engineer struggling to design a new VW model, against the musical backdrop of Simon and Garfunkel's 1960s anthem, "The Sound of Silence." Desperate for inspiration, our engineer scours the company archives and finds his creative muse—an image of the iconic VW Van (aka the "Love Bus").</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Through the choice of song and reference to this totem of the 1960s counterculture, the ad recalls VW's countercultural legacy as an authentic symbol of antimaterialist values and a rebuke to status consciousness and marketing hype ([46]). The ad's message is that VW, despite having lost its way, still possesses a latent essential "goodness" that is "not inauthentic." As "The Sound of Silence" reaches its crescendo, lights go on, puncturing the darkness. We observe the production facility come to life and give metaphorical rebirth to the VW brand in the form of an electric van (which also places "The Sound of Silence" on a different, ecofriendly cultural register). Thus, the ad's narrative follows the redemptive path of "inauthentic" (VW's Dieselgate) to "not inauthentic" (VW's 1960's countercultural heyday) to "authentic" (signifying that VW has rekindled its socially conscious roots).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our discussion of the three authenticating strategies used by Slow Food consumers and entrepreneurs has emphasized their function as a defensive means to disavow or negate the disauthenticating associations that flow along the contradictory of deception path. However, these same strategies also promote affirmative meanings and associations that operate along the contradictory of redemption path. For example, the perfective strategy does more than negate the disauthenticating association with commercialism. It also magnifies authenticating differences to fast food or industrialized food production and thereby encourages consumers to interpret Slow Food enterprises in a manner compatible with the contradictory of redemption path (even though they may be aware of some disauthenticating associations). This redemptive associative chain takes the following form: Slow Food entrepreneurs are suspected to be "inauthentic" due to their commercial motivations → Slow Food entrepreneurs are seen as being "not inauthentic" because their deep commitment to artisan ideals and noncommercial values differentiates them from conventional fast-food establishments and industrialized modes of commercial food production → the signification of "not inauthentic" supports a broader conclusion that the Slow Food entrepreneur is an authentic actor.</p><a id="AN0158338734-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-20" title="Implications for Managers of Conscious Capitalist Brands">Implications for Managers of Conscious Capitalist Brands</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given their shared ideological affinities, the authenticating strategies used by Slow Food advocates should also have a high degree of applicability to brands espousing conscious capitalist goals and ideals. Of the three authenticating strategies, we find numerous examples of conscious capitalist brands that have enacted some version of the perfective strategy, which aims to negate associations with commercial opportunism and foster interpretations compatible with the contradictory of redemption path. While less commonplace, we can also find branding campaigns that align with the reflexive and humanistic rebel strategies. In the following discussion, we use these various exemplars to illustrate how these authenticating strategies can be implemented by conscious capitalist brands and the authenticity contradictions they potentially redress.</p><a id="AN0158338734-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-21" title="Perfective strategy">Perfective strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brands using the perfective strategy engage in unconventional actions that demonstrate a deep commitment to activist causes that supersede profit motives. Over the years, Patagonia has made frequent use of this authenticating strategy to signal that proenvironmental values were central to its corporate mission, even when such acts could mean sacrificing sales, such as its iconic "Don't Buy" promotion ([49]) or their "Give a Damn" holiday messaging ([72]). REI has also enacted a perfective strategy in its #OptOutside campaign, whereby the retailer closes its stores on Black Friday and encourages consumers to engage in a range of proenvironmental, outdoor activities. Like Patagonia, REI's campaign builds on (and authenticates) the brand's history of supporting environmental causes and promoting a heightened concern for habitat protection and environmental conservation. Last but not least, Clif Bar illustrated a fairly novel implementation of the perfective strategy when its founder and chief executive officer, Gary Erickson, published an "advertorial" in the <em>New York Times</em>, offering to donate ten tons of organic ingredients to his main competitor Kind Bars. This advertorial further promised to share his company's knowledge about organic sourcing and production so that the two companies could collectively "lay the foundation for a healthier, more just and sustainable food system" ([26]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Owing to their status as commercial enterprises, whose existence depends on profitability, the perfective strategies of conscious capitalist brands can always be reframed as yet another kind of commercial deception. However, such brands can lessen the cultural viability of such recursive challenges by further signaling that their passionate commitment to the supported causes takes precedence over profit motives. Though addressing a different context, [20] offer evidence that supports this strategic approach. They find that customers attribute the quality of authenticity to third-place establishments (e.g., cafes, coffee shops, restaurants) when they believe the respective proprietors are aiming to create meaningful social connections rather than merely trying to make a profit. As they write, "The authenticity perceived in treasured commercial places is based on exchanges that go beyond mere commercial aspects.... Although being business operators, proprietors invite the consumer to engage in activities that are not undertaken purely for profit" ([20], p. 913).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Accordingly, we propose that conscious capitalist brands are more likely to be perceived as authentic when they provide tangible means for consumers to participate in their social change mission but do so in ways that are not dependent on purchases. From this standpoint, The Body Shop's repositioning of its stores as activist hubs ([77])—where consumers can listen to speakers discuss environmental and social justice issues, sign petitions, and join activist organizations—is an enactment of the perfective strategy and a culturally viable means to reestablish the authenticity of its conscious capitalist branding claims.</p><a id="AN0158338734-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-22" title="Reflexive strategy">Reflexive strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This strategy aims to negate the charge that a market actor is evincing a "holier than thou" stance for actions that are either hypocritical (e.g., "do as I say, not as I do") or overstate the positive impact of the self-proclaimed act of conscious capitalist rectitude. For conscious capitalist brands, this authenticating logic most readily translates into a reformist agenda. As one prominent example, Chipotle's "Back to the Start" campaign (circa 2012) rallied a diverse assemblage of activist groups that shared a commitment to transforming the corporate-controlled system of food production and who saw the fast-food sector as exemplifying its presumed ills (see [48]). The two-minute short film, which ran across multiple media platforms, shows an increasingly disenchanted farmer witnessing the steady industrialization of his enterprise, replete with enclosed animals, the heavy use of antibiotics, and food being transformed into nondescript goo-like substances. Against the backdrop of Willie Nelson's plaintive version of Coldplay's "The Scientist," the farmer triumphantly decides to go "back to the start" by raising free-range animals, using traditional farming techniques, and selling his preindustrial goods to Chipotle.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some relevant insights into this campaign and its authenticating effects can be gleaned from a <em>Fast Company</em> interview with Jesse Coulter, co–chief creative officer of Creative Artists Agency Marketing, which worked with Chipotle's management team in developing this campaign:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We were tasked to find new ways to tell Chipotle's Food with Integrity story.... The first issue Chipotle wanted to address was industrial farming.... Chipotle shared many stories of family farmers who have turned their farms into factory farms and have subsequently grown to regret it.... It was provocative because it took a stab at Big Agriculture. Chipotle is a bold company, who has the courage to really stand up for what they believe in.... At the end of the film, a title card appears letting people know that they can download the song on iTunes, and the proceeds benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation, which is dedicated to creating a sustainable, healthy, and equitable food future. People responded and the song reached number one on the iTunes Country chart. ([15])</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When interpreted through the lens of the reflexive strategy, Chipotle's "bold" move was to accept and amplify activist groups' criticisms of the fast-food industry's sourcing and production practices, rather than attempting to deny, rationalize, or obscure these problems through conventional images of consumers enjoying their fast-food meals. The campaign thereby draws an ideological distinction between Chipotle (as a reformist enterprise returning to more humane and sustainable agricultural practices) and the broader fast-food industry that is portrayed as having debased the time-honored practice of farming in the name of speed, efficiency, and cost reduction. In this way, Chipotle aligned itself not with the interests of the fast-food industry at large, but with activist groups who are seeking to reform the broader system of industrialized food production. Chipotle further reinforced the credibility of their reflexive strategy by investing additional resources to support the broader cause (i.e., creating a synergy between the reflexive and the perfective strategy).</p><a id="AN0158338734-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-23" title="Humanistic rebel strategy">Humanistic rebel strategy</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This strategy promotes the brand as a means for reconstituting meaningful social connections and breaking down societal boundaries that artificially separate people.

These campaigns embed its conscious capitalist commitments to sustainability and support of social justice issues, such as gender equity and LGBTQ rights, in a home-as-haven brand narrative. In these ads, the IKEA-furnished home represents a therapeutic space where people can, at least temporarily, unplug from the stresses and distractions of the "networked life" ([88], p. 17) and experience meaningful human connections and emotional fulfillment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More than just a haven, however, IKEA often portrays the home as an active force that keeps at bay the outside forces that would interfere with the pleasures of slow living. In an ad titled "Home Is a Haven," we see a father and daughter running to their house during a rainstorm. As they approach the front door, the child's teddy bears spring to life as human-sized entities (whose muscular physiques resemble bouncers at a club). The bears rearrange the house into an open play area and protect the dad from intrusive calls and other outside distractions. We watch as father and daughter play dress-up and numerous other games, eventually falling asleep after their fully engaged bonding time (https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGgcYNlH02g">www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGgcYNlH02g</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">IKEA's "Let's Relax" commercial presents a pointedly critical take on the performative, competitive affectations of Instagram micro-influencers, for whom everyday social activities are treated as an instrumental means to garner likes and followers. In the ad, we first observe an eighteenth-century family about to begin formal dinner in a very well-appointed dining room. Suddenly, the father halts the proceedings so that an artist can paint a portrait of the meal, which is immediately transported across the town in a horse-drawn carriage so that affirmative thumbs up gestures from the populace can be tabulated. The scene then suddenly shifts to a modern-day kitchen table, where the same father meticulously photographs the family meal, while his wife and children begrudgingly wait for this documenting ritual to end. The dad sheepishly retires his camera, and the family begins their more enjoyable and authentic social interactions, all framed by the closing caption: "Relax: It's a meal, not a competition" (https://<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BXRGzjo1%5fQ">www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BXRGzjo1%5fQ</a>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing on our semiotic framework, we anticipate that conscious capitalist brands would gain the most authenticating benefit from the humanistic rebel strategy when they present their brands as ideological allies ([48]; [49]) of consumers who are sensitized to the psychological and social costs of careerism, exclusionary status hierarchies, and the calculated practices of social media self-presentations. In this way, the humanistic rebel strategy undercuts the elitist critique by suggesting that a conscious capitalist brand enables consumers to tap into more basic and rewarding emotional and sensory experiences. It further emphasizes that helping people, from all walks of life, feel genuinely connected to each other is an important and accessible way to make the world a better place.</p><a id="AN0158338734-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338734-24" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing from structural semiotics ([40]), we have developed a conceptual framework that can be used to analyze the cultural contradictions of authenticity, as they emerge in a given market context, and then to identify strategies for combatting their disauthenticating associations.

When negotiating such dynamism, marketing managers need to identify strategically significant patterns in the flux of cultural change and to adroitly react to cultural flash points, competitive shifts, and other exogenous shocks that could undermine the credibility of their existing authenticity claims. Whether undertaken in the context of conscious capitalist brands, status-marketing luxury goods, price-driven big-box retailers, or sharing-economy enterprises such as Uber or Airbnb, marketing managers can use our semiotic approach to more effectively negotiate the sociocultural complexity inherent to the process of authenticating their strategic assets.</p><a id="AN0158338734-25"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0158338734-25" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Rob Kozinets</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  For purposes of expositional clarity, our analysis will not explicitly highlight these two paths of contradictory relations.

In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel "word-of-machine" effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person's unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a–b).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: algorithms; artificial intelligence; augmented intelligence; hedonic and utilitarian consumption; recommendations; technology</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Recommendations driven by artificial intelligence (AI) are pervasive in today's marketplace. Ten years ago, Amazon introduced its innovative item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which generates recommendations by scanning through a person's past purchased or rated items and pairing them to similar items. Since then, more and more companies are leveraging advances in AI, machine learning, and natural language processing capabilities to provide relevant and in-the-moment recommendations. For example, Netflix and Spotify use AI and deep learning to monitor a user's choices and provide recommendations of movies or music. Beauty brands such as Proven, Curology, and Function of Beauty use AI to make recommendations about skincare, haircare, and makeup. Real estate services such as OJO Labs, REX Real Estate, and Roof.ai have replaced human real estate agents with chatbots powered by AI. AI-driven recommendations are also pervading the public sector. For example, the New York City Department of Social Services uses AI to give citizens recommendations about disability benefits, food assistance, and health insurance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In response to the proliferation of AI-enabled recommendations and building on long-standing research on actuarial judgments ([12]; [17]; [30]), recent marketing research has focused on whether consumers will be receptive to algorithmic advice in various domains ([<a id="bib9up

However, no prior empirical investigation has systematically explored if hedonic/utilitarian trade-offs in decision making determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based (vs. human-based) recommendations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We focus our investigation on hedonic/utilitarian attribute trade-offs because of their influence on both consumer choice and attitudes ([<a id="bib6up

Specifically, we examine when and why hedonic/utilitarian attribute trade-offs in decision making influence whether people prefer or resist AI recommenders. This question is of pivotal importance for managers operating in both the private and public sectors who are looking to harness the potential of AI-driven recommendations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across nine studies and using a broad array of both attitudinal and behavioral measures, we provide evidence of a "word-of-machine" effect. We define "word of machine" as the phenomenon by which hedonic/utilitarian attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. We suggest that the word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief about differential competence perceptions regarding AI and human recommenders. Specifically, we show that people believe AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders to assess utilitarian attribute value and generate utilitarian-focused recommendations. By contrast, people believe that AI recommenders are less competent than human recommenders to assess hedonic attribute value and generate hedonic-focused recommendations. As a consequence, and as compared with human recommenders, individuals are more (less) likely to choose AI recommenders when utilitarian (hedonic) attributes are important or salient, such as when a utilitarian (hedonic) goal is activated.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research is both theoretically novel and substantively impactful. A first set of theoretical contributions relates to research on the psychology of automation and on human–technology interaction ([12]; [17]; [30]). The pervasiveness of AI-driven recommendations has led to a burgeoning body of research examining whether consumers are receptive to the advice of algorithms, statistical models, and artificial intelligence ([14]; [24]; [27]). With respect to this literature, we make three novel contributions. First, we extend it by addressing the previously unexplored question of when and why hedonic/utilitarian trade-offs in decision making influence preference for or resistance to AI recommenders. Second, we show under what circumstances AI-driven recommendations are preferred to, and therefore more effective, than human ones: when utilitarian attributes are relatively more important or salient than hedonic ones. These results are especially noteworthy, as most research in this area has documented a robust and generalized resistance to algorithmic advice (for exceptions, see [<a id="bib9up

Third, we explore under what circumstances consumers will be amenable to AI recommenders in the context of human–AI partnerships: when AI supports rather than replaces a human. These results are also novel as researchers have just begun devising AI systems capable of deciding when to defer (vs. not defer) to a human ([18]), and empirical investigations are yet to examine if consumers will embrace such hybrid human–AI decision making.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research makes a second theoretical contribution to the literature on hedonic and utilitarian consumption ([<a id="bib1up

However, research in this area has not addressed the question of whether shifts in hedonic/utilitarian trade-offs in decision making determine preference for the source of a recommendation (e.g., an AI vs. a human recommender). Recent developments of AI have brought this question to the fore, making it of critical importance for companies seeking to leverage the potential of AI-driven recommendations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a managerial perspective, our results are useful for companies in both the private and public sectors that are looking to leverage AI recommenders to better reach their customers. As we investigate when consumers prefer AI over human recommenders, our findings are useful for companies debating if and how to effectively leverage AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings have implications for a host of marketing decisions. For instance, our results indicate that a shift away from hedonic attributes and toward utilitarian attributes leads to consumers preferring AI recommenders. Accordingly, AI recommenders may be more aligned with functional positioning strategies than experiential ones. In addition, emphasizing utilitarian benefits may be relatively more impactful with an AI-based system than emphasizing hedonic benefits. Taken together, our research and findings provide actionable insights for managers looking for ways to leverage AI to orchestrate consumer journeys so as to successfully move customers through the funnel, increase the likelihood of successful transactions, and, overall, optimize the customer experience at each phase of the journey.</p><a id="AN0154071460-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-2" title="Theoretical Development">Theoretical Development</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0154071460-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-3" title="Hedonic and Utilitarian Consumption">Hedonic and Utilitarian Consumption</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although consumption involves both hedonic and utilitarian considerations, consumers tend to view products as either predominantly hedonic or utilitarian (for a review, see [23]).

Hedonic value assessment should map onto criteria on the basis of experiential, emotional, and sensory evaluative dimensions. By contrast, utilitarian value assessment should map onto criteria on the basis of factual, rational, and logical evaluative dimensions. This assumption is rooted in the very definition of hedonic and utilitarian value. Hedonic value is conceptualized as reflecting experiential affect associated with a product, sensory enjoyment, and emotions ([<a id="bib4up

We suggest that people believe AI recommenders are more competent to assess utilitarian attribute value than human recommenders and less competent to assess hedonic attribute value than human recommenders. We attribute this lay belief to differing associations people have about how AI (vs. human) recommenders process and evaluate information. Lay beliefs are developed either directly through personal experience ([36]) or indirectly from the environment ([32]). Throughout childhood we learn firsthand that, as humans, we are able to perceive and connect with the outside world through our affective experiences. By contrast, we learn that AI, computers, and robots are rational and logical, and lack the ability to have affective, experiential interactions with the world. These associations are reflected in idioms such as "thinking like a robot," which refers to thinking logically without taking into consideration more "human" aspects of a situation such as sensations and emotions. Thus, whereas AI and computers are associated with rationality and logic, humans are associated with emotions and experiential abilities. These associations are also echoed in books, songs, and movies. For example, in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe, the artificially intelligent form of life named Data has superior intellective abilities but is unable to experience emotions. Popular movies like <em>Her</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>, and <em>Terminator</em> further reinforce these associations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Accordingly, we suggest that people believe AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders when assessing information because they use criteria that rely relatively more on facts, rationality, logic, and, overall, cognitive evaluative dimensions. By contrast, we propose that people believe human recommenders are more competent than AI recommenders when assessing information because they use criteria that rely relatively more on sensory experience, emotions, intuition, and, overall, affective evaluative dimensions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because people perceive AI and humans to have different competency levels when assessing information, and because assessment of utilitarian and hedonic attribute value underscore different evaluative foci, it follows that people perceive AI and humans to have different competency levels with respect to assessing utilitarian and hedonic attributes. This lay belief about competence perceptions forms the basis for the proposed word-of-machine effect. In summary, we predict that if utilitarian (hedonic) attributes are more important or salient, such as when a utilitarian (hedonic) goal is activated, people will be more (less) likely to choose AI recommenders than human recommenders.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A final note warrants mention. As competence perceptions driving the word-of-machine effect are based on a lay belief, they are embedded in the cultural context. That is, humans are not necessarily less competent than AI at assessing and evaluating utilitarian attributes. Vice versa, AI is not necessarily less competent than humans at assessing and evaluating hedonic attributes. Indeed, AI selects flower arrangements for 1-800-Flowers and creates new flavors for food companies such as McCormick, Starbucks, and Coca-Cola ([41]).</p><a id="AN0154071460-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-6" title="Overview of Studies">Overview of Studies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Studies 1a–b focus on product choice in field settings and show the main word-of-machine effect: that AI (human) recommenders lead to greater choice likelihood when a utilitarian (hedonic) goal is activated.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that consumers view the task of matching a recommendation to one's unique preferences as being better performed by a person than by AI.[10] This argument is in line with recent research in the medical domain showing that consumers perceive AI as less able than a human physician to tailor a medical recommendation to their unique characteristics and circumstances ([27]). Thus, we expected people to choose AI recommenders at a lower rate and, conversely, choose human recommenders at a higher rate if matching to unique preferences was salient, even in the case of an activated utilitarian goal. In other words, if matching to unique preferences was salient, we expected people to prefer a human recommender for both hedonic and utilitarian goals. We tested this possibility by manipulating whether participants' desire to have a recommendation matched to their unique needs and preferences was salient and then measuring their choice of recommender.</p><a id="AN0154071460-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-29" title="Procedure">Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Five hundred forty-five respondents (M<sub>age</sub> = 39.0 years, SD = 12.9; 46.6% female) from Amazon Mechanical Turk participated in exchange for monetary compensation in a 2 (goal: hedonic, utilitarian) x 2 (matching: unique preferences, control) between-subjects design.

We address this question across nine studies and show a word-of-machine effect: the phenomenon by which hedonic and utilitarian trade-offs determine preference for (or resistance to) AI-driven recommendations. Studies 1a–1b show that a utilitarian (hedonic) goal makes people more (less) likely to choose AI recommenders than human ones. Study 2 shows that AI (human) recommenders lead to higher perceptions of utilitarian (hedonic) attributes upon consumption. Study 3 shows that people prefer AI (human) recommenders when utilitarian (hedonic) attributes are more important. Study 4 shows that differing competence perceptions underlie the word-of-machine effect and rule out complexity. Studies 5 and 6 identify boundary conditions: Study 5 shows that the word-of-machine effect is reversed for utilitarian goals if the recommendation needs to match a person's unique preferences, and Study 6 shows that the effect is eliminated when AI is framed as "augmented" rather than "artificial" intelligence, that is, in human–AI hybrid decision making. Finally, Studies 7a–7b tested an intervention to attenuate the word-of-machine effect.</p><a id="AN0154071460-44"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-44" title="Theoretical Contributions">Theoretical Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research makes several important theoretical contributions. A first set of contributions speaks to research on the psychology of automation and on human–technology interactions ([12]; [17]; [30]). First, we extend this literature by addressing the question of whether hedonic/utilitarian trade-offs in decision making drive preference for or resistance to AI recommenders. This question is novel, as prior research has not relied on differences inherent to hedonic/utilitarian consumption to predict people's reactions to receiving advice from automated systems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we show under what circumstances AI-driven recommendations are preferred to, and therefore more effective, than human ones: when utilitarian attributes are relatively more important or salient than hedonic ones. Research in this area has largely focused on consumers' resistance to automated systems. For example, in the domain of performance forecasts, people are less likely to rely on the input of an algorithm than a person to make predictions about student performance, an effect that is due to the belief that algorithms, unlike people, cannot learn from their mistakes ([14]). In the domain of health care utilization, people are less likely to rely on an automated medical provider if a human provider is available, even when the two providers have the same accuracy ([27], [28]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Limited research has identified under what circumstances resistance to algorithmic advice is attenuated: if people have the opportunity to modify algorithms and thus exert control over them ([15]), if the human likeness of algorithms is increased ([<a id="bib9up

We extend this literature by showing circumstances in which consumers' resistance to AI may be reversed and by showing cases in which consumers even prefer automated systems: when they assign greater importance to utilitarian attributes or when a utilitarian goal is activated.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we explore under what circumstances consumers will be amenable to AI recommenders in the context of human–AI partnerships. We show that augmented intelligence helps bolster AI to the level of humans for hedonic decision making and helps bolster humans to the level of AI for utilitarian decision making. This contribution is important because it represents the first empirical test of augmented intelligence as an alternative conceptualization of artificial intelligence that focuses on AI's assistive role in advancing human capabilities. We hope that this contribution will prioritize new research focused on understanding the potential of AI in conjunction with humans rather than in contraposition, as this seems to be the advocated way forward by many practitioners ([<a id="bib3up

Literature in this area has identified the factors that influence evaluation of hedonic and utilitarian product dimensions. We extend this literature by investigating how hedonic/utilitarian attribute trade-offs influence the effectiveness of a source of a product recommendation (i.e., a human vs. an AI recommender; Studies 1a, 1b, 3–5) and how the source of a product recommendation influences hedonic/utilitarian perceptions (Studies 2, 6–7b).</p><a id="AN0154071460-45"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-45" title="Managerial Implications">Managerial Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The current speed of development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing algorithms challenge managers to harness these transformative technologies to optimize the customer experience. Our findings are insightful for managers as they navigate the remarkable technology-enabled opportunities that are growing in today's marketplace. These new technologies are also experiencing a renewed prominence in public discourse. For instance, the U.S. government has established the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategy to address economic and social implications of AI.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our findings provide useful insights for both companies and public policy organizations debating if and how to effectively automate their recommendations systems. A company like Sephora relies both on human-based recommendations from sales associates and its customer base and AI-based recommendations through its Visual Artist app, a conversational bot that interacts with prospective shoppers. Our results suggest cases in which AI-based recommendations would be more effective (i.e., when utilitarian attributes are more salient or important, such as grooming products) and when they would be less effective (i.e., when hedonic attributes are more salient or important, such as fragrances).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our results are insightful for strategic and tactical marketing decisions. Marketers could prioritize functional positioning strategies over experiential ones in the case of AI-based recommendations for target segments for whom utilitarian attributes are more important. For instance, a company in the hospitality industry such as TripAdvisor should emphasize AI-based recommendations for business travel services and deemphasize AI-based recommendations for leisure travel services. Our results also apply to a host of tactical decisions such as marketing communications. Managers could communicate to their customers in a way that is aligned with a target segment's goal (i.e., hedonic vs. utilitarian) and emphasize the most effective points of parity/difference with competing brands or across different products in the portfolio. Companies like Netflix and YouTube could emphasize AI-based recommendations when utilitarian attributes are relatively more important (e.g., documentaries) and human-based recommendations ("similar users") when hedonic attributes are relatively more important (e.g., horror movies).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research also highlights boundary conditions that may prove useful for practitioners. Study 5 indicated that when consumers want recommendations that are matched to their unique preferences, they resist AI recommenders and instead prefer human recommenders, regardless of hedonic or utilitarian goals. These results suggest that companies whose customers are known to be satisfied with "one size fits all" recommendations, or who are not in need of a high level of customization, may rely on AI systems. However, companies whose customers are known to desire personalized recommendations should rely on humans. Some companies, such as Amazon, seem to be implementing a similar strategy. Even though most of Amazon's recommendations are based on algorithms, the company has recently started offering an additional service for an added fee called "personal shopper." This service relies on human shopping assistants to give clothing recommendations rather than on algorithms. Our results indicate that more companies, especially those in markets that are relatively more hedonic, should follow Amazon's example.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 6 provides another managerially relevant boundary condition: augmented intelligence. The results of this study indicate that consumers are more receptive to AI recommenders, even in the case of hedonic goals, if the AI recommender does not replace a human recommender but instead assists a human recommender who retains the role of ultimate decision maker. These results are important for practitioners managing relatively more hedonic products or services. For instance, in a personal conversation with the authors, a Walmart marketing manager noted how the top two most frequently ignored recommendations on the company's website are those for alcoholic beverages and food items—arguably products for which hedonic attributes tend to be more salient and important. In these circumstances, practitioners could leverage our results and utilize AI systems to generate an initial recommendation on which a human then "signs off."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, in Studies 7a–7b we tested an intervention that practitioners managing relatively more hedonic products and relying on AI systems may execute. Building on the consider-the-opposite protocol, we created a realistic chatbot that interacted with participants and nudged them to consider that the AI recommender could be good at things that participants did not expect it to be good at. The intervention was successful in both studies, suggesting that practitioners may utilize this technique if hedonic attributes are important.</p><a id="AN0154071460-46"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-46" title="Limitations and Future Research">Limitations and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite the robustness of the word-of-machine effect, our research has limitations that offer several opportunities for future research. First, there is the possibility that drawing attention to the source of a recommendation primed study participants. AI recommenders might have primed utilitarian attributes or made utilitarian goals more salient, and it was the associated increased activation of these concepts, rather than competence perceptions, that gave rise to the word-of-machine effect. Although possible, this alternative explanation based on priming is unlikely given the results of a study we report in Web Appendix D. In this study (N = 230), we first primed participants with either human or AI-related concepts by drawing their attention to either a human or an AI recommender, thus approximating the kind of priming that could have occurred in our studies. To assess whether the AI recommender primed utilitarian concepts, we then measured perceptions of utilitarian and hedonic attributes of a stimulus in a domain unrelated to one in which the priming manipulation occurred. This stimulus was pretested to be neutral (i.e., perceived to be equally utilitarian and hedonic). The results indicate that the stimulus was perceived to be equally utilitarian and hedonic regardless of the priming manipulation. Although these results offer preliminary evidence that priming does not account for the word-of-machine effect, the inferences one can draw from a null effect are limited. More broadly, the question of whether AI-based recommendations activate specific constructs that might be influential on decision making is a worthy avenue for future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, even though we tested the word-of-machine effect across multiple domains, there remains the possibility that the effect is stronger or weaker in certain categories. For instance, the effect might be stronger in categories (e.g., a chocolate cake) in which discerning hedonic attributes (e.g., how tasty or how indulgent it is) is easier than discerning utilitarian attributes (e.g., how many macronutrients it contains, or how healthy it is). Future research could more systematically investigate what dimensions of different product categories strengthen versus weaken the word-of-machine effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the lay beliefs underlying the word-of-machine effect may be transitional. As competence perceptions driving the word-of-machine effect are based on a lay belief, they are embedded in a cultural view that may change over time. The lay belief about differential competence perceptions may already be inaccurate, as AI is already utilized in domains that are relatively more hedonic. For instance, AI curates flower arrangements on the basis of customers' past transactions and inferred preferences (1-800-Flowers) and creates new flavors for food companies such as McCormick, Starbucks, and Coca-Cola ([41]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research also suggests opportunities for future exploration of this area. First, the word-of-machine effect may have interesting downstream consequences on other responses. For instance, relying on an AI recommender may lead consumers to compensate by adjusting their own choices. Given the belief that AI-based recommendations excel on utilitarian attributes and are weaker on hedonic attributes, consumers may choose from a set of options by paying closer attention to the hedonic attributes of the options, assuming that the options are satisfactory in terms of utilitarian attributes. This "second-step choice" is an interesting question to consider in the future.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, in Studies 7a–b we show preliminary evidence of how lay beliefs toward AI systems could be successfully alleviated through a protocol utilized in the decision making literature. Future research could identify other real-world variables that might have similar attenuating effects, such as domain expertise, involvement, time spent making decisions, or familiarity/repeated use of AI systems. A third fruitful research opportunity would be to explore whether consumers can be persuaded to trust AI systems, even more than humans, in the eventuality that AI systems are sufficiently sophisticated to pass the Turing test. In this vein, future research could identify conditions under which the word-of-machine effect reverses, with AI recommenders being more persuasive than humans for hedonic products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As research on the psychology of automation expands to include developments such as AI, we hope that our findings (especially those of Study 6) will spur further research prioritizing the understanding of the vast potential of AI operating in partnership with humans. More research is also necessary to map out the impact of AI systems across consumption settings. AI-powered technologies will be instrumental in optimizing the customer experience at each phase of the consumer journey by offering products of increasing personalization ([41]). New technologies like image, text, and voice recognition, together with large-scale A/B testing will provide managers with the data necessary for a complete, AI-driven customization of the journey ([41]) and will allow researchers to gather the consumer signals that are produced as a by-product of consumer activities ([38]). We hope that future research will focus on how to harness this great potential of AI for managers and researchers alike.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, understanding when consumers will be amenable to and when they will resist AI-driven recommendations is a pressing and complex endeavor for researchers and firms alike. We hope that our research will spur further exploration of this important topic.</p><a id="AN0154071460-47"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071460-47" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, WOM_Web_Appendix_PDF - Artificial Intelligence in Utilitarian vs. Hedonic Contexts: The "Word-of-Machine" Effect</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, WOM_Web_Appendix_PDF for Artificial Intelligence in Utilitarian vs. Hedonic Contexts: The "Word-of-Machine" Effect by Chiara Longoni and Luca Cian in Journal of Marketing</p><a id="AN0154071460-48"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0154071460-48" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  All authors contributed equally.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  Connie Pechmann</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  Luca Cian https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8051-1366</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib6"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6up" id="bib_upbib6" title="6">6</a>  https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242920957347</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib7"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7up" id="bib_upbib7" title="7">7</a>  We thank the associate editor and two anonymous reviewers for this suggestion.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib8"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8up" id="bib_upbib8" title="8">8</a>  We added manipulation checks at the end of the survey.

Although firms are keen to invest in AR, research documenting its tangible impact in real-world contexts is sparse. In this article, the authors outline four broad uses of the technology in retail settings. They then focus specifically on the use of AR to facilitate product evaluation prior to purchase and empirically investigate its impact on sales in online retail. Using data obtained from an international cosmetics retailer, they find that AR usage on the retailer's mobile app is associated with higher sales for brands that are less popular, products with narrower appeal, and products that are more expensive. In addition, the effect of AR is stronger for customers who are new to the online channel or product category, suggesting that the sales increase is coming from online channel adoption and category expansion. These findings provide converging evidence that AR is most effective when product-related uncertainty is high, demonstrating the technology's potential to increase sales by reducing uncertainty and instilling purchase confidence. To encourage more impactful research in this area, the authors conclude with a research agenda for AR in marketing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: augmented reality; mobile app; online retail; product uncertainty; virtual product experience</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"At some point, we're going to look back and think, how did</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">we not have a digital layer on the physical world?" – Greg Jones, Director of VR and AR at Google</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that superimposes virtual objects onto a live view of physical environments, helping users visualize how these objects would fit into their physical world.

Jumping on the bandwagon, Facebook recently introduced AR-enabled display advertisements for their News Feed ([11]), making the technology even more accessible to companies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a retail perspective, a promising application of AR is to facilitate product evaluation by letting customers experience products virtually prior to purchase. Although research has emphasized the importance of direct product experiences to help customers learn about product benefits and assess product fit ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref7" title="6">6</a>]; [12]), offering direct product experiences can be a logistical challenge, especially in online retail. The introduction of AR has made it possible for shoppers to experience products virtually in the absence of physical products, managing their expectations and instilling purchase confidence ([44]). For example, Amazon and IKEA are using this technology to help customers determine if products or furniture pieces offered online are compatible with their existing room décor, and L'Oréal and Sephora are using AR to show customers how different cosmetic products would alter their appearance. Some of these applications are illustrated in Web Appendix A.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite the keen interest in AR, there has been limited research demonstrating its tangible impact in real-world contexts. Understanding the potential for AR to increase revenues is important for justifying investments in this new technology. However, the impact of AR on actual product sales is still ambiguous. By helping customers visualize products in their consumption contexts, AR could reduce product fit uncertainty, resulting in more sales. Conversely, AR may also discourage purchases if it leads to perceptions that the products may not fit well. As the technology is unable to convey experiential product attributes that could be important in purchase decisions (e.g., product texture or scent), the impact of AR on sales could also be insignificant. This uncertainty surrounding the impact of AR has been cited as one of the main reasons why companies are still hesitant to embrace the technology, even though most recognize the exciting opportunities it offers ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref10" title="5">5</a>]). Echoing this lack of clarity, a recent CNN article regarding applications of AR in the cosmetics industry expressed that "virtual lipsticks and smokey eye shadows are popular in apps, but are they translating into more makeup sales? Hard data isn't easy to come by" ([38]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore, whether and how the impact of AR varies across different products or customer segments is also unclear. Having a more nuanced understanding of how AR affects sales would help marketing managers determine when it would be most appropriate to deploy the technology. Conceivably, if AR increases sales by reducing uncertainty, its impact may depend on product and customer characteristics that influence uncertainty in purchase decisions, such as brand popularity, product appeal, and customers' familiarity with the retail channel or category. Accordingly, the present research adopts the retailers' perspective to examine the following questions:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal"> How does the use of AR to facilitate product evaluation impact product sales?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> How does the sales impact of AR usage differ across product characteristics, such as brand popularity, product appeal, rating, and price?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> How do customers' prior experiences with the online channel and product category influence the sales impact of AR usage?</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given that AR is predominantly available on mobile apps ([43]), we focus on the mobile app platform for our analyses. We obtained data from an international cosmetics retailer that incorporated AR into its mobile app to help customers realistically visualize how they would look when they are using different cosmetic products (e.g., eyeshadows, lipsticks). The data contain sales records for 2,300 products, as well as browsing and purchase histories for 160,400 customers, allowing us to investigate how the sales impact of AR varies by product and customer characteristics. In addition, introduction of the AR feature for two product categories during the observation period provided us with a quasi-experimental setting to examine the impact of AR introduction on category sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Findings from our research provide preliminary evidence that AR usage has a positive impact on product sales. The overall impact appears to be small, but certain products are more likely to benefit from the technology than others. In particular, the impact of AR is stronger for brands that are less popular and products with narrower appeal, suggesting that AR could level the playing field for niche brands or products (sometimes referred to as products in the "long tail" of the product sales distribution; e.g., [<a id="bib8up

The increase in sales is also greater for products that are more expensive, indicating that AR could increase overall revenues for retailers. In addition, customers who are new to the online channel or product category are more likely to purchase after using AR, suggesting that AR has the potential to promote online channel adoption and category expansion. These findings provide converging evidence that AR is most effective when product-related uncertainty is high, implying that uncertainty reduction could be a possible mechanism by which AR could improve sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article is one of the first to empirically demonstrate the impact of AR on sales and how it varies across product and customer characteristics using real-world data. In doing so, it extends prior studies on AR in the marketing field and represents an initial step in understanding what AR means for marketers and retailers. Beyond influencing sales, AR could transform the way brands reach out to and connect with customers at different stages of the customer journey. In the following section, we provide an overview of AR and elaborate on four ways the technology can be incorporated into brands' marketing strategies to reshape the customer retail experience. Then, we focus specifically on how the use of AR to facilitate product evaluation prior to purchase impacts sales in online retail. To encourage marketing academics to further engage in impactful and managerially relevant research in this area, we conclude with a research agenda that we developed in consultation with industry experts and marketing practitioners.</p><a id="AN0154071467-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-2" title="Augmented Reality">Augmented Reality</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0154071467-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-3" title="Augmented Reality Technology">Augmented Reality Technology</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Augmented reality integrates virtual elements into real-world environments to create alternate perceptions of reality. Using sensors and object recognition capabilities from input devices such as cameras, AR technology scans the physical environment, identifies features in the environment, and superimposes virtual objects (e.g., two- or three-dimensional images or animations, text, sounds) on top of a live view of the real world. By blending virtual elements into physical environments in real time, AR enriches users' visual and auditory perceptions of reality. In most cases, the virtual elements are also responsive to movements or gestures, creating an interactive experience for users.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although AR is often classified together with VR, the two technologies are distinct, both in how they function and the way they are experienced. Unlike AR, which receives input from the real world and adds virtual elements to it, VR immerses users in a completely digital and artificial environment, shutting them out from their surroundings. Due to the disorienting experience of being entirely isolated from the real world and the expensive headsets required ([19]), the appeal of VR has largely been limited to industries with products high in simulated content, such as gaming and entertainment ([13]). In contrast, AR allows users to experience virtual elements without the vulnerability of being blind to the real world. In addition, AR can be experienced directly from handheld devices that users already own (e.g., tablets or smartphones). Thus, AR is rapidly gaining prominence, and close to 100 million U.S. consumers are expected to use the technology regularly by 2022 ([43]).</p><a id="AN0154071467-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-4" title="Augmented Reality in Retail">Augmented Reality in Retail</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The unique capabilities of AR present marketers with new opportunities to engage customers and transform the brand experience.

Besides generating hype and interest, marketers have also used AR-enabled experiences to drive traffic to their physical locations. For example, Walmart collaborated with media companies such as DC Comics and Marvel to bring exclusive superhero-themed AR experiences to their stores by placing special thematic displays in selected outlets. In addition to creating novel and engaging experiences for customers, it also encouraged them to explore different areas within the stores.</p><a id="AN0154071467-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-6" title="Educate">Educate</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Due to its interactive and immersive format, AR is also an effective medium for delivering content and information to customers. For instance, to help customers better appreciate their new car models, Toyota and Hyundai have utilized AR to demonstrate key features and innovative technologies in a vivid and visually appealing manner. Retailers can also use AR to help customers navigate stores or highlight relevant product information to influence their in-store purchase decisions. Companies such as Walgreen's and Lowe's have developed in-store navigation apps that overlay directional signals onto a live view of the path in front of users to guide them to product locations and notify them if there are special promotions along the way.</p><a id="AN0154071467-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-7" title="Evaluate">Evaluate</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By retaining the physical environment as a backdrop to virtual elements, AR also helps users visualize how products would appear in their actual consumption contexts, allowing them to more accurately assess product fit prior to purchase. For example, IKEA's Place app uses AR to give customers a preview of different furniture pieces in their homes by overlaying true-to-scale, three-dimensional models of products onto a live view of the room. Customers can easily determine if a product fits in a given space without the hassle of taking measurements. Fashion retailers Uniqlo and Topshop have also deployed the same technology in their physical stores, offering customers greater convenience by reducing the need for them to change in and out of different outfits. An added advantage of AR is its ability to accommodate a wide assortment of products. By replacing tangible product displays with lifelike virtual previews of products, retailers can overcome the constraints of physical space while still offering customers the opportunity to explore different product options. This capability is particularly useful for made-to-order or bulky products. Car manufacturers BMW and Audi have used AR to provide customers with true-to-scale, three-dimensional visual representations of car models based on customizable features such as paint color, wheel design, and interior aesthetics. These cases exemplify AR's huge potential to increase customers' confidence in their purchase decisions for a variety of products.</p><a id="AN0154071467-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-8" title="Enhance">Enhance</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Lastly, AR can be used to enhance and redefine the way products are experienced or consumed after they have been purchased. For example, LEGO recently launched several brick sets that are specially designed to combine physical and virtual gameplay. Through the companion AR app, animated LEGO characters spring to life and interact with the physical LEGO sets, creating a whole new playing experience. In a bid to address skepticism about the quality of its food ingredients, McDonald's has also used AR to let customers discover the origins of ingredients in the food they purchased via storytelling and three-dimensional animations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The present research focuses on the use of AR to help customers evaluate products prior to purchase. Specifically, we explore the possibility of leveraging AR to reduce product-related uncertainty in online purchase decisions. To extend prior research on AR in retail (summarized in Table 2), we use real-world data to examine how customers' use of AR to try products (for brevity, we refer to this as "AR usage" for the rest of the article) affects product and brand sales.

Unlike in traditional retail settings, customers are unable to physically inspect or evaluate products before making a purchase, resulting in greater uncertainty that the products would be able to deliver the expected level of performance or benefits ([<a id="bib6up

Product performance uncertainty occurs when customers are unable to evaluate or predict product performance due to imperfect knowledge ([17]). In contrast, product fit uncertainty occurs when customers are unable to determine if the product matches their needs ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref29" title="6">6</a>]; [32]). The latter form of uncertainty is typically higher for products with experience attributes (i.e., attributes that can only be evaluated after the product has been experienced; [32]), such as apparel or beauty products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several mechanisms to reduce product performance uncertainty in online retail have been suggested. For example, retailers could lower information asymmetry by providing diagnostic product descriptions or by including credibility signals such as third-party product assurances, warranties, or customer reviews ([17]; [51]). In contrast, product fit uncertainty typically requires direct product experience to resolve, as it is idiosyncratic in nature and varies from individual to individual. Although some retailers have adopted try-before-you-buy programs (e.g., Warby Parker's home try-on program; [<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref34" title="6">6</a>]) or lenient product return policies ([24]; [53]) to provide opportunities for direct product experiences, these measures are notoriously costly for retailers due to the additional shipping and handling costs and risks of product damage ([22]). Furthermore, direct product experiences may not be viable or appropriate for certain products, such as products that are customized (e.g., engagement rings), products that require assembly (e.g., furniture), or personal care products (e.g., cosmetics).</p><a id="AN0154071467-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-11" title="Augmented Reality and Product Uncertainty">Augmented Reality and Product Uncertainty</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The introduction of AR has made it possible to substitute direct product experiences with virtual product experiences to facilitate product evaluation and reduce product fit uncertainty. Using a situated cognition perspective, [29] propose that the value of AR lies in its ability to help customers visually integrate virtual products into the real-world environment (i.e., "environmental embedding") and use bodily movements and physical actions to control how products are presented (i.e., "simulated physical control"). The unique combination of these two properties induces perceptions that the virtual products are physically present in the real world, creating realistic product experiences. Consequently, customers are able to evaluate products as if they are actually interacting with the real products, resulting in reduced product fit uncertainty. In line with this, prior research finds that vivid images and greater control over the presentation of information are effective ways to alleviate uncertainty in online environments ([51]). By helping customers visualize products in their consumption contexts and reducing product fit uncertainty, AR-enabled product experiences increase the level of ease customers feel in the decision-making process, translating to positive behavioral intentions ([26]; [29]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, although AR communicates visual information about products, it is unable to convey other experiential product attributes (e.g., product texture, scent). For example, even though customers may use AR to visualize an IKEA sofa in a room, they are unable to assess how comfortable it is. Similarly, users trying on cosmetic products via AR are unable to evaluate other product attributes such as the texture and consistency of the product, which may affect ease of application and the way the product feels on the skin. According to [34], if customers do not perceive trial experiences as accurately representing actual consumption experiences, they may discount those trial experiences when they form judgments about the product. Thus, the extent to which virtual product experiences involving AR could influence online purchases is unclear. Nevertheless, as prior research has demonstrated the positive effects of providing fit information in online retail (e.g., [21]; [35]), we expect AR usage to have a positive impact on product sales because the technology could convey visual information that may reduce product fit uncertainty in online purchase decisions. Therefore, we predict the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> AR usage has a positive impact on sales.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on the proposition that AR usage increases sales by reducing product fit uncertainty, we further hypothesize that AR would have a stronger impact when customers experience higher levels of uncertainty. In particular, the level of uncertainty experienced in a purchase decision could depend on product characteristics such as brand popularity, product appeal, and ratings. The level of uncertainty may also influence the price that customers are willing to pay for the product. Thus, the relationship between AR usage and sales may differ across these product characteristics. In addition, customers also vary in their need to reduce product fit uncertainty before making a purchase ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref45" title="6">6</a>]). This need to reduce uncertainty could depend on customers' familiarity with the online channel and product category. As a result, the impact of AR may also vary across these customer characteristics. Accordingly, we develop hypotheses for the moderating effects of product and customer characteristics in the following sections. Our conceptual framework is presented in Figure 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1.

Consistent with this, [18] find that cultures high in uncertainty avoidance place greater emphasis on brand credibility. In online environments, brand signals are even more important because consumers are not able to inspect products before purchasing ([16]). However, [31] demonstrates that when additional information is available to facilitate decision making, consumers rely less on brand signals. As a result, less-established brands benefit more from the increased availability of information. In the same vein, by communicating visual information to help customers assess product fit, AR may reduce uncertainty in online purchase decisions. Consequently, AR may decrease customers' reliance on brand signals and inadvertently increase preference for brands that are less popular. We use the term "popular" in a general sense to refer to brands that are more widely adopted. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2a: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for brands that are less popular.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071467-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-14" title="Product appeal">Product appeal</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Within the same category or brand, products may also have different levels of appeal due to the alignment between their inherent characteristics and general consumer preferences. For example, a red lipstick is more mainstream and has broader appeal than a blue lipstick. We draw a distinction between brand popularity and product appeal in that the latter depends on intrinsic properties of the product and could be independent of the brand. Thus, a red lipstick from an unknown brand could have broad appeal but low brand popularity, whereas a blue lipstick from a well-known brand could have limited appeal despite having high brand popularity. As products with broad appeal cater to the masses, they are more likely to match the needs of the general consumer. Conversely, because products with narrower appeal serve a niche segment, there is a higher probability that they will not match the preferences of the general consumer and will thus carry greater product fit uncertainty. Nevertheless, [<a id="bib8up

Consistent with this, [50] find that products with narrower appeal benefit more from greater information availability. By visually conveying product information to help customers assess product fit in an effortless and risk-free environment, AR could have a stronger impact for products with narrower appeal due to the higher product fit uncertainty associated with these products. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2b: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for products with narrower appeal.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071467-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-15" title="Ratings">Ratings</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Customers often turn to online ratings or reviews as a source of information to resolve uncertainty about product quality and fit ([14]). In line with this, [37] find that consumers from countries that are high in uncertainty avoidance are more sensitive to both the valence and volume of product ratings. However, as consumers tend to overrate direct experiences with products ([30]), the ability to evaluate products and resolve uncertainty via firsthand experiences with those products on AR platforms may reduce customers' reliance on online ratings. Thus, by enabling customers to learn about product benefits and assess product fit through their own virtual experiences, AR could diminish the role of online ratings in purchase decisions. As a result, customers may be more amenable to purchasing products despite their lower ratings if they are able to try these products using AR. Therefore, we predict the followsing:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2c: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for products with lower ratings.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071467-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-16" title="Price">Price</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When customers experience product uncertainty, they are not able to accurately assess the benefits the products offer. As a result, customers are more likely to undervalue the products and are less willing to pay a premium ([17]). Consistent with this, [36] find that customers who are familiar with online shopping are still hesitant to purchase expensive products through the internet when there is a high degree of product uncertainty because they could suffer greater financial losses if these products do not fit them well. By facilitating product evaluation prior to purchase, AR helps customers ascertain if products match their needs and preferences. Consequently, customers may experience less uncertainty and feel more comfortable purchasing products that are more expensive. In line with this, [27] find that AR usage improves decision comfort, leading to higher willingness to pay. Therefore, we predict the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H2d: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for more expensive products.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071467-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-17" title="Moderating Effects of Customer Characteristics">Moderating Effects of Customer Characteristics</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0154071467-18"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-18" title="Channel experience">Channel experience</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">According to [36], customers who are familiar with online shopping are more inclined to purchase products with a higher degree of uncertainty because their cumulative online shopping experiences help them develop the ability to assess products when limited information is available. Thus, customers who have purchased from a retailer's online channel in the past may feel more comfortable making subsequent online purchases despite experiencing product uncertainty, potentially making them less dependent on AR to make their purchase decisions. In contrast, customers who are new to the retailer's online channel (but have made prior purchases at the retailer's offline channel) are not accustomed to making purchases in the absence of actual products. As a result, they may experience greater product fit uncertainty and may be deterred from purchasing online due to the inability to assess product fit. Because AR simulates the in-store experience of trying products, it may help reduce product fit uncertainty for customers who are new to the online channel. These customers may derive greater value from the ability to evaluate products virtually, potentially making them more likely to purchase online after using AR. Therefore, we predict the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H3a: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for customers who are new to the retailer's online channel.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0154071467-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-19" title="Category experience">Category experience</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Besides channel experience, customers' familiarity with the product category also affects their level of product fit uncertainty ([32]). Customers who are familiar with a product category can draw on their prior experiences as an information source to form judgments about products ([46]). As a result, they may rely less on AR in their purchase decisions. Conversely, customers who are unfamiliar with a product category lack the necessary category knowledge to evaluate product attributes and, at the same time, may not be aware of their own preferences ([32]). Consequently, these customers will have more difficulty assessing whether a product's attributes match their preferences, resulting in greater product fit uncertainty. By helping customers visualize how products would appear in their actual consumption contexts, AR could reduce product fit uncertainty and increase purchase confidence for customers who are new to the product category. As a result, AR usage may have a stronger impact on the purchase decisions for these customers. Therefore, we predict the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H3b: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The impact of AR usage on sales is stronger for customers who are new to the product category.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To summarize, we propose that AR usage will positively impact sales by reducing product uncertainty.

To test our hypotheses, we obtained data from an international cosmetics retailer with both an online and offline presence. Leveraging AR technology, the retailer integrated a new feature on its existing mobile app that allowed customers to virtually try on makeup products (e.g., eyeshadows, lipsticks). The AR technology detected customers' facial features via their smartphone cameras and superimposed the shade of chosen products onto a live view of their face in real time, giving them a realistic visual representation of their appearance when they are using the products. The brand, product name, and price were displayed at the top of the screen. Figure A3 in Web Appendix A provides a visual example of a customer trying on a lipstick using the AR feature. For comparison, the corresponding product detail page view (i.e., the conventional way of conveying product-related information on mobile retail apps) is also provided. Prior to the start of our observation period in December 2017, the AR feature was only available for lip categories (i.e., lipstick and lip gloss) and was subsequently introduced for eye categories (i.e., eyeshadow and eyeliner) in March 2018. Figure A4 in Web Appendix A provides a visual overview of AR availability for the different categories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We obtained two separate data sets from the retailer for one of its key markets in Asia Pacific. The first data set contained information about browsing activities on the mobile app, including specific products customers tried using the AR feature, and covered a 19-month period from December 2017 to June 2019. The second data set contained transaction records from June 2017 to June 2019 for all retail channels, including mobile app, website, and offline stores. We merged the two using customers' loyalty card number, which allowed us to match AR usage and product purchases at a disaggregate level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">During the 19-month period, a total of 160,407 shoppers browsed products from the lip and eye categories across 806,029 sessions, 20.8% of which involved AR usage. Customers who used AR during the session spent 20.7% more time browsing (M<sub>with_AR</sub> = 16.6 minutes, M<sub>without_AR</sub> = 13.8 minutes, <em>p</em> &lt;.01) and browsed 1.28 times more products (M<sub>with_AR</sub> = 53.9, M<sub>without_AR</sub> = 42.2, <em>p</em> &lt;.01). The purchase rate for sessions with AR usage was 19.8% higher than for sessions without AR usage (3.15% with AR vs. 2.63% without AR, <em>p</em> &lt;.01), providing preliminary indication of the positive impact of AR on sales.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We divide our analyses into three sections. In the first section, we perform the analysis at the product level to examine the moderating effects of brand popularity, product appeal, rating, and price. To minimize selection bias arising from availability of the AR feature, we focus on lipsticks and lip glosses, as the feature was available for &gt; 96% of products in each of these categories. In the second section, we take advantage of the introduction of AR for two eye categories (i.e., eyeshadow and eyeliner) to examine the effect of AR introduction on category sales using a quasi-experimental differences-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) approach. Finally, we investigate how the impact of AR varies at the customer level. As all customers had no knowledge that the AR feature would be introduced for the two eye categories prior to the introduction, the event provided us with a clean setting for examining how customers' channel and category experience (prior to the introduction) would moderate the impact of AR usage on purchase probability.</p><a id="AN0154071467-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-22" title="Product-Level Analysis">Product-Level Analysis</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As product color is an important factor in cosmetic purchases, we considered each shade/color of retail merchandise as a unique product.

Our empirical strategy was to relate the number of customers using AR to try each product during a particular time period with sales volume for that product during the same time period. We estimated the model at the monthly product level, giving us a total of 44,346 observations (2,334 products × 19 months from December 2017 to June 2019).

Underlying this choice of instruments is the assumption that customer preferences are similar across markets and that product-specific factors affecting customers' interest in trying products using the AR feature should be constant in all markets, satisfying the first condition. However, the number of customers using the AR feature to try products in other markets should have no bearing on customers' purchase decisions in the focal market, satisfying the second requirement.

As app activity data prior to the first month (i.e., December 2017) was unavailable, we excluded observations for the first month. Results for this model are presented in Table 4, Column 3, and the findings are consistent. Because we were interested in the moderating effect of ratings, we focused on products that had a rating in the main analysis.

Using a quasi-experimental approach, we regarded AR introduction as a treatment and examined its impact by comparing differences in sales for products with and without the AR feature, before and after the feature was introduced. Because the AR feature was only available for eyeshadows and eyeliners, a potential comparison could be between these categories and other eye categories that did not have the feature (i.e., eyebrows, mascaras, and eye palettes). This between-category comparison relies on the crucial assumption that sales trends across different eye categories would be parallel in the absence of AR introduction. As cosmetic products are often used concurrently, sales for products targeting the same facial feature should generally move in the same direction. Since the AR feature was only available on the mobile app, an alternative comparison could be between the app and web channels. This approach avoids the assumption that trends across different eye categories are similar, but it requires a separate assumption that without AR introduction, sales trends in the two online channels would be parallel.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A more robust approach that does not require either of these assumptions is the DDD approach ([<a id="bib1up

Specifically, the DDD analysis measures differences between app and web sales for eyeshadows and eyeliners before and after AR introduction, relative to the same differences for other eye categories that do not have the AR feature. Thus, the DDD approach controls for both channel and category trends that could potentially confound the effect, and it relies on the more relaxed assumption that in the absence of AR introduction, sales trends in the two online channels would be parallel for products in the same category. Following [33] and [20], we conducted two falsification tests using data from the pre–AR introduction period, and the results provide support that this assumption holds in our study.

Results of this alternative model are presented in Table 5, Column 3, and the coefficient of the three-way interaction of interest is similar in direction, magnitude, and significance with the main model. Although the weekly fixed effects controlled for variations in overall sales between weeks, they did not account for time-varying confounding effects that were specific to the channel-category. Thus, if there were more app-exclusive sale events for the eyeshadow and eyeliner categories in the post–AR introduction period relative to the pre–AR introduction period, the effect of AR Introduction on app sales in these two categories would be overstated. As a robustness check, we removed weeks that coincided with sale events from the analysis and present the results in Table 5, Column 4. We also split AR Feature<sub>j</sub> into the two eye categories with the AR feature, Eyeshadow<sub>j</sub> and Eyeliner<sub>j</sub>, and the coefficients of both three-way interactions are marginally significant, providing convergent validity for our results. Furthermore, results from the Wald test for equality of coefficients fail to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are the same (<em>p</em> =.76), indicating that the effect of AR introduction on sales is not category-specific. Lastly, we estimated the same model using a Poisson regression. Results of these additional analyses are provided in Web Appendix G. Across all robustness analyses, the direction, magnitude, and significance of coefficients are similar to the main model.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, the results provide additional support for H<sub>1</sub> and demonstrate that the positive impact of AR generalizes to other product categories. We note that because the retailer did not announce the introduction of AR for the eye categories, usage of the feature was low. On average, the weekly number of customers using AR to try products from the eye categories was 6.4 times lower than the number for lip categories (M<sub>eyes</sub> = 271.14 vs. M<sub>lips</sub> = 1,737.00). Thus, our result is a conservative estimate of the impact of AR introduction, and we speculate that the effect could have been larger if the retailer had advertised the feature. To establish a direct relationship between AR usage and purchase, and to further examine the moderating effects of customers' channel and category experience, we next turn our attention to the customer level.</p><a id="AN0154071467-31"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-31" title="Customer-Level Analysis">Customer-Level Analysis</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We focused on the sample of active customers (i.e., those who made a purchase in the past one year) who browsed products in the eyeshadow or eyeliner categories during the 12-month period[<a id="bib7up

We used customers' past AR usage for lip products (prior to AR introduction for the eye categories) as the instrument. Customers who had used AR to try lip products in the past were already aware of the feature and could have been more likely to use it again to try eye products. Conversely, customers who had never used the feature to try lip products in the past may have been unaware of it. Because the retailer did not announce the AR introduction for the eye categories, these customers could still have been unaware of the feature. As a result, they would have been less likely to use it to try eye products. Furthermore, because lip and eye products target different areas of the face, past usage of the AR feature to try lip products should not have directly affected the probability of purchasing eye products during the focal period. Thus, we included Past AR Usage<sub>i</sub><sup>lips</sup> as an instrument in the first stage to estimate customer i's likelihood of using AR in the focal period. The variable was coded as 1 if customer i used the AR feature to try lip products in the three months before AR was introduced for the eye categories and 0 otherwise. Residuals from the first-stage estimation were then included in Equation 3 to estimate P(Purchase<sub>i</sub><sup>eyes</sup>). Similar to the product model, we bootstrapped 1,000 samples to obtain the proper standard errors. To examine if the findings are robust to alternative identification strategies, we also adopted the propensity score weighting approach, which does not rely on instruments.

However, the coefficient for the residual correction term, which is equivalent to the Hausman test for the presence of endogeneity ([40]), is not significant, suggesting that endogeneity may not be a concern. We also used the Heckman selection method ([25]) as an alternative identification strategy, and the inverse Mills ratio is similarly not significant.

As prior research has shown that multichannel customers are more profitable ([39]), omnichannel retailers can use AR to encourage their offline customers to adopt the online channel. Given that AR increases online sales among customers who are new to the channel, a potential concern is that AR could lead to cannibalization of sales from offline channels. To understand if the increase in app purchases that we observed was happening at the expense of other sales channels, we ran the same model in Equation 3 but replaced the dependent variable with the probability of purchasing eye products in the web and offline channels (results reported in Web Appendix K). We did not find evidence to indicate that offline customers who use AR (on the app) are more likely to purchase from the web, suggesting that the impact of AR is specific to the app platform. Interestingly, we find that offline customers who use AR are more likely to purchase from the offline channel in the three-month model but not in the six and 12-month model. Thus, contrary to our expectations, the results suggest that AR could have a positive spillover effect to the offline channel, at least in the short run.</p><a id="AN0154071467-41"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-41" title="An Agenda for Future Research">An Agenda for Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Complementing prior research, which has predominantly studied AR from a consumer perspective, our research extends the literature by examining what AR means for retailers. To encourage the academic community to produce more impactful research in this nascent field, we developed a research agenda for AR in marketing, with an emphasis on identifying research topics that have strong managerial relevance for industry practitioners. Drawing on a review of the academic literature (e.g., [52]) and recent advancements in AR technology, we generated a list of potential research topics and synthesized these topics into five themes. Next, we consulted two senior marketing practitioners and two academics with expertise in this area to review the research themes and associated topics, and we refined the list according to their feedback.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To determine the practical importance of each research theme, we conducted an online survey with 36 marketing practitioners from companies that were using (or planning to use) AR in their marketing, advertising, or retailing activities. Survey respondents first independently rated each research theme in terms of importance to business performance (see [47]) before ranking the five research themes from most to least important. To avoid primacy and recency effects, the order of research themes was randomized across respondents. The mean rating (ranging from 5.1 to 5.8 on a seven-point scale) and ranking scores (from 1 to 5; lower number reflects higher importance) are inversely proportional, demonstrating internal consistency. Web Appendix L provides details for the survey, including survey design, respondent recruitment, and background of respondents.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 8 presents the research agenda for AR in marketing, comprising the five research themes (ordered by practical importance) and potential topics that could be explored under each theme. Given the novelty of the technology, marketers were primarily concerned with how different design features could be configured to create more effective AR experiences for consumers. For example, greater clarity is needed regarding factors that affect AR experiences, such as fidelity (i.e., how closely virtual objects resemble real objects), motion (i.e., static vs. animated virtual objects), spatial presence (i.e., the feeling that virtual objects exist in a physical space), and embodiment (i.e., the ability to use bodily movements to control virtual objects), and how these can be delivered on AR interfaces. Beyond visual and auditory senses, how haptic feedback (e.g., emission of vibrations on devices to stimulate the sense of touch) influences AR experiences is also of interest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 8.

Details of the survey are provided in Web Appendix L. "Rating" refers to the mean importance rating score (on a seven-point scale). "Ranking" refers to the mean importance ranking (from 1 to 5; lower number reflects higher importance).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another important consideration is how AR fits into companies' overall marketing strategy. Specifically, marketers would like to know how they can better integrate AR at different stages of the customer journey to increase brand engagement, build emotional connections, and improve relationships with customers. There is also ambiguity regarding the synergy between AR and other elements of the marketing communications mix (e.g., advertising, sales promotions), as well as the effectiveness of product placements and pop-up stores in AR-enabled virtual environments. In particular, the potential for this new technology to complement or replace existing communication and retail channels is still uncertain. As most recent applications of AR have focused on consumer products, marketers also need more guidance on how AR can be appropriately deployed in service industries, such as the tourism and hospitality sector.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Besides these two key areas, other worthwhile avenues to explore include the impact of AR on consumer behavior (e.g., cognitive functions, rational decision making, and brand perceptions), how marketers can promote wider adoption of AR, and how the technology can be used to generate valuable marketing insights. Although our research agenda focuses on AR, we note that the research themes could be broadened to encompass other extended realities (i.e., virtual reality and mixed reality).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, we believe that the marketing community would benefit from a deeper investigation of virtual experiences and their role in marketing. We are excited about where this field is heading, and we look forward to more insightful research to reinforce our understanding of the profound impacts of these new technologies in the marketing domain.</p><a id="AN0154071467-42"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071467-42" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_0022242921995449 - Augmented Reality in Retail and Its Impact on Sales</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental Material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_0022242921995449 for Augmented Reality in Retail and Its Impact on Sales by Yong-Chin Tan, Sandeep R.

The authors suggest that focusing on one's relationships with competitors is a valuable, albeit unexpected, way for brands to do so. More specifically, the present research demonstrates that praising one's competitor—via "brand-to-brand praise"—often heightens preference for the praiser more so than other common forms of communication, such as self-promotion or benevolent information. This is because brand-to-brand praise increases perceptions of brand warmth, which leads to enhanced brand evaluations and choice. The authors support this theory with seven studies conducted in the lab, online, and in the field that feature multiple managerially relevant outcomes, including brand attitudes, social media and advertising engagement, brand choice, and purchase behavior, in a variety of product and service contexts. The authors also identify key boundary conditions and rule out alternative explanations, further elucidating the underlying mechanism and important implementation insights. This work contributes to the understanding of brand perception and warmth, providing a novel way for brands to connect to consumers by connecting with each other.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: praise; brand relationships; brand communication; brand evaluations; warmth and competence</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In 2017, a popular video gaming brand, Xbox, openly congratulated its competitor, Nintendo, on the launch of its new Switch gaming system ([53]). A few months later, <em>The New York Times</em> encouraged readers to read other news sources such as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> ([20]). And, in responding to a playful challenge from Kit Kat, Oreo disarmed the brand by communicating how truly irresistible Kit Kat is ([62]). Conventional wisdom fervently advises that "even mentioning your competition is a bad idea" ([51]), so why have these brands not only mentioned their competitors but praised them?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In a world where brands are trying hard to connect with consumers, many of whom have grown increasingly skeptical of marketers' intentions ([21]), it may be that praising the competition provides unexpected benefits. Our research explores the consequences of brand-to-brand praise—when a brand communicates positively and publicly about another brand. We argue that consumers who observe a brand praising a competitor will believe that the brand has positive intentions toward others, also known as brand warmth, which heightens consumer evaluations and interest in the brand giving the praise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As an introductory illustration of this idea, we scraped data from the Twitter pages of Nintendo and its fiercest competitors, Xbox and PlayStation, around the time of the Nintendo Switch launch in 2017. We found a greater number of likes and retweets (in fact, over ten times as many), as well as more positive sentiment among consumers' comments, when Xbox and PlayStation praised Nintendo for the launch compared with all other types of messages (Web Appendix A). Such preliminary field data motivate our exploration into whether, when, and why brand-to-brand praise affects consumer reactions to brands.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across seven studies, we examine the effects of brand-to-brand praise on consumer attitudes and behavior versus more common forms of brand messaging (e.g., self-promotion or providing helpful information to consumers) and identify important boundaries. In doing so, this research offers several contributions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, we contribute to the brand perception literature by demonstrating how consumers' perceptions of brands are affected by a brand's interactions with other brands. Prior work has focused on how brand-to-<em>consumer</em> interactions affect consumer perceptions (e.g., [42]) but has not yet explored how observing brand-to-<em>brand</em> interactions do so. Furthermore, we contribute to research on the fundamental dimensions by which people judge other people and brands: warmth and competence (e.g., [<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref7" title="1">1</a>]). We identify brand-to-brand praise as a novel antecedent that often leads consumers to perceive brands that praise their competitors as warmer. We show that praising a competitor is viewed as a costly action that does not obviously benefit the praiser, thus making it a credible signal. In doing so, we demonstrate the role of costliness in signaling warmth that effectively combats consumer skepticism, a major barrier to warmth identified in prior research ([18]). We also introduce two moderators—organization type and individual differences in skepticism—to identify when costly displays of warmth are most important.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we further contribute to the literature on warmth and competence by introducing a context in which brand-to-brand praise increases warmth without damaging perceptions of competence. Prior work suggests that warmth and competence are often negatively correlated, particularly in contexts in which people are considering two or more entities ([32]). Leveraging consumers' lay theories about the characteristics of brands that would be willing to praise their competitors, brand-to-brand praise provides an opportunity for brands to communicate warmth while maintaining perceptions of competence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, while prior work has examined brand communication in which the competitive brand is ultimately shown to be inferior, such as in comparative advertising and two-sided messaging campaigns (e.g., [<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref10" title="4">4</a>]; [17]; [40]), our research identifies how directing attention away from one's own brand and toward the competition in a purely positive light affects brand evaluations and choice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we add to the current literature on praise by identifying brand-to-brand communication as a viable and distinct form of praise, noting that observers respond more favorably to praise in a brand-to-brand context than is typically observed in traditional person-to-person contexts. In doing so, we also highlight the understudied effects of praise in competitive relationships. In what follows, we review literature on brand relationships, praise, and brand warmth and present seven studies that test our hypotheses.</p><a id="AN0157259287-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-2" title="Building Consumer–Brand Relationships">Building Consumer–Brand Relationships</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A great deal of research has investigated how brands establish and build relationships with consumers, identifying influential factors such as the personalities, motives, and communication styles of both consumers and brands (for a review, see MacInnis, Park, and Priester [2009]). Surprisingly, researchers interested in brand relationships have not yet explored how brands' public communication with other brands affects their relationships with consumers. Of course, researchers have explored how strategic partnerships, such as brand collaborations and alliances, affect brand outcomes (e.g., [38]; [57]). However, these brand interactions occur largely behind the scenes and reflect formal business arrangements as opposed to informal, public communication that makes consumers privy to how a brand treats its competitors. We suggest that consumers will infer important information about a brand based on the way it communicates with other brands. Specifically, we posit that consumers who observe a brand praising its competition will perceive the praiser brand as having positive intentions toward others, known as brand warmth. Subsequently, consumers will develop more positive evaluations of and interest in the praiser brand.</p><a id="AN0157259287-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-3" title="Brand-to-Brand Praise and Warmth Perceptions">Brand-to-Brand Praise and Warmth Perceptions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research has established that people judge others—individuals, groups, cultures, countries—using two fundamental dimensions, often referred to as warmth and competence ([25]; [32]).[<a id="bib5up

Evolutionarily speaking, it allowed our ancestors to quickly distinguish friend from foe and prepare to fight or flee.

Importantly, while the precise contribution of warmth versus competence to different downstream consequences varies (e.g., [37]), brands generally aspire to be strong on both dimensions and occupy the coveted "golden quadrant" ([<a id="bib1up

Prior research has theorized that warmth is established through signals of cooperation (vs. competition) and actions that appear to serve others as opposed to the self (i.e., actions that are "other-profitable"; [16]; [52]). We suggest that offering praise to a competitor provides a strong illustration of such cooperative, "other-profitable" activity. Consumers will therefore perceive a brand that praises competitive brands as warmer (relative to a brand that engages in other types of common brand messaging). This then leads to positive downstream consequences, such as increased purchases.</p><a id="AN0157259287-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-4" title="Costliness as an Antidote to Skepticism">Costliness as an Antidote to Skepticism</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In hypothesizing the positive effect of brand-to-brand praise on warmth, it is important to note that high warmth is more difficult to establish and maintain than high competence, as people are often skeptical of others' motives. That is, warm behavior is often discounted, considered to be driven by ulterior motives and easier to fake than competence ([18]; [56]). Such skepticism has also been identified as an issue in research on praise more specifically. For example, in many brand-to-consumer exchanges, such as salesclerk-to-consumer interactions, praise generates suspicion from the consumer; consumers often suspect ulterior motives behind a salesclerk's compliment and perceive the salesclerk to be insincere when the praise occurs before a purchase ([11]; [44]). Further, observers who witness praise happening among others tend to be more skeptical of the praiser and do not react as positively as recipients of the praise ([13]; [29]; [60]). This then leads to the question: When and why might brand-to-brand praise surmount the skepticism associated with praise and other displays of warmth?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We suggest that brand-to-brand praise operates uniquely from the aforementioned person-to-person and brand-to-consumer displays of warmth, particularly when the praise is directed toward competitors, due to its costliness. Consumers assume that complimenting a competitor is a costly action that does not directly benefit the complimenting brand. Research across disciplines suggests that the costliness of an act is the key component of whether the act is perceived as a meaningful signal of an underlying trait rather than an uninformative act motivated by devious or ulterior motives, also known as "cheap talk" (e.g., [59]; [67]). A common example from the natural world is the male peacock's tail. The costliness of this large and colorful tail, such as how it can handicap the bird's ability to escape from predators, is what makes it a credible signal of fitness to potential mates. Only those who truly possess the focal underlying trait would or could incur such costs. Linking this principle to the present context, only brands that are truly warm would incur the real or potential costs of praising the competition. Consumers should therefore not be as suspicious of brands that praise competitors as compared with brands that engage in less costly messaging. This costliness is why brand-to-brand praise, when directed toward competitors, is a strong signal of warmth, differentiating it from other common types of praise (e.g., salesclerk-to-consumer), surmounting consumer skepticism, and driving its positive influence on consumer attitudes and reactions.</p><a id="AN0157259287-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-5" title="Effect on Competence Perceptions">Effect on Competence Perceptions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although the focus thus far has been on perceptions of warmth, one might wonder whether brands sacrifice competence when enhancing perceptions of warmth via brand-to-brand praise. This is a reasonable concern, as prior research suggests that in comparative contexts, for people and brands alike, when warmth (competence) is relatively high for a given entity, perceptions of that entity's competence (warmth) suffer (e.g., [<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref51" title="2">2</a>]; [28]; [36]; [54]). We suggest that praising a competitor offers brands unique advantages that allow them to maintain perceptions of competence in the face of increasing warmth. In particular, we suggest that consumers hold a lay intuition that a brand that is willing to praise its competitors must be fairly confident in its own abilities, which then allows consumers to maintain, if not increase, positive perceptions of its competence. This is reminiscent of the lay belief—confirmed by academic research—that people who are secure in their identity are the most willing to be kind and compliment others (e.g., [<a id="bib9up

Still, while competence may play a role in driving the effects of brand-to-brand praise, we do not expect it to be the primary driver of increased interest in the praiser brand, as perceptions of competence should be most strongly driven by cues of status versus the cues of cooperation that are focal in brand-to-brand praise ([24]).</p><a id="AN0157259287-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-6" title="Summary of the Current Research">Summary of the Current Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, we argue that brand-to-brand praise often promotes positive brand evaluations and choice of the praiser.

We introduce an important moderator to illustrate this point: individual differences in consumers' skepticism toward brand messaging. We predict that the effect of brand-to-brand communication will be strongest among individuals who are highly skeptical of brands. This is because the costliness associated with praising a competitor minimizes the extent to which persuasion knowledge concerns are activated among this group of consumers as compared with more traditional brand communication (H<sub>5</sub>).

Next, we show that this effect is specific to praise that is aimed toward a brand's competitor and thus deemed costly (Study 3; H<sub>3</sub>). We then explore warmth as the key mechanism, demonstrating that it mediates the effect of brand-to-brand praise (Study 4; H<sub>2</sub>) and that the effect is strongest for for-profit brands that have greater need to enhance perceptions of warmth (Study 5; H<sub>4</sub>). Finally, we demonstrate that brand-to-brand praise has the largest effect on individuals with high levels of skepticism toward traditional brand communication (Study 6; H<sub>5</sub>). Throughout these studies, we also test for alternative explanations, including that praise confers benefits due to novelty or authenticity, or that the effect is driven by negative reactions to self-promotion (i.e., bragging) rather than positive reactions to praise. Finally, we also examine the role of competence in several studies (Studies 4, 5, and 6). Evidence suggests that, while perceptions of brand warmth are the primary mechanism underlying this effect, brand-to-brand praise does not harm and can even boost perceptions of competence, which can influence desired outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Together, these studies provide insight into when and why brand-to-brand praise is beneficial for brands.

In addition, in Study 1a, we utilize another type of control message in the form of an endorsement from another organization in the industry to show that praising a competitor enhances evaluations more than receiving an endorsement from others. Further, the endorsement condition serves as a separate point of comparison, ensuring that the hypothesized difference between the brand-to-brand praise condition and the self-promotion condition can be interpreted as a boost from brand-to-brand praise and not merely a negative reaction to self-promotion.</p><a id="AN0157259287-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-13" title="Study 1a: Facebook Advertisement Click-Through Rate">Study 1a: Facebook Advertisement Click-Through Rate</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259287-14"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-14" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><em>Participants and design.</em> This preregistered study utilized a three-cell between-subjects design: Facebook users saw an advertisement on Facebook featuring self-promotion, an external endorsement, or brand-to-brand praise.[<a id="bib6up

We created a fictitious car wash brand called Precision Car Wash and launched three advertisements for the brand on Facebook. The self-promotion message stated, "Precision Car Wash is proud to receive the Industry Best 2020 Award." The external endorsement consisted of a message from a fictitious organization, The Industry Best 2020 Award Committee, announcing Precision Car Wash as the year's award recipient. Finally, the brand-to-brand praise ad consisted of a message from Precision Car Wash congratulating another fictitious car wash business, LikeNew Car Wash, on winning the Industry Best 2020 Award (for study stimuli, see Web Appendix B). Facebook users who saw the ad could click on the message to be taken to the Facebook page of Precision Car Wash for more information. We measured the number of impressions and clicks, which allowed us to compare click-through rates (clicks as a percent of impressions; CTRs), for each ad. We ran the ads over the course of five days and used Facebook's recommended advertising algorithm to reach 80% power in testing the ads for a final sample of 13,719 impressions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also conducted two separate supplemental tests of these stimuli.

We expect that when a brand compliments a relevant direct competitor, which we define as a brand that competes in the same category as the focal brand, consumers view that compliment as relatively costly or risky because a brand has more to lose when bringing positive attention to such competition. It is such costliness that credibly signals that the brand must truly have warm intentions. We do not expect our effects to hold when a brand compliments an irrelevant noncompetitor, which we define as a brand that does not compete in the same category as the focal brand. In this scenario, the brand incurs lower cost by bringing attention to the irrelevant noncompetitor because there are less obvious repercussions, and thus the compliment is a less credible signal of a brand's warmth. This study also aims to demonstrate that the effects of brand-to-brand praise are not driven solely by the perceived novelty of the message or by negative reactions to self-promotional messages.</p><a id="AN0157259287-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-28" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259287-29"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-29" title="Participants and design">Participants and design</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Three hundred ninety-nine participants (50.4% female) recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk took part in this four-cell between-subjects design (helpful control, self-promotion, costly praise, noncostly praise).</p><a id="AN0157259287-30"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-30" title="Procedure">Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We created two eyeglasses brands for this study, Franklin's Frames and Lazlo's Lenses, and introduced them to participants as competitors.

Furthermore, we find that noncostly praise (i.e., praise toward irrelevant noncompetitors) did not give the same boost. This result suggests that simply speaking positively about another brand is not enough; the consumer must view the compliment as costly to the brand for it to have positive effects. Although we find costliness to be necessary to show the benefits of praise, it is not the underlying driver of the effects (mediation comparing the self-promotion and costly praise conditions: ab = .06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [−.045,.191]; PROCESS Model 4, 5,000 bootstrap samples; [31]). This study also begins to cast doubt on novelty as a primary driver of the effect, given that the noncostly praise was perceived to be as novel (but not evaluated as positively) as the costly praise. We further test the role of novelty in subsequent studies. In addition, we again find that the effects on brand attitude do not occur because consumers dislike self-promotion messages but are instead driven by the boost from seeing the costly praise message, replicating the findings of Studies 1a and 2.</p><a id="AN0157259287-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-36" title="Study 4: Testing Warmth as the Mechanism">Study 4: Testing Warmth as the Mechanism</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To begin to understand why brand-to-brand praise increases brand evaluations and choice, we conducted a qualitative pretest gauging people's natural reactions (i.e., inferences, attributions) to observing a brand complimenting a competitor. Participants (N = 150) on Prolific saw a tweet from PlayStation congratulating Nintendo on its Nintendo Switch launch and then listed five adjectives to describe PlayStation. We find that observers more frequently attribute warmth-related words (e.g., friendly, supportive, kind; 55.73% of the adjectives), rather than competence-related words (e.g., confident, successful, intelligent; 17.07% of the adjectives), or any other kind of perception, to the brand, implicating warmth as the most top-of-mind inference following brand-to-brand praise. For additional insight, we asked participants to take the perspective of a manager and indicate why they would or would not post a message praising the competition. We find that most participants would be willing to praise a competitor (69.33%). Again, the majority of the responses (61.5%) indicated warmth to be the primary reason for the action (e.g., "I want to show others that I act in selfless ways"). Moreover, some responses also positively noted competence-related reasons (e.g., "have confidence in my own brand and its qualities"; "we appear to be positive and not insecure about our place in the market") either exclusively or in combination with warmth (25%), suggesting that while warmth-related reasons are more top-of-mind, perceptions of competence are unlikely to be harmed (for pretest details, see Web Appendix I).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In light of these initial qualitative insights, we empirically test warmth as the driver of the benefits of brand-to-brand praise and compare it with competence in Study 4. We predict that brand-to-brand praise enhances perceptions of brand warmth, which predominantly drives the boost in brand evaluations, rather than competence. Ultimately, we expect the heightened brand evaluations to drive consumer action, which is measured in this study as their willingness to sacrifice their own time (for free) on behalf of the brand.</p><a id="AN0157259287-37"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-37" title="Methods">Methods</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259287-38"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-38" title="Participants and design">Participants and design</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two hundred participants (57% female) from Prolific took part in this two-cell between-subjects study (control, praise).</p><a id="AN0157259287-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-39" title="Procedure">Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants were introduced to a real tea brand, Treecup Tea, from Kickstarter.

Individuals who are more skeptical are generally less persuaded by marketing messages and are less trusting of brands. As brands are confronting an "age of cynicism" where skepticism is at an all-time high ([21]; [49]) and 71% of consumers report having little faith in brands ([30]), it is very important to understand its effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As seen in the previous study, the effects of brand-to-brand praise become more prominent when there is room for increasing perceptions of brand warmth. Consumers who are more skeptical of advertising distrust that brands have positive intentions, or warmth, and thus inherently provide brands with greater room to improve in warmth than their nonskeptical counterparts who are already trusting. Thus, brand-to-brand communication may be most effective among skeptics, as it can bypass their cynicism and boost perceptions of warmth. Moreover, such skeptics are generally more persuaded by nonadvertising sources of information and emotional appeals ([48]), which allow marketers to circumvent consumer resistance by decreasing the activation of persuasion knowledge ([27]). Because brand-to-brand praise does not explicitly aim to promote one's brand and instead relies on the more emotional signal that the brand is high in warmth, it is less likely to activate persuasion knowledge and more likely to be accepted. Thus, we predict that consumers high in skepticism will be the most affected by brand-to-brand praise. Study 6 tests this idea utilizing two well-known competitors, Lyft and Uber.</p><a id="AN0157259287-58"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-58" title="Method">Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259287-59"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-59" title="Participants and design">Participants and design</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Six hundred participants were recruited from Prolific for this 2 (message: self-promotion, praise) × measured (advertising skepticism) preregistered study.[18]</p><a id="AN0157259287-60"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-60" title="Procedure">Procedure</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Participants first completed the skepticism toward advertising scale ([47]; 1 = "strongly disagree," and 5 = "strongly agree") and then completed filler items.

Across a variety of different modes of communication (social media, print advertising, digital advertising), study methods (web scraping; field, lab, and online studies), contexts (consumer products and services), outcomes (brand attitudes, social media and advertising engagement, brand choice, purchase behavior), and praise content, we show that consumers who witness brand-to-brand praise between competitors form more favorable evaluations of the praiser brand than consumers who witness other forms of communication, including typical self-promotion messages, helpful messages, basic brand information, and even outside-industry praise (for a summary of contexts, conditions, and findings across studies, see Web Appendix N). In addition to showing robustness to a variety of praise messages in the presented studies, a preregistered supplemental study demonstrates that the effect is further robust to both general and specific praise (Web Appendix O). Furthermore, the varied study stimuli suggest that this effect is robust to brands in a wide range of industries—including car care, snacks, candy, eyewear, beverages, technology, and transportation—with competitive relationships varying in intensity. In other words, brand-to-brand praise seems to benefit the praiser in less competitively intense relationships (e.g., mom-and-pop popcorn brands) as well as more competitively intense relationships (e.g., PlayStation and Nintendo, Uber and Lyft) in a variety of industries. We trace this effect primarily to the notion that brand-to-brand praise signals a brand's warmth, which leads to improved brand evaluations and affects consumer choices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, we show that this effect only exists when the praise is deemed to be associated with significant cost or risk (Study 3). Importantly, we find that the effects of brand-to-brand praise are diminished in some situations or among some consumers, such as when the brand is already high in warmth (Study 5) or among consumers who are already trusting of brand intent (Study 6). These boundaries provide further evidence for the crucial role that perceptions of warmth play in driving the benefits of praise. While other mechanisms may also play a role, as consumer behaviors are generally multiply determined ([35]; [55]), we find warmth to be the most consistent, primary driver of the effects of brand-to-brand praise.</p><a id="AN0157259287-66"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-66" title="Theoretical Contributions">Theoretical Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research makes several theoretical contributions to literature streams on brand perceptions and relationships, brand communication, and praise.

We demonstrate that observing brand-to-brand praise can positively affect perceptions of a brand's warmth and influence subsequent brand evaluations. Second, we add to the warmth and competence literature by introducing a novel context in which brand-to-brand praise increases warmth without harming perceptions of competence. Third, our research demonstrates that directing positive attention toward the competition instead of toward one's own brand brings about benefits for the praiser brand, unlike what brands would typically do in comparative advertising and two-sided messaging campaigns (e.g., [<a id="bib4up

Finally, we contribute to the literature on praise by identifying brand-to-brand communication between competitors as a feasible form of praise that is less likely to induce suspicion compared with praise in traditional person-to-person contexts.</p><a id="AN0157259287-67"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-67" title="Marketing Implications and Future Research">Marketing Implications and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As we have noted, our findings may be surprising to practitioners who have been regularly and reasonably advised to avoid bringing positive attention to their competitors. However, our studies show that in some circumstances, praise is a method of brand-to-brand interaction that can result in beneficial consequences for the praising brand. Managers might consider offering compliments to competitors to boost their own brand evaluations. In other words, brands can expand from solely focusing on brand-to-consumer relationships to also focusing on their brand-to-brand relationships. This is akin to the positive reactions that politicians sometimes receive when positively acknowledging their opponent ([12]). We suggest a new context in which positive acknowledgment can benefit brands. With the rise of the digital age, brands can easily "speak" with each other and be observed by consumers. While it is not uncommon for brands to speak via "feuds" on social media, such as when Wendy's teases McDonald's for using frozen beef ([19]), we show in a supplemental study (Web Appendix P) that positive communication provides unique advantages. Negative or snarky communication, directed at a competitor or even directed at the self (as in the case of two-sided messaging), does not provide the same increase in brand evaluations. Although there will likely be variation depending on the exact content and cleverness of snarky communication (a ripe area for future research), marketers would be wise to consider opportunities for brand-to-brand praise instead, perhaps utilizing social media as a platform, to foster a warmer image.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Brand-to-brand praise may also be a valuable way to respond to competitors' actions. While the norm for companies responding to a competitor's new product release is to avoid saying anything that would bring attention to that competitor, our studies suggest that responding positively can increase purchases for the praiser brand without boosting the competitor to the same degree. Importantly, while prior work has shown that a brand's positioning as an underdog or market leader has important implications ([50]), brand-to-brand praise may be appropriate regardless of the competitor's market status. In a preregistered supplemental study (Web Appendix Q), we find that the favorable effects of brand-to-brand praise on brand evaluations are robust to the market leadership status of the brand. Future research could further explore how characteristics about the firm such as market leadership or firm size may factor into the effect of brand-to-brand praise.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, while the variety of brands leveraged in our studies suggest that brand-to-brand praise is likely beneficial when directed toward both less intense (e.g., local popcorn brands) and more intense (e.g., PlayStation and Nintendo, Uber and Lyft) competitors, future research should more systematically explore the role of competitive intensity. Such research might explore brand-to-brand praise with indirect versus direct competitors, which would likely vary in levels of perceived costliness. Indirect competitors may include other brands that are in a similar industry but do not compete directly in the same product category, such as in the case of soda and water in the drinks industry. In Study 3, we find that praise toward a direct competitor is deemed to be costly and results in better brand evaluations compared with praise toward noncompetitors. However, would praise toward an indirect competitor be perceived to be costly enough to increase evaluations? Outside of direct competition, what else determines whether praise is deemed to be costly or not? How would consumers react if complementary brands, such as soda and popcorn brands, praised each other? While we suggest that praise should benefit the praiser as long as it is perceived as costly, understanding what kind of brand-to-brand praise is considered costly may be beneficial to marketers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, future research could also explore how brand-to-brand praise compares to other types of messages that convey warmth. For example, brands often communicate prosocial messages, such as a food brand showing active support for a local food bank. Brands might also post self-deprecating messages that recognize their own room for improvement. While these types of messages may signal warmth, they may not benefit the messenger brand in the same way as brand-to-brand praise does because of the unique aspect of costliness associated with praising a direct competitor. Future research could compare these various types of brand messaging to find ones that benefit brands the most.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future work might also examine whether certain brand personalities benefit more from praise than others. Our for-profit versus nonprofit results in Study 5 hint that brands with personalities that are inherently associated with warmth (e.g., sincere brands) may benefit less. Relatedly, are there circumstances under which snarky interactions or backhanded compliments are better suited for some brands, such as Wendy's ([15])? We noted that negativity did not fare as well as positivity (Web Appendix P), but under what conditions might this be different? Cultural differences, such as collectivism and individualism, may also play an important role. Collectivists, known for valuing community and kinship, may be particularly likely to value the warmth associated with brand-to-brand praise ([<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3_ref141" title="3">3</a>]). Furthermore, future work could also explore when the effects of brand-to-brand praise are affected by gender. While women may value warmth more in some circumstances ([66]), we do not find consistent moderation by gender in our studies (Web Appendix R), which is consistent with prior work showing that gender does not always moderate brand warmth perceptions ([<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref143" title="5">5</a>]). Further research is needed to better understand the possible role that factors such as brand personality, consumer culture, and gender play in affecting brand-to-brand praise responses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another direction for future research involves investigating the optimal frequency of brand-to-brand praise. Although we demonstrate that some repetition may be acceptable (Study 4), one limitation of this research is the focus on a single instance of praise in a short span of time. Praise when repeated over time may become less effective or even backfire. Excessive praise may trigger suspicion in observers (e.g., [23]), and previous research has shown that suspicious praise can lead to the praiser being perceived as less sincere ([11]; [44]). Thus, future research might explore the optimal levels or repetition of praise and the consequences of excessive praise to prevent such a backfiring effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To further prevent backfiring effects, future research might also explore what happens if the praised competitor leverages the praise "against" the praiser? For instance, what if a praised brand publicly suggests that they are so great that even their competition praises them? It is possible that, if used by the competitor in this manner, the praise could damage the praiser brand. However, it is also possible that this kind of act could be perceived as arrogant or manipulative, damaging the praised brand and eliciting sympathy for the praiser.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, this work raises the question: Are brands missing an opportunity to build positive relationships with consumers by not (publicly) building positive relationships with competitors? We suggest that marketers would be wise to explore the intriguing benefits of brand-to-brand praise.</p><a id="AN0157259287-68"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259287-68" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211053002 - Supplemental material for Befriending the Enemy: The Effects of Observing Brand-to-Brand Praise on Consumer Evaluations and Choices</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211053002 for Befriending the Enemy: The Effects of Observing Brand-to-Brand Praise on Consumer Evaluations and Choices by Lingrui Zhou, Katherine M.

This may be due to Carolina Popcorn Shoppe being shown first across conditions, or because Carolina Popcorn Shoppe had a name that resonated more with the local community. Importantly, however, the focal brand still captured greater preference in the praise condition than the self-promotion condition. This might lead one to question whether underdogs are more likely to benefit from offering competitive praise. We find that market leadership status does not affect reactions to brand praise differentially (see the supplemental study in Web Appendix Q).</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em> See https://aspredicted.org/cb7nq.pdf.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em> In the current study and in all subsequent ANCOVAs, we control for the believability of the message.

While many companies choose to humanize their customer service chatbots (e.g., giving them names and avatars), little is known about how anthropomorphism influences customer responses to chatbots in service settings. Across five studies, including an analysis of a large real-world data set from an international telecommunications company and four experiments, the authors find that when customers enter a chatbot-led service interaction in an angry emotional state, chatbot anthropomorphism has a negative effect on customer satisfaction, overall firm evaluation, and subsequent purchase intentions. However, this is not the case for customers in nonangry emotional states. The authors uncover the underlying mechanism driving this negative effect (expectancy violations caused by inflated pre-encounter expectations of chatbot efficacy) and offer practical implications for managers. These findings suggest that it is important to both carefully design chatbots and consider the emotional context in which they are used, particularly in customer service interactions that involve resolving problems or handling complaints.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: customer service; artificial intelligence; conversational agents; chatbots; anthropomorphism; anger; expectancy violations</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing is on the rise, as managers experiment with the use of AI-driven tools to augment customer experiences. One relatively early use of AI in marketing has been the deployment of digital conversational agents, commonly called chatbots. Chatbots "converse" with customers, through either voice or text, to address a variety of customer needs. Chatbots are increasingly replacing human service agents on websites, social media, and messaging services. In fact, the market for chatbots and related technologies is forecasted to exceed $1.34 billion by 2024 ([71]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While some industry commentators suggest that chatbots will improve customer service while simultaneously reducing costs ([16]), others believe they will undermine customer service and negatively impact firms ([34]). Thus, while customer service chatbots have the potential to deliver greater efficiency for firms, whether—and how—to best design and deploy chatbots remains an open question. The current research begins to address this issue by exploring conditions under which customer service chatbots negatively impact key marketing outcomes. While many factors may influence customers' interactions with chatbots, we focus on the interplay between two common features of the customer service chatbot experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The first feature relates to the design of the chatbot itself: chatbot anthropomorphism. This is the extent to which the chatbot is endowed with humanlike qualities such as a name or avatar. Currently, the prevailing logic in practice is to make chatbots appear more humanlike ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref4" title="9">9</a>]) and for them to mimic the nature of human-to-human conversations ([44]). However, anthropomorphic design in other contexts (e.g., branding, product design) does not always produce beneficial outcomes (e.g., [36]; [38]). Accordingly, we examine circumstances under which anthropomorphism of customer service chatbots may be harmful for firms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second dimension explored in this research is a commonly occurring feature in customer service interactions, irrespective of the modality: customer anger. Anger is one of the most prevalent specific emotions occurring in customer service contexts; estimates suggest that as many as 20% of call center interactions involve hostile, angry, complaining customers ([24]). Furthermore, the prevalence of anger increased during the COVID-19 pandemic ([57]; [60]), so a higher proportion of interactions are likely to be with angry customers. Thus, it is both practically relevant to consider how customer anger interacts with chatbot anthropomorphism and theoretically relevant due to the specific responses (e.g., aggression, holding others accountable) evoked by anger that impact the efficacy of more humanlike technology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across five studies including the analysis of a large real-world data set from an international telecommunications company and four experiments, we find that when customers in an angry emotional state encounter a chatbot-led service interaction, chatbot anthropomorphism has a negative effect on customers' satisfaction with the service encounter, their overall evaluation of the firm, and their subsequent purchase intentions. However, this is not the case for customers in nonangry emotional states. The negative effect is driven by an expectancy violation; specifically, anthropomorphism inflates preinteraction expectations of chatbot efficacy, and those expectations are disconfirmed. Our findings suggest that it is important to both carefully design chatbots and consider the emotional context in which they are used, particularly in common types of customer service interactions that involve handling problems or complaints. This research contributes to the nascent literature on chatbots in customer service and has managerial implications both for how chatbots should be designed and for context-related deployment considerations.</p><a id="AN0154071464-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-2" title="Conceptual Framework">Conceptual Framework</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0154071464-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-3" title="Anthropomorphism in Marketing">Anthropomorphism in Marketing</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Deliberate marketing efforts have made anthropomorphism, or the attribution of humanlike properties, characteristics, or mental states to nonhuman agents and objects ([20]; [68]), especially pervasive in the modern marketplace. Product designers and brand managers often encourage customers to view their products and brands as humanlike, through a product's visual features (e.g., face-like car grilles; [40]) or brand mascots (e.g., the Pillsbury Doughboy; [66]). In digital settings, advances in machine learning and AI have ushered in a new wave of highly anthropomorphic devices, from humanlike self-driving cars ([70]) to voice-activated virtual assistants with human names and speech patterns (e.g., Amazon's Alexa; [32]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Extant research generally suggests that inducing anthropomorphic thought is linked to improved outcomes. "Humanized" products and brands are more likely to achieve long-term business success because they encourage a more personal consumer–brand relationship ([<a id="bib1up

[67] found that anthropomorphized products increased consumers' preference and subsequent choice of those products.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Anthropomorphism of technology has also been shown to improve marketing outcomes. Humanlike interfaces can increase customer trust in technology by increasing perceived competence ([<a id="bib5up

Avatars (anthropomorphic virtual characters) can make online shopping experiences more enjoyable, and both avatars and anthropomorphic chatbots can increase purchase intentions ([27]; [31]; [72]). Anthropomorphic digital messengers can even be more persuasive than human spokespeople in some contexts ([63]) and can increase advertising effectiveness ([13]). Anthropomorphized digital devices can even become friends with their users ([56]), such that the consumer resists being disloyal by replacing the product ([12]), leading to greater customer brand loyalty.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although most evidence points to beneficial effects of anthropomorphism, there are drawbacks. For example, anthropomorphic helpers in video games reduce enjoyment of the gaming experience by undermining a players' sense of autonomy ([36]). Other research shows that for agency-oriented customers, brand anthropomorphism exaggerates the perceived unfairness of price increases ([38]) and hurts brand performance amid negative publicity ([54]). Low-power customers perceive risk-bearing entities (e.g., slot machines) as riskier when the entities are anthropomorphized ([37]). Further, research suggests that when customers are in crowded environments and want to socially withdraw, brand anthropomorphism harms customer responses ([53]). Thus, it would be overly simplistic to assume that anthropomorphism positively impacts customers' encounters with brands, products, or companies. The consequences are more nuanced, with outcomes depending on both customer characteristics and the context ([64]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While customers' downstream responses to anthropomorphism are mixed, one consistent consequence of anthropomorphism is that customers attribute more agency to anthropomorphic entities ([20]). "Agency" refers to the capacity to plan and act ([25]). Because anthropomorphism leads customers to perceive a mental state in another entity, it increases individuals' perception that the entity is capable of acting in a deliberate manner ([69]). This increases expectations that the agent has abilities such as emotion recognition, planning, and communication ([25]). These heightened expectations lead individuals to ascribe moral responsibilities to anthropomorphic entities ([69]), to believe that the entity should be held accountable for its actions ([18]), and to think the entity deserves punishment in the case of wrongdoing ([25]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Of course, anthropomorphic entities do not always perform in a manner consistent with the high levels of agency customers expect. In fact, some researchers suggest that one reason behind the "uncanny valley" (i.e., the tendency for a robot to elicit negative emotional reactions when it closely resembles a human; [48]) is because robots do not perform in the agentic manner that their human resemblance would imply ([69]). In other words, the robots' behavior violates the expectations elicited by their highly anthropomorphic facade. These violations arguably apply to current chatbots, given that their performance is not expected to reach believable levels of human intelligence before 2029 ([58]). Thus, expectancy violations play an important role in chatbot-driven customer service settings.</p><a id="AN0154071464-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-4" title="Expectancy Violations and Customer Anger">Expectancy Violations and Customer Anger</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Before using a product or service, customers form expectations regarding how they anticipate the target product, brand, or company will perform.

Expectancy violations not only harm customer satisfaction ([50]; [51]) but also negatively impact other consequential downstream outcomes, including attitude toward the company ([10]) and purchase intentions ([11]; [50]).

Anger is often used as a strategy to respond to obstacles ([43]; [46]) or retaliate against an offending party ([14]) because of its tendency to increase action and aggression, compared with other emotions that are deactivating (e.g., sadness; [15]; [41]) or nonaggressive ([43]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This retaliation is also predicted by appraisal theorists, who suggest that even in situations of incidental anger, anger increases the tendency to hold others responsible for negative outcomes ([35]) and to respond punitively toward them ([23]; [42]; [43]). This is markedly distinct from emotions such as frustration or regret, which are more likely to manifest when people hold the situation or themselves responsible for negative outcomes, respectively ([21]; [55]). Thus, angry (vs. nonangry) customers are more likely to blame others and retaliate when another's performance falls short of expectations. This is particularly the case if their goals are obstructed ([46]), as angry customers especially feel the need to achieve a desirable outcome ([55]).</p><a id="AN0154071464-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-5" title="Linking Chatbot Anthropomorphism, Expectancy Violation, and Customer Anger">Linking Chatbot Anthropomorphism, Expectancy Violation, and Customer Anger</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Drawing from the extant theories and research, we hypothesize that anthropomorphism heightens customers' preperformance expectations about a chatbot's level of agency and performance capabilities, resulting in expectancy violations.

If a customer treats a chatbot in a more human-consistent way, then we assume that is a consequence of a customer having more anthropomorphic thoughts resulting from perceiving the chatbot as more anthropomorphic. Specifically, we operationalized anthropomorphic treatment as the extent to which customers used the chatbot's name in their text-based conversation. As a name makes an object more anthropomorphic ([68]), the use of the chatbot's name indicates treating it as more human and serves as a reasonable proxy for anthropomorphic treatment.</p><a id="AN0154071464-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-7" title="Data and Measures">Data and Measures</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Data were provided by a major international mobile telecommunications company.

Vitally, we econometrically handled the obvious potential for a selection bias because only 7.5% of all customer chat sessions in our data set included a satisfaction rating. Thus, our analysis is based on the 34,639 chat sessions for which we had a satisfaction measure, but we make use of all 461,689 chat sessions in our treatment of endogenous sample selection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To account for the ordinal nature of our data and the sample selection, we used an extended ordinal probit model, which estimates the probit selection and the ordinal satisfaction ratings equations simultaneously and with correlated errors ([26]).[<a id="bib5up

However, their interaction was significant and negative (β<sub>3</sub> = −.167, <em>p</em> = .05). This was after controlling for the technical performance of the bot during that session (recognition rate mean and variance) and the number of customer interactions in a session.

Thus, it appears that the mere presence of anger can result in a negative relationship between anthropomorphic treatment and satisfaction.

An increase in the average level of anger exhibited by the consumer during their session resulted in a lower level of satisfaction with the service encounter, but only when the chatbot was treated anthropomorphically. In situations where the bot was not treated anthropomorphically, higher levels of anger did not meaningfully affect consumer satisfaction. Of course, this study has limitations. First, all customers were presented with the same highly anthropomorphic chatbot, so we had to rely on the variance in customers' anthropomorphic treatment of the bot, as opposed to variation in chatbot anthropomorphism, per se. Second, we initially assumed that customers entered the chat angry, independent from their exchange with the chatbot; however, our robustness checks confirm that anger is not strictly exogenous but also arose out of characteristics of the exchange with the bot (e.g., the number of exchanges, variance in language recognition). Finally, both anthropomorphic treatment and anger were measured from customer behaviors, rather than manipulated.

In addition, careful chatbot selection enabled us to rule out idiosyncratic features of the Study 1 chatbot. Specifically, two of its specific features pose potential confounds in trying to generalize the results. First, it was clearly female, and previous research suggests that female service employees are more often targets of expressed frustration and anger from customers than are male service employees ([59]). In addition, she had a smiling expression, which is incongruent with the emotional state of participants who were angry, and such affective incongruity may cause a negative reaction and lower satisfaction.</p><a id="AN0154071464-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-18" title="Pretests">Pretests</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0154071464-19"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-19" title="Avatar">Avatar</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We pretested avatars to select one that was both gender and affectively neutral.

In addition to serving as an initial chatbot interaction, this question also functioned as an attention check, allowing us to filter out any participants who entered nonsensical (e.g., "GOOD") or non-English answers ([17]). Subsequently, participants encountered a series of inquiries and corresponding drop-down menus regarding the specific product they were inquiring about (camera) and issue they were having (broken and/or damaged lens). They were then given return instructions and indicated they needed more help. Using free response, they described their second issue and answered follow-up questions from the chatbot about the specific delivery issue (delivery time is too long) and reason for needing faster delivery (product will not come in time for a special event). Finally, participants were told that a service representative would contact them to discuss the issue further.

Thus, we remove the visual trait of anthropomorphism (i.e., the avatar) and anticipate the negative effect of anger to attenuate, providing further support that the degree of humanlikeness is responsible for driving the effect. Second, we wanted to test H<sub>1b</sub> by exploring whether the negative effect of anthropomorphism for angry customers would extend to influence their evaluations of the company itself. Finally, we wanted to provide initial evidence that expectancy violations are responsible for these observed negative effects. To do so, we examined whether the outcome of the chat interaction—namely, if the chatbot was able to indubitably resolve the customer's concerns—could serve as a boundary condition.

Customers are increasingly interacting with firms through chatbots, and there has been a significant push for more humanlike versions of such bots. Prior research has begun to demonstrate some negative implications of anthropomorphism in specific situations, including video games ([36]), gambling ([37]), and overcrowded environments ([53]), as well as for some types of people (agency-oriented customers; [38]). Yet, our research is the first to demonstrate the negative effect of anthropomorphism in the wider context of customer service and connect the use of these humanlike chatbots to negative firm outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We find, using a large data set of real-world customer interactions and four experiments, that anthropomorphic chatbots can harm firms. An angry customer encountering an anthropomorphic (s. nonanthropomorphic) chatbot is more likely to report lower customer satisfaction, lower overall evaluation of the firm, and lower future purchase intentions. This negative effect is driven by expectancy violations due to inflated preinteraction expectations of efficacy caused by the anthropomorphic chatbot. Angry customers respond more punitively to these expectancy violations compared with nonangry customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The decision to anthropomorphize a chatbot is a deliberate and strategic choice made by the firm. The current research shows that this choice has a significant impact on key marketing outcomes for a substantial (and increasing due to the pandemic; [57]; [60]) group of customers: specifically, those who are angry during the service encounter. As such, firms should attempt to gauge whether a customer is angry either before or early in the conversation (e.g., using NLP) and deploy a chatbot with an appropriate level of anthropomorphism or lack thereof. A less precise solution would be to assign nonanthropomorphic chatbots to customer service roles that tend to involve angry customers (e.g., customer complaint centers) while continuing to employ anthropomorphic agents in more neutral or promotion-oriented settings (e.g., searches for product information) due to their previously documented beneficial effects ([27]; [72]) and the current empirical evidence (i.e., Study 1, Web Appendix I). This strategic deployment of chatbots should help firms deliver better chatbot-mediated service experiences. Moreover, appropriate chatbot deployment can improve immediate customer satisfaction, company evaluations, and future purchase intentions (e.g., customer retention).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given our finding that the negative effect of anthropomorphism for angry customers is driven by an expectancy violation due to inflated preinteraction efficacy expectations, another practical implication is that marketers should consider how to frame their customer service chatbots to customers. As our final study shows, if an anthropomorphic chatbot is deployed to angry customers, it is best to downplay its capabilities. Some companies seem to have intuited this, as illustrated by the aforementioned Slack bot example. Similarly, the Poncho weather app told people, "I'm good at talking about the weather. Other stuff, not so good" ([65]). Explicitly informing customers that they are conversing with an imperfect chatbot lowers preinteraction efficacy expectations that were inflated by anthropomorphic traits. Yet, this is not obvious to all companies; there are plenty of examples of chatbots that inadvertently increase preinteraction efficacy expectations. For example, Madi, Madison Reed's chatbot, is labeled a "genius" ([49]) and Tinka, T-Mobile's chatbot, is given a 18,456 IQ ([47]). Of course, Study 3 shows that meeting the high expectations for service can also reduce the negative impact of anthropomorphism. Thus, by utilizing these strategies, all customers can be handled well via AI technology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Alternatively, firms could transfer angry customers directly to a real live person to assist them, thus avoiding an anthropomorphic chatbot–based expectancy violation entirely. Yet this option incurs additional costs and assumes that the human agent has greater agency and efficacy. While it is plausible that human agents will deliver higher quality service, in actuality, human agents suffer from constraints that limit their effectiveness. Thus, future research might address how people respond to chatbots compared with humans. It would be interesting to explore whether higher expectations of quality and agency would be compensated for by social norms of polite interactions and compassion for others.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, anger may not be the only relevant emotion to consider managerially or theoretically. While our data indicate that anger is of primary importance and is the most commonly identified emotion in service contexts, it is possible that with more sophisticated language processing tools, other emotions, different sources of those emotions, and social conventions could become relevant. For example, it could be that anger remains relevant in customer service contexts but that the source of the anger, such as whether it arises from a lack of procedural or interactional fairness, also impacts the success of anthropomorphic bots ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref166" title="7">7</a>]). Thus, it is important for future research to continue to investigate how the complexities of emotion, sources of emotion, and social norms interact to influence the effectiveness of anthropomorphic digital customer service agents.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is worth noting that there might be a point in the future when the conversational performance of AI becomes sufficiently advanced and its implementation so commonplace that expectancy violations simply cease to be a concern. In this future, chatbots might be capable of greater freedom of action, in addition to performing intuitive and empathetic tasks ([33]). In approaching such a point, the difference between the reactions of angry and nonangry customers would likely diminish until the groups are nondistinct, and anthropomorphism might cease to conditionally influence customer outcomes. However, this future does not appear to be imminent ([58]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the short and medium term, therefore, as firms experiment with conversational agents in a variety of customer-facing roles, it remains important to consider the anthropomorphic traits of the chatbot, including simple features such as naming (i.e., "Alexa"), language style, and the degree of embodiment, along with the specific customer contexts in which the interactions are likely to occur. Specific contexts can vary from traditional corporations to government (e.g., the Australian government chatbot), law (e.g., the "DoNotPay" chatbot), and psychotherapy (e.g., the "Woebot" chatbot). It is worthwhile to decide, and important for future research to explore, which chatbot is most appropriate for any given interaction, according to the chatbot's characteristics and the specific context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Altogether, chatbots deliver a multitude of benefits to the business (e.g., scalability, cost reductions, control over the quality of interactions, additional customer data). As such, they will continue to be a valuable tool for marketers as the technology matures. Here, we have shown that the unconditional deployment of humanized chatbots leads to negative marketing outcomes, from dissatisfaction to lowered purchase intentions. However, with careful and conscientious implementation, considering the customer's emotional state (e.g., anger), firms can reap the benefit of this burgeoning technology.</p><a id="AN0154071464-46"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0154071464-46" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211045687 - Supplemental material for Blame the Bot: Anthropomorphism and Anger in Customer–Chatbot Interactions</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211045687 for Blame the Bot: Anthropomorphism and Anger in Customer–Chatbot Interactions by Cammy Crolic, Felipe Thomaz, Rhonda Hadi and Andrew T.

However, each technique carries its own requirements, advantages, and disadvantages. State-of-the-art NLP for emotion detection would involve a combination of a contextualized word representation model, (e.g., Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]), which excels in language comprehension, followed by a classifier neural network. However, this approach requires a preclassified data set to train the model. Unfortunately, a training data set with our target label does not exist, and its absence motivated the need for LIWC's classification in the first place. See the alternative NLP techniques section in Web Appendix A for a more detailed discussion as well as a documentation of our attempts to apply the BERT technique to anger classification.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  Alternatively, a Heckman two-step sample selection correction approach could be used, where the inverse Mills ratio from the first-stage probit selection model is entered as a covariate in a second-stage response regression.

Against this backdrop, the authors consider the possibility that the addition of same brand outlets can, in fact, also create positive effects via customer utility and ultimately benefit franchisees, due to a range of mechanisms such as quality signaling, learning, or brand awareness, resulting in a positive pathway on franchisee performance. The authors unpack this possibility using an experiment and detailed proprietary and publicly available data sets from the hotel industry over a five-year period. Their results show evidence of positive effects on customer utility for same-brand outlets and stronger effects for newer brands, cross brands, and online travel agency channel bookings. Counterfactual simulations indicate that although encroachment hurts franchisees on average, it can modestly benefit same-brand franchisees in low-brand-density markets. Together, the findings illustrate the potential "sunny side" of encroachment, underscoring the need to update our view of encroachment as context-dependent. The novel emphasis on customers versus the dominant firm view suggests customer and incumbent responses to encroachment should be accounted for in the development of franchise strategy and public policy decisions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: brand management; demand estimation; franchise encroachment; franchise sales; franchise systems; structural model</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Franchise encroachment ("encroachment" hereinafter) is a key phenomenon in franchise management. Encroachment occurs when a franchisor places a new outlet in proximity to an existing franchisee(s). Incumbent franchisees view these actions negatively, as the new outlet increases competition and cannibalizes their revenues. This view is reflected in substantial literature in marketing, which primarily focuses on documenting this negative impact ([21]; [33]) and managing the resulting conflict ([23]). The literature also examines ways to safeguard franchisee interests through litigation ([<a id="bib4up

In broad strokes, this literature has painted a picture of encroachment as being predominantly negative for incumbent franchisees and has focused on firm roles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We explore the possibility that encroachment might in fact be positive for incumbent franchisees by incorporating both a customer view and brand differences into this picture. Specifically, we introduce the possibility that customers may gain utility from more outlets of the same brand, subsequently increasing demand and, ultimately, franchisee performance. This utility might come about via a range of mechanisms such as quality signaling, learning, or brand awareness. While researchers have acknowledged conceptually that encroachment may improve franchisee performance ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref7" title="8">8</a>]; [21]), little empirical evidence exists to date. The closest finding is limited: [13] show that multiple exposures of a trademark hotel brand name on a third-party intermediary's website generated an overall net increase in consumer clicks. However, no studies thus far have provided evidence of encroachment activities directly improving performance via customer utility and demand.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While research has examined encroachment effects on customer demand in a static setting with endogenous franchisee pricing ([35]; [39]), these studies do not make the distinction between same versus different brand effects on customer utility, and they focus on a single franchise brand. In contrast, we consider a range of brand characteristics within a franchise chain to inform a broader view of encroachment, performance outcomes, and a more explicit incorporation of the customer's viewpoint. For example, an entry of a Residence Inn hotel will have same brand effects on other Residence Inn hotels and different brand effects on Westin hotels, Element hotels, and so on in the market. We examine these differing effects of brand encroachment on consumer choices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our context is a single franchisor, incumbent franchisee(s) of multiple brands, and a range of encroachment types across various markets. We model the net impact using publicly available data, a proprietary data set from one of the largest hotel groups in the United States over a five-year period, and an experiment. We find that encroachment effects are not only statistically significant but also economically relevant. Although the effects are predominantly negative, we nevertheless find positive effects on customer utility that are stronger for same brands, newer brands, cross brand locations (i.e., brands with overlapping monikers such as Hyatt Place and Hyatt House), and bookings made through online travel agencies such as Expedia and Kayak.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Counterfactual simulations reveal both positive and negative economic outcomes. Overall, encroachment reduces incumbent revenues and profits by 5.3% ($43,810 in revenue and $26,090 in profit per month), consistent with the historical bent of the literature (i.e., increased competition). However, this impact is not statistically significant for same-brand franchisees, suggesting the negative impact is reduced. Further analysis reveals significant positive effects in low-brand-density markets: same-brand franchisees improve performance by approximately 2% per month (i.e., $4,300 in revenue and $2,900 in profit), with 70% (30%) of these outlets realizing higher (lower) revenues as a result.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to directly model encroachment effects on customer preference and identify the conditions under which it might benefit franchisees. We find that while encroachment hurts franchisees on average, the prevailing assumption that it always results in revenue losses for all incumbent franchisees is inaccurate; we find a distinct difference in its impact on same versus different brand outlets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The stakes for better understanding franchising phenomena are substantial. Franchising is one of the most pervasive organizational forms in the U.S. economy, accounting for as much as $890 billion, or 50% of all retail sales across 75 industries.

The fixed fee averages 8% of all payments from franchisees ([28]), leaving 90% of the franchisor's income from royalties. Given that franchisors cannot extract all rents via a fixed fee (see [24]), they have an incentive to add more outlets as long as revenues are positive, but this creates a downward pressure on franchisee profits.

The academic literature mainly focuses on the trade-offs between increased franchisee competition and firm-side benefits such as preemption and firm size spillovers related to entry of hamburger chains ([10]; [17]) or new entrant sales at the expense of incumbents ([20], [21]; [30]). In contrast, practitioners predominantly talk about "demand generators," or businesses that bring in out-of-town visitors, which seem to be less studied. Our analyses corroborate this and show the number of businesses as a strong predictor of hotel entry (Web Appendix W1). However, we find that local population characteristics are less relevant in predicting hotel entry after controlling for the number of businesses.</p><a id="AN0155817135-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-5" title="Encroachment Impact">Encroachment Impact</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Encroachment can have positive and negative effects on incumbents.

This prediction is easily extended to a franchising context: the entry of additional franchisees will lead to greater revenue losses for incumbent franchisees.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ample evidence supports the resulting negative pathway from competition. For example, [21] finds that encroachment leads to significant decreases in hotel franchisee revenues per room ($51–$66.81 per quarter). [18] show that a hotel in Manhattan was less likely to survive as the number of chain units in the area increased. [33] shows the presence of competing convenience stores in the same market, regardless of their chain affiliation, reduces store-level revenues significantly. In fast food franchise settings, evidence for negative pathways approximates on average an 18 percentage point decrease in revenues ([45]). [35] show that incumbents' revenues are decreased by 1%–2%, but distance can help mitigate this negative pathway; for every one mile increase between stores, revenue loss is stemmed by as much as 28.1%.

Although most hotel customers are not local, this effect might be operative in online choice settings in which a consumer sees multiple same-brand locations available in a specific area (cf. [13]). One extension of brand awareness impacting positive pathways is via cross-brand effects. In our context, an example of cross-brands is hotel locations with overlapping monikers, such as Hyatt Place and Hyatt House. Given the prominence of the Hyatt chain name, its use in multiple locations might boost demand for these outlets. This may increase brand awareness via multiple exposures and market prevalence.</p><a id="AN0155817135-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-9" title="Brand quality signaling">Brand quality signaling</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Multiple locations can also act as a quality signal, much as advertising communicates quality ([<a id="bib1up

When multiple products share a common brand name, this acts as a nontrivial "performance bond," a credible indicator assuring consumers that products are of high quality, thereby lifting sales of all products under certain conditions ([43]). Costly brand and infrastructure investments communicate a pledge to a prespecified quality level for both existing and new hotels.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This logic might be moderated by brand type and booking channel. For example, a quality signal might be more diagnostic for newer than for older, more established brands because consumers may perceive greater purchase uncertainty associated with new brands, and the quality signal acts as an assurance in the consumer's choice process. Similarly, the signal might be more pronounced in channels in which customers do not have strong brand loyalty or product experience. As an example, when a consumer sees multiple Marriott locations in a purchase channel that overviews multiple brands, the cluster of outlets may be a more diagnostic quality signal (i.e., the brand's commitment to a market area) than for a customer using Marriott's booking channel. A prominent avenue for quality signaling is online travel agency (OTA) channels: platforms such as Expedia and Kayak rely heavily on sponsor advertising, and these efforts are another means by which firms can signal brand quality to customers.</p><a id="AN0155817135-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-10" title="Consumer learning">Consumer learning</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consumer learning across similar brands occurs (<a id="bib1up

Thus, the first scenario can be purely cognitive: consumers form a quality perception, and existing brand quality inferences spill over to the new, similar brand entrant. In this context, online reviews from other guests may enable a customer to pool their experiences to infer hotel quality, potentially improving utility for specific brands.

In contrast, we micro-model customers' heterogeneous demand response to encroachment while abstracting away from modeling the firm's dynamic entry. Further, we control for the firms' entry decision using fixed effects and uncertainty in the exact timing of hotel entries. A more comprehensive approach would be to micro-model both heterogeneous demand response and a firm's dynamic entry decision with endogenous prices accounting for the demand response to the number of same brand outlets, but we leave this to future research.</p><a id="AN0155817135-12"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-12" title="Customer Preference">Customer Preference</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consider a geographic market m in time t, in which H (or  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">mt</mi></mrow></msub></math>  to be precise) hotels compete.

The competitor demand information was collected by the chain to ensure that a relevant, competitive set determines each franchisee's market; this value is verified via mutual discussion with the franchisee. For example, suppose two franchisees are in a given market: franchisee 1 and franchisee 2. Also suppose that the demand for month t is 10 and 20 for the two hotels, respectively. Additionally, assume that the surveyed competitors' demand for the period is 30 and 35, respectively. Market potential in month t is then max(franchisee 1 market potential, franchisee 2 market potential) = max(10 + 30 = 40, 20 + 35 = 55) = 55 hotel nights. We then again take the maximum of such market potential across time periods for the market.

One constraint is that the data do not include the address or location of each hotel. The location information provided is a geographic tract, which is defined by the combination of a metropolitan statistical area designation and location type (e.g., near an airport, highway or resort; suburban). For example, in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan statistical area, the Oakland airport and San Francisco downtown area are provided as two separate tracts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One problem is that some tracts may encompass multiple local markets. For example, three major highways crossing the state lie within the "Wyoming Interstate" tract. It would be erroneous to assume that all the hotels along these highways compete against one another (for a map of this area, see Web Appendix W4.1). Their inclusion could result in unreasonable parameter estimates, and more importantly, they do not reflect local franchisee competition, which is crucial to correctly specify Equation 5. We exclude rural metro/towns and suburban areas citing a similar argument. Therefore, we exclude such tracts (i.e., suburban, rural metro/town, and interstate locations) from estimation and retain tracts that are more likely to reflect a single market: airports, resorts, and urban areas. Absent more granularity and location information, we are unable to accord all the excluded tract data to the necessary unit of analysis. We also exclude markets with a single hotel of the focal chain during the entire period, as they may not be representative markets where our counterfactual simulations are relevant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Web Appendix W4 details the process of tract exclusion and considers various empirical tests to justify their exclusion.

Importantly, including suitably matched excluded suburban and rural metro locations that are likely small, well-defined markets yields similar results (see Web Appendix W4.4), which suggests that our findings are not limited to urban, airport, and resort locations but can generalize to suburban and rural metro/town locations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The final estimation sample consists of 21,644 hotel-market-month observations of 447 unique hotels in 128 geographic markets across 34 states.

Out of 447 franchisees, 127 entered the market during the data period.

Specifically, the first instrument is the average hotel size (i.e., number of hotel rooms) of all other hotels in the chain, and the second instrument is all hotels of differing brands of the focal chain in the market. The number of rooms in each hotel is determined by the combination of the availability of land for commercial use and the local government's zoning restrictions on the land use (e.g., the total number of floors due to height restrictions or the shape of the building) that are deemed to be exogenous with respect to the demand shock  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi></mrow><mi>ξ</mi></math>  .[10] Web Appendix W5 provides the test results of various instrumental variables. In the estimation, we also include functions of these instrumental variables and cost shifters such as the median wages of desk clerks and room service personnel.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another endogeneity concern involves the positive pathway variable as defined by the number of same-brand hotels in a market. Part of  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>ξ</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">hmt</mi></mrow></msub></math>  may contain unobserved heterogeneity that affects the number of hotels of the encroached brand in a given market. One way to deal with this concern is to include market dummies. However, market dummies may not be sufficient to control for unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, a hotel within walking distance to a popular tourist attraction (e.g., Disney World) would draw higher customer preference over a hotel that is far from it, despite competing in the same geographic market. We therefore include individual hotel dummies (  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>ξ</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi></mrow></msub></math>  ) as part of product characteristics.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While individual hotel dummies control for endogeneity from time-consistent demand heterogeneity, concerns remain about market-specific time-varying unobservables. Because the positive pathway is proxied by the number of same-brand hotels and its change in a market, if such unobserved heterogeneity is correlated with different hotel entry patterns, it can ultimately bias the estimate ([29]; [35]). We address this issue in several ways. First, we include fixed effects specified at the market × six-month level to flexibly control for the unobservables that may influence hotel entry and, thus, the change in the number of same-brand hotels. The fixed effects also account for time-changing outside options to some degree by allowing them to have different intercepts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we exploit the institutional knowledge of the industry regarding the timing of hotel entry. This entry decision may be decided at large time intervals (e.g., hotel entry planned in the second half of 2015); interviews with chain executives reveal that the exact timing of entry is difficult to predict due to the nature of the commercial real estate development process. This timing varies within a six-month window, depending on many unpredictable external forces, such as financing commercial real estate mortgages, passing inspections, and obtaining permits from local government. Therefore, we assume that the variation in the number of same hotel brands is exogenous within a six-month window.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This approach is consistent with the precedent of [12], who similarly assumes exogenous entry timing of generic drugs due to unpredictable FDA approval processes. We first checked the validity of this assumption by showing that the month in the six-month window cannot predict entry (see Web Appendix W2.2). We checked robustness of the results with additional control variables (see Web Appendix W2.3). Additionally, we examine incumbents' demand and price surrounding the entries of same and different brands and find that both increase only for same brands post entry (Web Appendices W6 and W7, respectively). These results corroborate our modeling approach that customer utility or willingness to pay increases only in the case of same brand encroachment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Since we only observe hotels from one chain, it is difficult to completely rule out the possibility that the entry timing in this chain may coincide with entry/exit of unobserved nonchain hotels. Two factors mitigate this concern. First, the uncertainty in the commercial real estate development process equally applies to unobserved hotels. Thus, it is unlikely that their entry/exit patterns will systematically coincide with our chain's entry timing within the six-month window and result in an overestimate of our results.[11] Second, we do not observe the full range of competitive options, which can lead to an attenuation bias via measurement error (i.e., our estimates may be conservative; for a similar setting in the airline industry, see [34]). Finally, we consider other endogeneity concerns (e.g., the granularity of our fixed effects, independent hotels rebranding as new hotels in our data) in Web Appendix W8.1.</p><a id="AN0155817135-23"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-23" title="Other Details of Estimation">Other Details of Estimation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The estimation strategy is based on the generalized method of moments estimation combined with micro moments (e.g., Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995 2004) to estimate customers' heterogeneous demand response in terms of the percentage of business stays.

The price coefficient remains positive and statistically significant, an unconventional finding.

The first-stage regression results show that the instruments have enough explanatory power with the first-stage F-statistics of 112.9.

Among the chain's brands, two have similar names (e.g., brands A and AB): brand A's moniker is one word, and brand AB has two words starting with brand A. The second word (B) does not directly signal superior overall quality but refers instead to the speed of service. If positive pathways are generated via the number of outlets with same brand monikers, we may observe a positive pathway not only between two outlets of the A brand, but also between A and AB brands.

We consider positive pathway effects across booking channels that support varying degrees of purchase intent and brand loyalty. One advantage of OTA channels such as Expedia or Orbitz is that they allow customers to compare across brands and options in terms of price, dates, and locations, which may be particularly valuable to customers who are seeking a specific type of deal and are open to a range of brands. OTA customers may be more likely to make occasional purchases and may not be brand loyal. In contrast, customers who book through a chain's official website are likely to have a preference for the brand and may not need an array of brand options for their purchase; they may be brand loyal or repeat customers. A positive pathway for demand may be less likely for this group due to saturation or ceiling effects, relative to OTA channel customers. Put differently, OTA consumers are more likely to benefit from a positive pathway, and this impact should be observable via heightened demand as encroachment increases.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We investigate this possibility by estimating a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for different online channel demand over brief windows (±3 months) around hotel entries for incumbent hotels, excluding the entered hotels. Details and results of the estimation are included in Web Appendix W11. We find that the incumbent's demand (9.946, <em>p</em> &lt; .10) and the proportion of demand (.013, <em>p</em> &lt; .05) through OTAs increase relative to other brands when a same-brand hotel enters the market. However, there is no significant corresponding effect through the chain's website channel. These significant interaction terms support our contention that same brand encroachment spurs a positive pathway effect and increases customer preference in OTA channels. Thus, incumbents benefit more from purchases in the OTA channel than the chain's channels. We evaluated the price response to determine whether a demand increase in the OTA channel decreases the overall price (hotel revenue per room). We find an increase in price for same brand incumbents post-entry, suggesting higher willingness to pay in customer utility (see Web Appendix W7 for further details).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We conduct similar analyses with offline booking channels associated with the chain, namely, traditional travel agents and call centers, but did not find any significant results. We conjecture that because travel agents are experienced in hotel bookings, they are less influenced by the addition of same brands. In addition, customers who book through the chain's call centers, like those who book through the chain's website, may have brand loyalty or preference that would make them less sensitive (i.e., a ceiling effect) to same brand encroachment.</p><a id="AN0155817135-36"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-36" title="Explanations of Observed Positive Pathways">Explanations of Observed Positive Pathways</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We next consider various explanations for the observed positive pathways.

Evidence of an additional positive pathway on customer utility for cross-brands and a moderating effect of newer brand outlets further corroborates this possibility. Additionally, the demand patterns show that consumers who purchase through the chain's booking channels (as opposed to OTA channels) are less likely to reflect a positive pathway effect, possibly due to brand loyalty and familiarity. Online advertising in OTA channels may also result in greater exposure of same brand hotels, which would increase brand awareness and quality signaling. This is consistent with our finding in Table W22.</p><a id="AN0155817135-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-39" title="Consumer learning">Consumer learning</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We have suggested that a possible positive pathway might arise if consumers learn from the presence of multiple brand outlets. Although our hotel-level data prohibit us from isolating this effect at the customer level, we explore this potential mechanism via an online experiment. If learning improves as the number of hotels in a market (i.e., brand exposure) increases, consumers may learn about hotel quality more accurately (i.e., correct quality association of the brand with more outlets), absent more information such as budget constraints, pricing, location, and so on. Better learning would thus be evidenced by greater accuracy in markets with more hotels regardless of the hotel quality level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We test this possibility using a design in which we manipulate hotel quality (high vs. low) and number of hotels in a market (two vs. five) in a 2 × 2 between-subjects design. The dependent variable is the recall accuracy of the focal hotel brand quality. If the consumer learning mechanism holds, one would expect that recall inaccuracy would be higher in the two-location condition than the five-location condition. Web Appendix W12 contains more details regarding data collection, stimuli, and analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The results are supportive: inaccuracy is significantly higher in the two-location than the five-location conditions across both high- and low-quality hotels. When there are fewer hotel outlets, the inaccuracy is mainly driven by the participants' reported ratings gravitating toward the condition mean, consistent with an explanation of not learning well. As a result, for higher-than-average hotel quality (i.e., as in our data), more same-brand hotels are associated with higher perceived quality. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the possibility that more outlets can increase preference via consumer learning, supporting a positive pathway effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More broadly, our results suggest that customer utility and market demand can be positively impacted by the addition of a new outlet when the addition is of the same brand, a newer brand, a cross brand, or purchased in an OTA channel.</p><a id="AN0155817135-40"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-40" title="Unlikely Explanations">Unlikely Explanations</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0155817135-41"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-41" title="Scarcity">Scarcity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If consumers prefer scarce boutique hotels (e.g., Hotel Indigo) over more standard hotel offerings with wide market coverage (e.g., Hilton Garden Inn), then the existence of multiple establishments of the same brand would decrease utility for the encroached brands.

It illustrates how removal of an encroaching outlet impacts the remaining hotels' optimal pricing and customers' subsequent hotel choice. The second counterfactual explores a key boundary condition of intrabrand competition: markets with varying same brand density.

We compare this simulated market outcome to the current model estimates and quantify the net aggregate effect on the remaining franchisees' performance. Because we do not have data on hotels outside the chain, our results assume that such hotels would not respond to the simulated policy changes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We consider all combinations of the removal of a single same brand hotel using the following process: first, in each market, one same brand hotel is removed. If there are three brand A hotels, then one is randomly selected (A1) for removal. Second, the remaining hotels (A2 and A3) reoptimize their prices, according to Equations 6 and 8. Third, market outcomes—including franchisee price, demand, revenues, and profits, as well as franchisor revenues and profits—are then recalculated. Finally, the foregoing three steps are repeated for each remaining hotel (A2 and A3) and across all markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We further decompose the impact of encroachment reduction by considering its effects on same and different brand outlets. Table 8, Panel A, reflects the performance impact on revenues and profits with one fewer same brand outlet. The first column reflects the simulation results (i.e., less encroachment), the second column reflects our model estimates (i.e., more encroachment), the third column reflects the mean percentage change between the foregoing, and the fourth column reports 95% confidence intervals. The overall impact of more encroachment results in an average revenue and profit loss of 5.3% (i.e., −$43,810 in revenue and −$26,090 in profit per month) for all incumbents. This result is consistent with the negative pathway findings in the empirical literature. This value is meaningful, as the "impact threshold," or the minimum drop in revenue that must be observed for a franchisee to bring suit for encroachment in Iowa, is 5% (Iowa Code 523 H, 1995).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Decomposing this further for same- and different-brand incumbents, we find that the effect is even greater on different-brand franchisees in the franchise system, with revenues and profits declining significantly by 7%–8% (i.e., −$59,834 in revenue and −$35,586 in profit per month). In contrast, more encroachment has little to no impact on same brand franchisees: although revenues decrease significantly (i.e., −$5,914 per month or −.58%, 95% CI [−.68%, −.48%]), the impact on profits is not statistically significant (−$3,659 per month or −.07%, 95% CI [−.18%,.03%]). Given that franchisors earn a royalty rate on revenues and franchisees are profit maximizing, these effects are economically meaningful. The results suggest that while a negative pathway dominates for different brands, a positive pathway seems to mostly offset a negative pathway for same brands (i.e., mitigation). This represents a critical contribution to our understanding of encroachment.</p><a id="AN0155817135-46"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-46" title="Counterfactual 2: Brand Density Market Conditions">Counterfactual 2: Brand Density Market Conditions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another dimension to consider is the number of existing brands, or a brand's "density," in a market.

In contrast, in markets in which brand density is high, firms have more competition for customers; thus, we are likely to observe that negative pathway effects prevail.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Suppose there are two markets that vary in terms of the number of A hotels:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal"> Low-density market ("Market L") consists of two A hotels, one B hotel, one C hotel, and one D hotel.

We divide the data set into low (≤50%) and high (&gt;50%) same brand density ratio markets.[12] Note that the brand density ratio reflects the number of same-brand hotels over the franchisor's total number of hotels in the market. We provide further evidence that the brand density ratio is a good proxy for the same brand concentration with respect to all hotels, including hotels that are not part of the chain, in Web Appendix W14.1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 8, Panel B, displays the performance impact. Consistent with a negative pathway mechanism, encroachment generally hurts franchisees, reducing average revenue and profits by 4%–6% regardless of the market's brand density. This performance decrement increases for the remaining different brand franchisees, resulting in a reduction in revenue and profits of 7%–8% and replicating results from the previous counterfactual. In contrast, the performance decrement is minimized and can even be positive for same brand franchisees. In high-density markets, they experience only a 3% reduction in performance (−$18,954 in revenue and −$12,011 in profit per franchisee per month). In low-density markets, incumbent performance improves by approximately 2% ($4,349 in revenue and $2,914 in profit per franchisee per month).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 8.

Same brand franchisees have the same brand as the removed hotel in each iteration. Less encroachment means one less encroaching chain outlet in simulation. More encroachment reflects the main model estimates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 3 sheds further light on these point estimates by illustrating the distributions of franchisees' monthly revenue change: the midpoint of the graphs reflect no change, while areas to the right reflect the net outcome of a positive pathway dominating a negative pathway, reflected in higher franchisee revenues. Panel A of Figure 3 reflects the relative distributions for the first two cells of the last rows in Panel B. It is worth noting that the brand-density markets' plot is bimodal. We explore this further in Figure 3, Panels B and C.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 3.

In low-brand-density markets, a clear positive pathway impact is evident for same-brand franchisees; this plot is similar to the positive pathway impact for low-brand-density markets in Figure 3, Panel A. This distribution shift suggests that on average, 70% of franchisees benefit from having a same brand hotel added in their vicinity. With high brand density markets, revenues are generally lower, consistent with a negative pathway dominating; however, even under these conditions there is a sizable portion of revenue for which positive pathways dominate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Figure 3, Panel C, illustrates franchisee revenues decrease from the perspective of different brand outlets (i.e., the middle rows in Table 8, Panel B). This plot suggests that the addition of a different brand hotel hurts franchisee revenues regardless of market brand density. It also suggests that there are no positive pathway gains for outlets whose brand is different from the new outlet—only a negative pathway.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Collectively, the counterfactual analyses and associated plots provide a more nuanced understanding of the impact and market conditions under which positive and negative pathways to franchisee performance occur.

This growth may inevitably result in more same brand franchisees being located close to one another. Prior to our research, encroachment was only considered in terms of negative pathways. However, our work provides important insights into the circumstances under which this might not be the case. Adding a same brand outlet can in fact lead to positive pathways via customer utility enhancement, which can subsequently mitigate negative pathways and even improve franchisee revenue and profits for same brand outlets in low-brand-density markets.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The reduced negative performance impact of encroachment on same brand franchisees suggests that encroachment may not be as universally harmful as once thought. Moreover, the prevailing positive pathway increasing both revenues and profits in low-brand-density areas suggests that firms should seek to encroach more in those areas (i.e., strength in numbers). To this end, we find that newer brands benefit more, holding promise for market entry strategies, as do cross brand locations and OTA bookings. Our work calls for managers and researchers to rework their view of encroachment to recognize that it may not be unilaterally negative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond the hotel industry, if encroachment involves mostly negative pathways dominating positive pathways, one may not observe any increase in performance related to same brands. Alternatively, if products are well differentiated such that negative pathways are relatively small, newer brand franchisees may achieve improved performance with same brand encroachment. On the other hand, different brand encroachment does not involve positive pathways, so we expect it to be seen as an adverse event to incumbents in other industries as well.</p><a id="AN0155817135-49"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-49" title="Marketing implications">Marketing implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Encroachment has been a contentious issue in the marketplace, but our research is the first to identify potential benefits and positive pathways from the addition of a same brand via a customer-centric viewpoint. Our ability to trace these pathways to improved customer utility underscores the power of the customer in a research area that has mostly focused on the franchisor's view of the market. Encroachment can be positive through customer utility, and we demonstrate where and when these benefits occur.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Being the first to distinguish the performance impact for same- versus different-brand outlets in a franchise system adds nuance to our understanding of how franchise systems should go to market and how brand characteristics play into it. Specifically, franchisors might prioritize markets with low same brand density for more locations. In this regard, we observe that a positive pathway effect can increase franchisee revenues by 1.7%, reflecting a 2.3% improvement in profits. This illustrates the potential "sunny side" of this controversial phenomenon. Importantly, franchisors can be strategic about when and where to reduce or expand locations, particularly as it pertains to franchisee conflict or relationship improvement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regarding channel conflict, franchisors face a fundamental trade-off in achieving their expansion goals; prevailing in a particular conflict, such as encroachment, can come at the cost of less location expansion. Our work identifies an alternate path, suggesting that additional same brand locations can result in a win-win outcome in low-brand-density markets and with various brand characteristics.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is also worth noting that franchise contract specifics may make it difficult to generalize our results. For instance, encroachment is irrelevant in franchise chains that guarantee exclusive territories. Also, the type of franchising may affect generalizability. While many new franchises are business format franchising (i.e., franchisees pay running royalty payments to the franchisor as a percentage of sales), the traditional franchising model is still prevalent in sectors such as automobile dealerships and gasoline stations ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref84" title="9">9</a>]). In traditional formats, the franchisor sells the product to franchisees with the right to serve a certain geographic area instead of collecting ongoing royalties. Regardless of the format differences or other unique aspects of the hotel industry such as capacity constraints, we may yet observe positive pathways if brand awareness and quality signaling are relevant. We leave these issues for future research to verify.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From a consumer welfare perspective, our research sheds a new light on how to consider hotel choice offerings across a range of markets. Our findings of additional positive pathways (e.g., cross brands, newer brands, purchase channel types) to hotel performance suggest that such offerings might enhance consumer welfare in new markets and in the creation of valued product offerings. These insights are important for policies such as those described in <em>The Network Expansion Handbook</em>, which is developed by the International Franchise Association's Franchise Relations Committee to assist in establishing codes of conduct and setting expectations and compliance for encroachment practices.</p><a id="AN0155817135-50"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-50" title="Policy implications">Policy implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our counterfactual simulations help inform the fractious efforts around franchise regulation. Although franchisors may allow exclusive territories to individual franchisees, established franchisors often maintain legal rights in the final encroachment decision (for more detailed discussion, see [21]). However, the threat of litigation motivates franchisors to maintain goodwill. Our findings of prevailing positive pathways in low-brand-density markets and the substantially reduced negative pathway impact on same-brand incumbents indicate customer utility gains from having more same brand hotels. Future research might consider how a ban on same-brand encroachment, such as the Iowa Franchise Act of 1992, would affect customers.</p><a id="AN0155817135-51"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-51" title="Theoretical Implications">Theoretical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our finding that encroachment can be economically beneficial for same brand franchisees contributes to the literature, which has historically shown the opposite. Incorporating a consumer perspective represents a substantial departure from the dominant approach, which has historically focused on the franchisor's revenue and market share. Moreover, the customer's perspective enables us to illuminate the value of encroachment in terms of increased customer utility and demand for same brand franchisees. Although we find customer heterogeneity differences for hotel industry-specific factors such as business stays versus leisure stays, generalizability to other industries remains an area for future investigation. As an example, considering that hotel franchisees rely on out-of-town customers more than a fast food franchisee might, pathways for these two industries may differ.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expand the scope of research in the marketing literature on franchise management, which has mostly focused on issues of governance and enforcement ([<a id="bib3up

Our research highlights the phenomenon of encroachment as a substantive direction for future research in its own right.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our work contributes to the growing body of work on firm entry. Similar to [15] and [42], we allow both negative and positive outcomes from entry, albeit in a franchising context. Their results support the positive effects that arise from economy-of-scale gains on the supply side or a concentration of product category brand locations. We, in contrast, focus on the effect of multiple same brand outlets on customer demand as opposed to the use of multiple-store formats or category effects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Generalizing our findings beyond the hotel industry depends on industry-specific factors that may affect pathways.[13] For example, the magnitude of negative pathways may be different in other industries. One measure of this negative pathway is own-price elasticity. For example, [35] find an elasticity of −2.09 among fast food franchisees, and [26] finds −2.82 among auto radiator distribution franchisees. Our price elasticity of −1.33 suggests weaker negative pathways relative to these industries.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The findings also suggest that one would expect stronger positive pathways with newer brands. If an industry mostly consists of long-established brands with a high degree of familiarity, positive pathways may be small or difficult to measure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Future inquiries could consider these possibilities as well as identify additional moderating factors in which positive pathways might be operative. Historical or other secondary data analyses would assist in documenting the real financial and relational impact of encroachment for same brand outlets in low-brand-density markets. More broadly, such results could be investigated across other franchised service industries.</p><a id="AN0155817135-52"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817135-52" title="Limitations and Future Research">Limitations and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We acknowledge several considerations in the summation of our results. First, the data limitation on location information of hotels led us to mainly focus on well-defined markets such as downtown areas, airports, and resort towns to isolate encroachment effects. Can we observe the effect of encroachment in other markets? Including suburban and rural metro locations that are likely small, well-defined market yields similar results (Web Appendix W4.5), suggesting that our findings are not limited to downtown, airport, and resort locations. Further information on hotel location data in the excluded markets would allow us to break them into local markets for inclusion in our analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, while consumer learning remains a possible explanation for our findings, our static model is unable to fully capture potential dynamics. A dynamic model based on individual choice data and experience would be required to determine that learning has occurred. We leave this as an avenue for future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, from a modeling perspective, while our results are robust with more granular fixed effects, our market × time fixed effects may not fully capture all unobserved demand shocks, which can bias results. Individual-level customer panel data would have been useful for determining which demand side explanations—consumer learning, brand awareness, or quality signaling—dominate. Although our study focuses on the presence of same brand hotels, the role of online advertising and consumer search behavior would further shed light on this topic. These topics remain fruitful directions for the future.</p><a id="AN0155817135-53"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0155817135-53" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Hari Sridhar</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  TI Tongil Kim https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3277-4337 Sandy D.

The authors develop a model and first show how the cost and demand effects of reducing the product carbon footprint determine the profit-maximizing product design. They find that stronger climate concerns reduce the product carbon footprint, demand, the overall corporate carbon footprint and profit, but have an ambiguous impact on price. Next, the authors establish that offsetting carbon emissions can create a win-win outcome for the firm and the climate if the cost of compensation is sufficiently low. Going net zero leads to a win for society if the cost of offsetting is sufficiently low compared to the social cost of pollution created by the corporate carbon footprint. Third, the authors show how regulation in the form of a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax affects product design, firm profitability, and green technology adoption. Finally, the authors extend the analysis to a competitive scenario and show that going net zero creates a win-win-win outcome for the firm, the climate, and society if the offset technology is sufficiently effective.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: carbon footprint; carbon offsetting; climate impact; net-zero emissions; pricing</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The consequences of climate change have become apparent and touch every corner of our society. Public opinion has reached a point where "business as usual" is hard to justify, and many organizations are pressed to find solutions. For instance, "flight-shaming" and the European Green Deal ([22]) pose a threat to the business model of airlines ([<a id="bib7up

Amid much fanfare, most major carriers are studying or already adopting approaches that are broadly in line with the three-step process "measure, reduce, compensate" outlined in the United Nations Climate Neutral Now initiative ([57]), essentially pledging to operate "net-zero" flights in the short run. Similarly, the automotive industry must urgently find ways to replace combustion engines to meet the increasing demand for low-emission vehicles and more stringent emission targets ([27]). Car makers around the world are rushing to bring electric vehicles to the market at reasonable prices.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These recent developments, which generalize to organizations in logistics, fashion, retailing, and other sectors in the economy, underscore the importance of understanding climate concerns and making the necessary adjustments to one's offerings and prices. Marketing professionals play a critical role here because they are often tasked with sensing changes in consumer preferences and channeling them within an organization. According to a recent article, "chief marketing officers should be involved in the development of the sustainability strategy based on what they can bring to the table: customer data, market analysis and audience insights" ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref5" title="8">8</a>]). At the same time, however, marketing officials may lack the confidence to contribute to the debate and provide meaningful guidance to internal stakeholders ([43]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article develops a model that helps marketers address climate concerns by optimizing carbon footprinting and pricing. It is well documented that consumers have climate concerns ([63]; [64]) and that media coverage of climate change motivates consumers to make more sustainable consumption decisions ([11]; [30]). The starting point of our analysis is a monopoly setting in which the firm designs a product by choosing its product carbon footprint and price, hereinafter referred to simply as product design. Calculating product carbon footprints—the climate impact per unit of product in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions—is now common practice ([42]; [60]), and these footprints are routinely certified based on international accounting standards ([26]; [34]). Using terminology from the [26], we define the product carbon footprint as "cradle-to-gate emissions," which include production emissions (Scope 1) and emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2).[<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5_ref16" title="5">5</a>] Importantly, reducing the product carbon footprint has both a cost effect due to the change in the unit cost to produce a greener product and a demand effect due to consumers' climate concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The key difference from a standard model where the firm chooses price and (environmental) quality is that the total number of purchases made by consumers determines not only the firm's profit but also its corporate carbon footprint ([28])—the aggregate climate impact of the firm across all units sold. The corporate carbon footprint causes a market externality that depends on the strength of the climate concerns and that a regulator may want to control. Figure 1 illustrates how the interplay between firm and consumers drives the market outcome (comprising product design, firm performance, and climate impact) and climate externality, and the role played by the regulator intervening to limit corporate carbon footprints.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. The interplay between firm, consumers, and regulator and the resulting market outcome under climate concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We derive three key results from this initial framework. First, we show how the profit-maximizing product carbon footprint depends on the relative size of the cost and demand effects of reducing the product carbon footprint. This insight reflects the familiar return-on-quality logic in the marketing literature ([50]; [51]; [52]) but accounts for consumers' climate concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, we show the impact of stronger climate concerns on the profit-maximizing product design. We demonstrate that it is optimal for a firm to decrease the product carbon footprint, and analyze the impact on price. In addition, we show that stronger climate concerns reduce firm profit.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we show that stronger climate concerns reduce the overall corporate carbon footprint. This result occurs because stronger climate concerns reduce both the product carbon footprint and demand, which leads to a reduction in overall emissions. In other words, the greener product design further contributes to the reduction in overall emissions that results from the lower sales volume. Listening to the voice of consumers who demand greener products therefore helps organizations to reduce their corporate carbon footprint.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We then extend the analysis in several directions. First, we consider the profitability of carbon offsetting, which compensates for a carbon footprint by reducing, avoiding, or sequestering carbon emissions elsewhere on the planet ([25]). Carbon offsetting is feasible because carbon emissions are a global (rather than local) environmental problem. Projects that result in carbon offsets tend to focus on renewable energy (such as building wind farms that replace coal-fired power plants) or carbon sequestration in soils or forests (such as agroforestry and tree-planting activities). Specifically, we allow the firm to purchase carbon offsets to attain a net-zero corporate carbon footprint. As a result, a firm may be able to offer a climate-neutral product even if its carbon footprint prior to offsetting is positive. We show that it is optimal for firms to go net zero if the compensation cost is sufficiently low relative to the demand-enhancing effect of reducing the product carbon footprint to net zero. In this case, going net zero is a win-win strategy for the firm and the climate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we examine the profit-maximizing product design from a welfare perspective, effectively complementing the profit motive of the firm with respect for the environment and social justice ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref22" title="6">6</a>]; [32]; [35])—often referred to as the triple bottom line of profit, planet, and people ([21]). We show that, in the absence of carbon offsetting, the profit-maximizing corporate carbon footprint generally deviates from the socially optimal level. A net-zero corporate carbon footprint, in turn, is economically efficient if the cost of offsetting is sufficiently low compared with the social cost of the corporate carbon footprint.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we analyze how carbon regulation affects product design and the corporate carbon footprint. We study three common market interventions ([66]): carbon caps, cap-and-trade systems, and a carbon tax. We find that these interventions typically reduce firm profit. In addition, we show that these instruments are generally effective in curbing both the product carbon footprint and the corporate carbon footprint when taking the profit-maximizing price response into account. We also show how carbon regulation can accelerate green technology adoption.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we extend our analysis to competition and illustrate how competitive carbon offsetting emerges in equilibrium if the offset technology is sufficiently effective. From a policy perspective, this suggests that providing efficient carbon removal technologies can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Table 1 provides an overview of the key findings and highlights the insights for marketers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 1.

By endogenizing product design, this article also adds to the return-on-quality literature ([50]; [50]; [52]). Importantly, we provide a welfare analysis to understand the implications of product-design decisions for corporate social responsibility and thereby add to the sustainability literature in marketing ([<a id="bib9up

First, if lowering the product carbon footprint reduces unit cost, then it is optimal to increase efficiency and thereby increase "process quality" ([15]; [16]). Green cost cutting is more attractive when lowering the product carbon footprint not only reduces cost but also increases demand ([48]). This result helps explain why many sustainability efforts increase firm profit ([65]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, if lowering the product carbon footprint increases unit cost, there may be a trade-off between the cost effect and the demand effect. Absent a demand effect, reducing the product carbon footprint below that of the brown product only results in higher unit cost and is therefore suboptimal under profit maximization. However, when the increase in demand outweighs the impact of higher unit cost, firms should reduce the product carbon footprint relative to the brown product. In contrast to cost-cutting sustainability, cost-increasing sustainability reflects the idea that "major pressure for changing marketing practices may come from consumers themselves" ([37], p. 133) and can be viewed as one of the "sustainability programs worthy of the name" ([19]).

Stronger climate concerns increase the consumers' marginal disutility of raising κ, which motivates the firm to reduce the product carbon footprint to make the product more attractive to consumers.

This suggests an intuitive explanation for "dither and denial" ([62]) by polluting firms in the face of climate change ([38]; [40]). This result also points to a potential tension between product managers who tend to focus on profit and managers who are in charge of corporate social responsibility.

The reason is that stronger climate concerns reduce both the product carbon footprint and demand, which leads to a reduction in overall emissions. This is a strong result, because the positive demand effect of offering a greener product could be expected to compensate for the lower product carbon footprint—similar to the rebound effect from technological progress (Alcott 2005), which suggests that higher efficiency leads to an initial reduction in demand for a resource that is outweighed by a corresponding increase in demand due to relatively lower resource cost ("Jevons paradox"). In our setting, the rebound effect cannot occur because stronger climate concerns increase the disutility from a given carbon footprint (z<sub>λ</sub> (κ; λ) &gt; 0), which translates into an overall reduction in demand. In contrast, in a setting where z<sub>λ</sub> (κ; λ) &lt; 0, stronger climate concerns may lead to a rebound effect because of the resulting increase in demand, an outcome that is conceivable if consumers use the brown product (rather than the green product) as a reference point.[<a id="bib9up

To integrate these three ingredients into the analysis, we say that a firm behaves in a manner that is consistent with corporate social responsibility if it maximizes welfare.

Intuitively, a firm has an incentive to strategically distort the product carbon footprint to exploit pricing power, which leads to an economically inefficient product carbon footprint ([53]). Interestingly, under an offset strategy, profit-maximization may result in a net-zero corporate carbon footprint even if it is socially undesirable to fully compensate for the emissions because the firm does not factor in the social cost of carbon removal. However, if the carbon removal technology is sufficiently cost effective, the win-win outcome for the firm and the climate under an offset strategy translates into a win-win-win outcome and therefore produces benefits for society at large.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition, Proposition 5 sheds light on the controversial debate about carbon offsets that "have been used by polluters as a free pass for inaction" ([58]). The cost efficiency of carbon offsetting stems from the fact that emissions are compensated for in places where the cost of offsetting is low, typically in developing countries. While this makes sense from an economic perspective, managers have to bear in mind "whose mess this is" and that "some of these places would welcome investment in reforestation and afforestation, but they would also need to be able to integrate such endeavours into development plans which reflect their people's needs" ([20]).</p><a id="AN0155817131-9"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817131-9" title="Carbon Regulation">Carbon Regulation</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regulators increasingly try to limit carbon emissions of firms to meet climate targets and address climate change.

To illustrate the emergence of competitive carbon offsetting, we consider symmetric firms with  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>  and let λ = 1 represent strong climate concerns.

Then, if the offset technology is sufficiently effective, each firm benefits from adopting an offset strategy irrespective of the rival's choice of strategy. This leads to a net-zero industry carbon footprint and improves welfare.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To understand the intuition for this result, consider the profits that each firm can earn in the four possible outcomes represented in Figure 3. From firm 1's point of view, it is always more profitable to adopt an offset strategy than a no-offset strategy, no matter whether firm 2 chooses a no-offset strategy (which yields profit  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>  ) or an offset strategy (which yields profit  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac><mo>&gt;</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>  ). Because the firms are symmetric, the same logic applies to firm 2, no matter whether firm 1 chooses a no-offset strategy or an offset strategy. In other words, each firm can create a win-win for itself and the climate by adopting the offset strategy—irrespective of the rival's choice of strategy. Therefore, the offset strategy is strictly dominant for each firm, and competitive carbon offsetting emerges in equilibrium.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 3. Possible outcomes and corresponding profits for c10=c20=1 and λ=1, where the top left number is the profit of Firm 1 and the bottom right number the profit of Firm 2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interestingly, Proposition 10 further shows that if the offset technology is sufficiently cost effective, competitive forces can create a win-win-win outcome for each firm, the climate, and society. Therefore, choosing an offset strategy is consistent with pursuing corporate social responsibility. This has an important implication for policy makers: Providing efficient carbon removal technologies can accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon economy by providing incentives for firms to offer products and services with a net-zero product carbon footprint.</p><a id="AN0155817131-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817131-17" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This article explored how organizations should design a product by choosing the carbon footprint and price in a market with climate concerns.

With this in mind, the current section elaborates on the implications of our results for organizations, policy makers, and consumers. We end by discussing some of the limitations of our work and avenues for future research.</p><a id="AN0155817131-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817131-18" title="Implications for Organizations">Implications for Organizations</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When confronted with climate concerns, the first response of an organization should be to assess the carbon footprint of its product and understand the impact on cost. If it is possible to reduce the product carbon footprint and reduce cost, eliminating waste (e.g., improving energy management) and adjusting price is the obvious consequence. However, if reducing the product carbon footprint is costly, it is imperative for marketers to understand the trade-off with demand (via, e.g., market research). They can then advise their organizations on how to adjust the product design in response to stronger climate concerns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another key consideration is how changes in product design affect the organization's overall climate impact. Because marketers lower the product carbon footprint and adjust price in response to stronger climate concerns, the changes in product design lead to a lower corporate carbon footprint as both the product carbon footprint and demand are reduced. Therefore, greener products lead to greener organizations. At the same time, the consumer pressure for greener products reduces profit. To save the cost of making the product greener, organizations may decide to go net zero by offsetting the carbon emissions. For example, UPS offers a carbon-neutral shipping service with net-zero carbon emissions ([59]), while Kering "will become carbon neutral within its own operations and across the entire supply chain" ([36]). EasyJet announced its decision to go net zero and claims to be "the first major airline to offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for every single flight" ([18]). In theory, net-zero carbon footprints are consistent with corporate social responsibility if the social cost of carbon compensation is sufficiently low. However, in practice, carbon compensation remains an imperfect solution that falls short of green product development.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third consideration is whether competition forces otherwise brown organizations to offset their carbon emissions. We showed that competition has the potential to prevent an industry from a race to the bottom where firms offer brown products. For instance, several European airlines offset their carbon emissions on domestic flights to compete for climate-concerned consumers.</p><a id="AN0155817131-19"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817131-19" title="Implications for Policy Makers">Implications for Policy Makers</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While carbon regulation effectively limits the organization's overall climate impact, it imposes a cost of regulation on organizations. This is arguably the reason why policy makers hesitate to implement effective carbon regulation. Our analysis shows that the mere threat of regulation negatively affects firm profitability. On the positive side, a well-designed market intervention benefits consumers and society at large, and stimulates green technology adoption.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More generally, our work suggests that society should put a price on carbon emissions. Carbon offsets and carbon taxes achieve this goal. However, carbon offsets do not provide an incentive for firms to invest in greener technologies and, therefore, should be considered an interim measure until new technologies become available. The recent call by the United Nations Global Compact to set an internal price at a minimum of $100 per metric ton by 2020 is an attempt to price carbon emissions and put climate change at the heart of corporate strategy ([56]).</p><a id="AN0155817131-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817131-20" title="Implications for Consumers">Implications for Consumers</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our research suggests that organizations should act on consumers' climate concerns even if it reduces their profit, because not doing so would result in even lower profit.

Stronger climate concerns also increase the profitability of carbon offsetting, which may stimulate the transition to a net-zero carbon economy.

Exploring preferences is key to understanding the impact of stronger climate concerns on product design and the overall corporate carbon footprint. One approach is to assume that climate concerns are influenced by opinion leaders. Another option is to assume that the organization can influence climate concerns via persuasive advertising. Yet another issue for future research is whether changes in climate concerns monotonically affect purchase decisions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, future research could consider emissions that occur during the consumption stage (Scope 3). This would allow marketers to understand what drives the life-cycle carbon footprint of a product (a cradle-to-grave approach). The interesting aspect of such an extension is that the emissions in the consumption phase are driven by consumer behavior that cannot be easily influenced by the firm.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, it would be interesting to study the role of competition in a more nuanced way. A limitation of our approach is that it ignores the possibility of market expansion. Researchers could also study the impact of carbon regulation and taxation on industry dynamics and their potential to accelerate the transition to a zero carbon economy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, this article highlights some of the complexities and consequences of climate concerns on product design and corporate carbon emissions. Hopefully, this will spur further research into understanding the impact of climate-dependent preferences and exploring the system-wide effects of government actions, including the determination of offset prices. We also hope to see multiple approaches brought to bear in the area, including agent-based simulations, data-based empirical analyses, and natural experiments. Ideally, this will lead to creative regulations and behaviors that result in win-win-win outcomes for consumers, organizations, and the environment or at least, absent that, better understanding of the trade-offs being made among the three parties.</p><a id="AN0155817131-22"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link"

Informational asymmetries thus arise that can lead to exchange uncertainties between buyers and freelancers. Conventional marketing thought recommends reducing such uncertainty. However, uncertainty reduction and uncertainty management theories indicate that buyers and freelancers might benefit more from balancing—rather than reducing—uncertainty, such as by strategically adhering to or deviating from common communication principles. With dyadic analyses of calls for bids and bids from a leading online freelance marketplace, this study reveals that buyers attract more bids from freelancers when they provide moderate degrees of task information and concreteness, avoid sharing personal information, and limit the affective intensity of their communication. Freelancers' bid success and price premiums increase when they mimic the degree of task information and affective intensity exhibited by buyers. However, mimicking a lack of personal information and concreteness reduces freelancers' success, so freelancers should always be more concrete and offer more personal information than buyers. These contingent perspectives offer insights into buyer–seller communication in two-sided online marketplaces. They clarify that despite, or sometimes due to, communication uncertainty, both sides can achieve success in the online gig economy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: business-to-business exchange; gig economy; multisided platforms; online freelance marketplaces; text analysis; uncertainty management</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online freelance marketplaces, such as Upwork, Fiverr, and PeoplePerHour, have prompted massive transformations in business-to-business (B2B) markets ([13]; [82]). In particular, they allow buyers to post gigs, or short-term service projects, which initiate reverse auctions whereby interested freelance workers submit bids to offer their services ([39]). In these digital environments, buyers and freelancers often devote rather limited time and attention to detailed assessments and instead make choices on the basis of rational value expectations or prices ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref4" title="2">2</a>]). In addition, online freelance marketplaces suffer from information asymmetries because they rely on text-based messages, which can create uncertainty and hinder the exchange ([34]; [77]). Imagine a buyer wants to hire a freelancer to optimize their pet website's search rankings, so they post a call for bids, requesting "someone for an SEO job." In response, Freelancer A might vaguely promise, "I have plenty of experience writing content that users find interesting to improve the quality and quantity of your traffic," whereas Freelancer B more concretely states, "I have four years of experience writing articles and blogs that engage users and are SEO-friendly. For example, I could focus on interest pieces like the everyday lives of pets." The communication of both the buyer and freelancer create different degrees of uncertainty, likely impacting who applies and who gets hired.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Uncertainty regarding communication can lead to various negative outcomes on both sides, including high rates (more than 50%) of service gigs that go unfulfilled ([36]), diminished bid success, and less-than-optimal pricing for freelancers ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref8" title="2">2</a>]). However, parties in B2B exchanges can also strategically leverage uncertainty in their communication to achieve more effective outcomes, such as when negotiators conceal information ([69]) or when ambiguous contracts help reduce litigation concerns and increase cooperation ([81]). Buyers and freelancers on online freelance marketplaces engage in a form of B2B exchange, so we propose that they similarly might balance their communication efforts by strategically reducing and increasing uncertainty to maximize their exchange success. In our previous example, by staying vague and without any specific direction from the buyer, Freelancer A might be trying to keep multiple options open and avoid overpromising outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addition to fundamental questions regarding how to manage uncertainty in B2B exchanges ([50]; [63]), we seek to address the role of communication in such exchanges ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref13" title="7">7</a>]; Rajdeep et al. 2015; see also Web Appendices A and B).

					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref16" title="8">8</a>]). Using Grice's ([27]) communication principles, we argue that greater provision of task and personal information might reduce uncertainty in service exchanges ([54]) but could also lead to information overload or disagreements ([18]; [40]). Presenting information in a more concrete (cf. abstract) manner or with greater affective intensity also can reduce uncertainty ([27]; [28]; [61]). But again, too much concreteness or affective intensity might lead to restrictive communication that hinders exchanges ([18]; [37]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We apply this theoretical reasoning to exchanges in online freelance marketplaces, in which buyers post calls for bids to attract as many freelancers as possible to apply ([36]). These buyers face a trade-off between reducing uncertainty for freelancers (e.g., providing more information, using less ambiguity) and still efficiently granting them sufficient interpretative freedom. Theorists concur that principles for using relevant information or less ambiguity often get deliberately flouted in conversation, such as when an individual is attempting to save face ([23]) or please a counterpart ([44]). If different communication strategies might entice more freelancers to bid, buyers could establish optimal designs for calls for bids.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In response to those calls for bids, freelancers write and submit their bids. In doing so, these freelancers also must manage uncertainty. Thus, they might benefit from matching or mimicking the communication approach adopted by the prospective buyer that issued the call ([78]). Communicative mimicry can evoke similarity perceptions, which tend to increase receivers' sense of rapport and reduce their uncertainty ([75]). Research on adaptive selling recommends matching the buyer's communication (e.g., [57]; [72]). However, in some situations, deviations also may be beneficial ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref33" title="1">1</a>]), so we consider a more nuanced distinction related to the level at which the similarity occurs. Furthermore, if freelancers compete on price, they may become enmeshed in a self-defeating value trap ([34]; [76]) in which they win more bids but earn less revenue. Strategically mimicking or deviating from a buyer's communication might provide a viable means to winning more gigs without being trapped. We accordingly suggest how freelancers should calibrate their bid formulations to improve their bid success and achieve a price premium.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Using a unique, large-scale data set of calls for bids and bids, obtained from a leading online freelance marketplace, along with a series of multilevel models that account for endogeneity, we establish three main contributions. First, we determine the effects of buyers' strategic communications in two-sided online marketplaces ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref36" title="7">7</a>]). Rather than uncritically recommending that communication should always be informative and unambiguous, we specify the diminishing, even adverse consequences that can result if buyers relay too much task or personal information in a very concrete, intense manner. Second, in an extension of research into adaptive selling ([57]; [78]), we reveal how freelancers' dyadic communicative mimicry affects bid success. Mimicry effects are contingent on the communicative aspect and the buyer's relative uses of each aspect. As we show, mimicking buyers in terms of the provision of task information and use of affective intensity increases bid success. In contrast, we find that freelancers should always offer more personal information and be more concrete in their bid formulations than buyers' calls for bids. Third, we offer insights into how freelancers can avoid predatory pricing ([13]) and escape a value trap ([76]). By strategically managing uncertainty according to the information communicated, and by managing the manner in which they do so, freelancers can earn price premiums.</p><a id="AN0157259282-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-2" title="Online Freelance Marketplace Exchanges">Online Freelance Marketplace Exchanges</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Online freelance marketplaces that feature reverse auctions rely on a three-stage process ([34]; [39]). First, in seeking a suitable freelancer, a buyer describes a gig or short-term service project in a call for bids. Second, multiple freelancers apply by formulating and submitting bids that describe themselves, the service offering, and the price requested. Third, the buyer compares the bids and selects a freelancer to complete the project. The outcome of each stage defines exchange success. That is, buyers' success results from a large pool of viable freelance offers. A higher number of bids increases the chances of finding a suitable freelancer for the gig ([35], [36]). Freelancers' success depends on whether their bids are chosen, preferably at a price premium ([13]; [32]). In this context, a price premium is the monetary amount in excess of the buyer's original payment offer (i.e., expected price; [26]; [73]). Buyers might pay a premium beyond their original payment offer for various reasons, including their willingness or "need to compensate the seller for reducing transaction risks" ([<a id="bib2up

In competitive online marketplaces, freelancers also might encounter value traps in which they wind up selling more of their services at a lower price ([<a id="bib2up

In this sense, freelancers' success depends on winning the bid but also earning price premiums (or avoiding discounts). Unlike traditional B2B exchanges, buyers' and freelancers' success hinges on textual communication ([13]; [36]). Comparing theories on uncertainty and the role of communication in producing or reducing it, we delineate how both buyers and freelancers may best strike a balance between providing more information and reducing ambiguity versus preserving some uncertainty and maintaining interpretative flexibility.</p><a id="AN0157259282-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-3" title="Conceptual Background">Conceptual Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Uncertainty reduction theory ([<a id="bib6up

Thus, uncertainty is inherent to any interaction. [22] suggests uncertainty depends on the ability to draw inferences from provided information content and the manner in which it is provided. Whereas uncertainty reduction theory predicts how communication can reduce uncertainty, uncertainty management theory examines how people cope with uncertainty, which may include efforts to increase uncertainty to attain beneficial outcomes ([<a id="bib8up

In such interactions, [27] suggests that four generalized cooperative communication principles (or maxims) apply. Three principles refer to what should be said: the quantity of information ("give as much information as is required and no more than is required"), its quality ("do not say what is false or that for which you lack adequate evidence"), and its relevance. The fourth principle, manner (be clear and avoid ambiguity), pertains to "how what is said is to be said" ([27], p. 46). In our study context, neither a buyer nor a freelancer can know upfront whether the other party might be lying, so truthfulness would have to be assumed prior to the exchange.

In service exchanges, the parties seek information about the task and the person who will complete it ([54]). A greater degree of task information should reduce uncertainty about functional service aspects ([54]). By self-disclosing greater degrees of personal information, a sender also provides a receiver with more information about the self ([15]).

In B2B relationships, reducing uncertainty increases exchange effectiveness ([29]; [50]; [63]). In Web Appendix A, we offer an overview of some key empirical marketing studies on B2B communication aspects. Specifically in online freelance marketplaces, which are relatively anonymous, the required coordination and dependence between rational buyers and freelancers may increase their need for information and clarity ([13]; [34]). Thus, for example, reputation cues commonly appear in online freelance marketplaces as a way to reduce uncertainty and facilitate exchanges ([34]). More broadly, reducing uncertainty by adhering to [27] principles in dyadic buyer–freelancer communications may boost exchange success.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, people experience uncertainty differently and do not always prefer to reduce it ([<a id="bib8up

For example, [38] find that a lack of concreteness aids consumers' initial online searches because such vague queries return a greater variety of search results. In collective bargaining settings, seasoned negotiators use concealment and ambiguity to enhance the likelihood of agreement ([69]). In B2B exchanges, parties can use less information and more ambiguity strategically to accomplish specific goals ([<a id="bib3up

Even if such efforts are not universally favored, uncertainty-cultivating communication provides benefits by allowing different receivers to perceive multiple different meanings simultaneously ([18]). Moreover, communication theorists concur that people sometimes deliberately flout or violate [27] conversation principles, such as when they intentionally maintain uncertainty to save face ([23]) or please a counterpart ([44]). Subverting the principles is not necessarily less cooperative, and furthermore, the purpose of communication is not always to be as informative and clear as possible. Arguably, cooperative principles encourage reasonable adherence, not compulsion. Thus, strategically allowing recipients to develop a broader range of possible interpretations by maintaining some level of uncertainty might facilitate buyer–freelancer exchanges.</p><a id="AN0157259282-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-7" title="Research Propositions">Research Propositions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259282-8"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-8" title="Managing Freelancers&#39; Uncertainty in Calls for Bids">Managing Freelancers' Uncertainty in Calls for Bids</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Freelancers choose whether to offer their services in response to a buyer's call for bids.

If freelancers evaluate this information favorably, they develop more positive dispositions and are more likely to apply ([72]). As prior research establishes, more information enhances communication outcomes in business settings by reducing uncertainty. For example, studying web forums, [79] indicate that the breadth of information provided by a sender affects receivers' objective judgments of the value of that information. [49] find that greater degrees of monetary information increase peer-to-peer lending, and [41] shows that more task information increases the time and commitment sellers allocate to a buyer. Greater degrees of personal information also reduce uncertainty, increase trust ([55]), and enhance performance on crowdsourcing platforms ([68]). Such self-disclosure can strengthen ongoing buyer–seller relations as well ([14]). In contrast, a greater proportion of nonrelevant information (i.e., a lesser degree of relevant information) increases uncertainty ([<a id="bib9up

Because greater degrees of task and personal information in calls for bids help reduce freelancers' uncertainty, freelancers who believe they qualify for the gig should be more willing to submit bids.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, excessive relevant information may be ineffective, even if it reduces freelancers' uncertainty. That is, if buyers provide excessive details about the task, the gig may appear too restrictive or prescriptive ([18]), which might not appeal to freelancers. For example, leaving detailed information out of contracts ([21]) or negotiations ([69]) represents a tactic for improving exchange performance. In a downsizing context, a greater degree of information provision can increase uncertainty and negative reactions ([31]). For freelancers, excessive information can feel overwhelming and can limit their motivation, opportunity, or ability to process the information and submit bids ([40]). A buyer that self-discloses a high amount of personal information might also appear less attractive as a prospective business contact ([12]). Because extensive self-disclosures are unusual in initial B2B online exchanges ([46]), such disclosures might be perceived as inappropriate ([59]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, we argue that moderate degrees of task and personal information in calls for bids relate to more freelancer bids. Buyers who provide greater degrees of task and personal information should attract more bids, but beyond a moderate degree (i.e., a very dense provision of relevant information), providing still greater degrees of task and personal information may decrease the number of bids. We thus propose a curvilinear relationship:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> P1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Extremely sparse and extremely dense degrees of (a) task and (b) personal information in calls for bids yield fewer freelance bids than moderate degrees.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259282-10"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-10" title="Communication manner">Communication manner</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In calls for bids, buyers can vary the concreteness and affective intensity with which they describe the gig.

Greater concreteness and affective intensity can be more efficient because recipients can process the information with less time and effort ([37]; [61]). These approaches also tend to result in communication that is more persuasive, memorable, and accessible than communication that uses predominantly abstract or unemotional wording ([28]; [37]). In other settings, greater concreteness increases consumer satisfaction with employee interactions and purchase likelihood ([61]). Greater degrees of intensity achieved through proportionally more affective words provide accessible, diagnostic signals to customers ([52]). They can also sway business partners' decisions when used as inspirational appeals ([72]). Finally, greater concreteness and affective intensity provide heuristic cues that allow freelancers to take mental shortcuts, which makes them more likely to bid ([37]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However, if the calls for bids appear too concrete or too intense, the task might appear narrow, which reduces the appeal of performing the gig ([37]). [80] finds that greater vagueness (i.e., less concreteness) can enhance judgments of a speaker's character, message acceptance, and recall. Moreover, some research asserts that reducing uncertainty with more concrete formulations is ineffective ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref134" title="9">9</a>]; [18]), so managers instead should embrace strategic ambiguity to allow for interpretative freedom ([43]). In contracts, unexpected specificity even increases ex ante costs ([58]). Contrastingly, greater task ambiguity can lower costs as well as reduce the risk of litigation and enhance cooperation in B2B exchanges ([81]). Greater degrees of concrete terms in communications with investors also can have adverse effects ([64]), and excessive degrees of positive affective words diminish the impact of customer reviews ([52]). Thus, we predict a stylistic trade-off: Overly ambiguous calls for bids, lacking any concreteness or affective intensity, may undercut buyers' success in attracting freelancers, but some degree of ambiguity (i.e., avoiding overly concrete, affectively intense communication) can allow for divergent interpretations to coexist. Thus, moderate degrees of concreteness and affective intensity may be most effective in encouraging freelancers to bid.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> P2: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Extremely sparse and extremely dense degrees of (a) concreteness and (b) affective intensity in calls for bids yield fewer freelance bids than moderate degrees.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259282-11"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-11" title="Managing Buyers&#39; Uncertainty in Bids">Managing Buyers' Uncertainty in Bids</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Buyers also face uncertainty when deciding whom to hire and how much to pay ([<a id="bib2up

By managing these uncertainties through their bids, freelancers can affect their chances of winning bids and their price premiums.

Specifically, calls for bids can reveal buyers' expectations and preferences for communication behaviors. For example, buyers might like to get to know freelancers, or they may prefer to keep their business relationships impersonal. The extent to which they disclose their own personal information in calls for bids should signal these preferences. An ambiguous bid offered in response to an ambiguous call for bids might lead the buyer to conclude that the freelancer is tactful, sensitive, and noncoercive ([10]). Adaptive communications also raise perceptions of credibility, common social identity, approval, and trust ([52]; [75]), as well as similarity perceptions, all of which in turn reduce uncertainty ([<a id="bib6up

Crafting responses that mimic the buyer's communication is a common personal selling recommendation ([78]).

Even in studies that note the performance benefits of adaption, researchers highlight the importance of the degree of adaptivity (e.g., the degree to which salesperson behaviors adjust for each customer during interactions; [78]). Similarly, studies of communication accommodation investigate the degree of accommodation used ([75]). Extending these insights, the outcomes of adaptation likely depend on communication levels (e.g., very informative vs. not informative).

However, we know of no studies that consider price premium implications of communicative trade-offs between reducing buyers' uncertainty and adapting to buyers' communication. In addition, we are not aware of any research that considers the possible negative effects when sellers mimic buyers who provide less task and personal information, are less concrete, or sparsely use affective intensity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Buyers who want to transact with high certainty might render a price premium to freelancers who reduce uncertainty by providing greater degrees of relevant information in a more concrete and intense manner. But if buyers perceive that the provision of relevant information, degree of concreteness, and level of intensity surpasses their own reasonable level, they might feel overloaded or restricted and thus unwilling to pay a premium. We therefore predict that buyers offer a price premium to freelancers who provide degrees of relevant information, concreteness, and affective intensity at a level similar (but never too sparse) to their own communication, as only these bids help reduce buyers' exchange risks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> P4: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> When the degrees of (a) task and (b) personal information, (c) concreteness, and (d) affective intensity provided by the buyer are at least moderate (sparse), freelancers can increase (decrease) their chances of earning a price premium by mimicking the communication of the buyer.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1.

We mined each call for bids and bid, then summed word occurrences reflecting the new task dictionary. By dividing this sum by total words, we obtained a measure of the degree (ratio) of task information in each text. When people self-disclose personal information, they use singular, first-person pronouns. In line with previous research (e.g., [67]), we measured the degree of personal information as the ratio of first-person singular pronoun words (e.g., "I," "me") to the total words in each text. To determine the degree of communication concreteness, we mined each text for [11] list of generally known English lemmas that indicate whether a concept denoted by a term refers to a perceptible entity. Following their operationalization, we included all terms that received a rating of 3 or greater on their bipolar, five-point abstract-to-concrete rating scale.[<a id="bib6up

Second, as a reputation cue, we measured buyer experience as the number of projects a buyer had commissioned previously on the platform prior to posting the focal call for bids ([32]). Third, a higher payment offer may attract more freelancers ([36]), so we determined the payment offered by the buyer in U.S. dollars, multiplied by an undisclosed index for anonymity. We used a dummy for nondisclosed payments, but we replaced missing values with a grand mean to retain the observations. Fourth, we measured project duration, as longer projects attract more freelancers ([36]). A dummy variable indicated whether the project was slated to last more (<a id="bib1up

Fifth, more buyers demanding freelance services at the same time creates a relative shortage of freelancers ([36]). To account for an excess supply of freelancers, we calculated the sum of all active freelancers in the specific submarket of the call for bids and divided by the sum of all calls for bids posted around the same time (±31 days) in the same submarket. Sixth, the marketplace grew over time, so we included fixed effects for the year of the call for bids. Seventh, we included fixed effects for the seven submarkets, since submarkets that feature more complex projects have fewer qualified freelancers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Beyond these observed covariates, buyers' bid formulations might have varied by project characteristics unobservable to us. To the extent that these unobserved project characteristics influenced both the buyers' communication strategies and buyer outcomes, the estimated parameters might be biased. Therefore, we concatenated all service skill tags from the service profile of each freelancer who submitted a bid in response to a specific call. Then, to uncover the latent mixture of project types, we applied a latent Dirichlet allocation model to the project-specific skill tags (e.g., [<a id="bib7up

Table 2 contains the results of a main effects model and the full model, and Figure 1, Panels A–D, display the curvilinear effects from the full model. We have proposed that extremely sparse and extremely dense degrees of relevant information, concreteness, and affective intensity in calls for bids yield fewer freelance bids than moderate degrees of these communication elements. In line with our expectations, we find a positive linear effect (.152, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and negative squared effect for task information (−.026, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), as displayed in Figure 1, Panel A. Moderate levels of the use of task information (50%:.222, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) yield better results than sparse (10%: −.426, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and dense (90%: −.495, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) uses. Furthermore, we find a positive linear effect (.052, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and negative squared effect for concreteness (−.080, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) (Figure 1, Panel C). Moderate use (50%:.078, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) yields better results than sparse use (10%: −.092, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) or dense use (90%: −.251, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) of concreteness. Contrary to our expectations, we find a negative linear effect (−.190, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and a positive squared effect (.032, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) of personal information (Figure 1, Panel B). We also find a negative linear effect (−.084, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and a nonsignificant squared effect (.001, ns) of affective intensity (Figure 1, Panel D). Thus, it appears that any provision of personal information or greater use of affective intensity by the buyer is always ineffective. As a possible explanation, we note that in B2B online conversations, self-disclosure and emotions may be valued only after business relations have been established, not at the moment they form ([46]). Most of the exchanges in our data were between strangers, rather than being repeat exchanges, so it may be more appropriate for buyers to avoid personal details and appear rational rather than emotive.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 2.

These experienced buyers might have established relationships with specific freelancers, which reduces other freelancers' chances and causes them to refrain from bidding ([48]).</p><a id="AN0157259282-24"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-24" title="Predicting Freelancers&#39; Bid Success">Predicting Freelancers' Bid Success</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259282-25"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-25" title="Model-free evidence">Model-free evidence</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Bids that offer less personal information and greater task information, concreteness, and affective intensity are more successful in winning projects. Among bids that won, the mean-level comparisons indicate nonlinear effects of mimicry. That is, successful freelancers mimic buyers' use of task information, personal information, and concreteness closely. If a buyer uses very sparse or very dense degrees of these communication aspects, the winning freelancers deviate more, indicating a nonlinear impact of mimicry.

In particular, difference scores suggest that one party's communication increases at the same magnitude as the other's decreases. They also ignore the degree at which the relative mimicry occurs. As a preferable alternative, we use polynomial regression, which allows for simultaneous testing of similarity and dissimilarity effects on bid success, at different levels of freelancers' and buyers' uses of the four communication aspects. In their study of positive and negative emotional tone convergence, [24] also use polynomial regression to explore the nuanced effects of convergence in leader–follower relationships on leader–member exchange quality. A simple regression model that captures absolute deviation cannot simultaneously assess the degree of task information by the buyer and the potential nonlinear effects of task information mimicry by the freelancer. So, we performed a polynomial regression with response surface analyses for each communication aspect to capture the extent to which freelancers mimicked a prospective buyer's provision of relevant information and communication manner. We detail this polynomial modeling approach that led to Equation 4 and the calculation of all polynomial terms, using task information as an example, in Web Appendix E.</p><a id="AN0157259282-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-27" title="Econometric model and identification">Econometric model and identification</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We tested freelancers' trade-off between adding more uncertainty-reducing communication versus mimicking the buyer's communication in a polynomial regression model that included linear terms, quadratic terms, and interactions.

As in the buyer model, we controlled for word count, project payment, project duration, and excess supply of active freelancers. We also included fixed effects for years, submarkets, and latent project characteristics. We accounted for the number of projects the freelancer completed prior to submitting the focal bid as a reputation cue that might determine bid success ([32]). Freelancer rating is an average five-point satisfaction rating that a freelancer has received for all completed projects. To retain observations of unrated freelancers, we included a dummy for observations without star ratings and replaced the missing values with a grand mean rating.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Several additional controls relate to whether a bid is successful. First, following prior research, we assessed linguistic style matching, or the similarity between each bid and the respective call for bids, across nine function word categories ([52]). Second, we accounted for any previous relationship in which the freelancer had completed at least one project for the same buyer prior to the specific call for bids ([32]). Third, freelancers submit a bid price that may differ from the payment offered by the buyer, and a higher bid price may reduce the likelihood of bid success ([32]). In light of this, we measured each bid price as a ratio between the asking price and the average indexed bid price requested by all competing freelancers for the same call for bids. Fourth, the longer it takes freelancers to submit a bid, the lower their chances of success ([34]). So, we measured time-to-bid as the number of days between the posting of the call for bids and the bid submission. A dummy variable also indicates whether the bid was submitted late (<a id="bib1up

Fifth, competition for a specific call for bid should impact each bid's success chances, so we controlled for the number of bids for the same call ([34]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similar to buyers, freelancers make communication decisions strategically in anticipation of higher bid success or other, unobservable factors.

The surface-level tests along the plotted misfit line (Web Appendix K) display negative curvatures for task information (−.020, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), personal information (−.007, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), concreteness (−.011, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), and affective intensity (−.020, <em>p</em> &lt; .01). These results indicate that mimicking the buyer's communication increases bid success (see Web Appendix L for further clarification).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In line with our proposition, we qualify this effect for sparse degrees of task and personal information, concreteness, and affective intensity provided by the buyer in Web Appendix M. If we were to find positive slope coefficients at lower levels, it would suggest that freelancers can increase their chances of bid success by exceeding, rather than mimicking, the buyer's communication. This prediction holds for personal information (.020, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and concreteness (.024, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), according to the slopes at low levels of buyer communication. However, contrary to our expectations, we find negative effects for the slopes of task information (−.008, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and affective intensity (−.030, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) at low levels of buyer communication. Therefore, freelancers should always mimic the degree of task information and affective intensity provided by the buyer. For these two communication aspects, the tenets of communication accommodation theory ([75]) and adaptive selling ([78]) hold: mimicking the buyer is always better. To increase their chances of bid success further, freelancers also must keep their bids concise (−.021, <em>p</em> &lt; .01 for word count). Reputation cues (experience:.002, <em>p</em> &lt; .01; rating:.010, <em>p</em>&lt;.01) increase freelancers' chances of bid success, as do linguistic style matching (.051, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), previous business relations with the buyer (.078, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), lower bid prices (−.006, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), timely (cf. late) bid submissions (−.004, <em>p</em>&lt;.01), lack of competition (−.251, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), and reduced supply of freelancers (−.042, <em>p</em> &lt; .01).</p><a id="AN0157259282-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-29" title="Predicting Freelancers&#39; Price Premium">Predicting Freelancers' Price Premium</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259282-30"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-30" title="Model-free evidence">Model-free evidence</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Bids with significantly less affective intensity and significantly more task information, personal information, and concreteness achieve greater price premiums than an average bid (M = 14% discount). Moreover, 96% of freelancers completed projects without any price premium, indicating the prevalence of value traps. The bids that achieved price premiums mimicked those buyers that made moderate use of task information, concreteness, and affective intensity closely, yet they deviated from buyers that made very sparse or very dense use of them. For personal information, we find a distinctive, positive, linear relationship for mimicry.

Thus, our estimates may be biased by buyers' self-selection, in terms of which bid they chose and whether they disclosed payments. Therefore, we employed a two-stage selection model. In the first stage, we estimated a choice model, with the availability of the necessary data as a binary dependent variable (i.e., bid was won and payment was disclosed). Using this model, we computed the inverse Mills ratio to account for the potential selection bias (probit model in Web Appendix N) and included this correction term in the final model estimation. To identify second-stage parameters, there needed to be one term in the first-stage equation that was unrelated to the error term in the freelance price premium equation. We thus included the dummy that indicates if the bid was submitted late only in the first-stage equation because this term explained buyers' choice of the bid, but we did not expect it to be conceptually related with the eventual price premium. Thus, this term satisfied both relevance and exogeneity requirements. The updated equation of our multilevel model (ICC<sub>(<a id="bib1up

However, for personal information, we find a positive curvature (.003, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), which implies freelancers should always offer more personal information than the buyer. For these B2B services, the provider and the service are inseparable, which may lead buyers to place more value on personal information about freelancers, even if their own provision of personal details in the calls for bids is sparse.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If a buyer provides little relevant information or is less concrete (Web Appendix P), a positive slope would suggest that freelancers can increase their chances of earning a price premium by exceeding rather than mimicking the buyer. We find support for this prediction in the slope of personal information (.027, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) at low levels of buyer personal information. However, negative effects emerge from the slopes of task information (−.016, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) and affective intensity (−.012, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), and we find a nonsignificant effect for concreteness (.002, n.s.). Mimicking the buyer's task information and affective intensity is always better, which is in line with accommodation theory and adaptive selling ([75]; [78]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Freelancers also increase their price premiums by avoiding lengthy bids (−.014, <em>p</em> &lt; .01). Although platform reputation cues (experience and rating) can boost freelancers' chances of bid success, they do not determine the final price buyers pay. The skew in the ratings toward very high scores may limit their ability to help prospective buyers determine an appropriate price ([45]. Linguistic style matching (.023, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), a previous relationship with the prospective buyer (.056, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), submitting early in the bid process (.009, <em>p</em> &lt; .01), and reduced competition (−.015, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) all increase buyers' acceptance of a price premium.</p><a id="AN0157259282-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-33" title="General Discussion">General Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Across disciplines, substantial research has identified various success determinants in online freelance marketplaces (e.g., [36]; [77]).

Accordingly, we investigate how buyers' communication can attract freelance bids and how freelancers' communication can determine their bid success and price most effectively, and the results offer both theoretical and practical implications.</p><a id="AN0157259282-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-34" title="Theoretical Contributions">Theoretical Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, we advance research on how buyers' communication determines their ability to attract freelancers. Drawing on prior communication research, we identify communication principles that critically relate to receivers' uncertainty, such as relevant task and personal information and the relative concreteness and affective intensity with which this information is communicated ([<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref252" title="8">8</a>]; [27]). To entice more freelancers to bid, buyers should carefully formulate their calls for bids to keep them brief. Freelancers' information processing motivation, time, skills, and proficiency likely are limited, so buyers must choose their wording carefully and select from various effective communicative aspects. They can attract a larger pool of bids if they provide moderate degrees of task information in a moderately concrete manner. Offering too little of these features leaves freelancers with too much uncertainty, and dense information provision or being very concrete is too restrictive. If buyers provide greater degrees of personal information or express greater affective intensity in their calls for bids, it reduces the number of service offers they receive. This finding contrasts with uncertainty reduction theory ([<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref254" title="6">6</a>]) and B2B research that suggests self-disclosure strengthens buyer–seller cooperativeness ([41]). However, instead of ongoing B2B relationships, our study refers mostly to initial interactions between strangers (in 98% of cases, the freelancer had never worked for the prospective buyer). Evidence obtained from buyer–seller online chats similarly suggests that self-disclosure and emotive expressions are valued only in existing B2B relationships, not in new ones ([46]). Overall, we offer empirical support for communication theorists' suggestions that common communication principles can be purposefully flouted to achieve better conversation outcomes ([23]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, freelancers must keep their bids concise. They too face a trade-off between reducing the buyer's uncertainty and offering overly dense information. In line with research on communication accommodation ([75]) and adaptive selling ([78]), we show that freelancers can improve their bid success by mimicking the prospective buyer's communication. Adding to these research streams, we introduce a contingency perspective that reveals the efficacy of mimicry depends on the degree to which buyers use specific communication elements. In line with accommodation theory and adaptive selling, bid success always improves when freelancers mimic buyers' provision of task information and use of affective intensity. However, in line with uncertainty reduction theory ([<a id="bib6up

Rational buyer expectations should allow high-quality freelancers to charge price premiums ([70]), but the quality of freelance services is unobservable prior to purchase, and rational buyers might refuse to pay any price premium if they feel uncertain and suspect the freelancer may be hiding information ([16]). Therefore, to achieve premiums, freelancers should offer short, appropriately formulated bids. Buyers are more willing to pay a premium to freelancers who mimic their provision of task information, concreteness, and affective intensity, which is in line with communication accommodation theory ([75]) and adaptive selling research ([78]). However, similar to the findings for bid success, freelancers should offer more personal information than buyers, rather than mimicking buyers' provision of such information. In most service settings, a "bad" seller might provide a great product by chance; however, almost by definition, a bad freelancer produces bad service ([36]). This tight coupling between the freelancer and service quality represents a conceptual distinction in our study, which accordingly shows that buyers' willingness to pay a premium increases with more personal information issued by the freelancer.</p><a id="AN0157259282-35"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-35" title="Practical Implications">Practical Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our findings offer actionable insights for the millions of buyers and freelancers utilizing online freelance marketplaces, the collective value of which is predicted to reach $2.7 trillion by 2025 ([56]).

To attract freelancers, buyers should keep their calls for bids succinct. Beyond that recommendation, we offer several tips for formulating calls for bids in Table 5. In particular, a task description with a moderate amount of information helps freelancers anticipate the task without overloading them with details. Due to the relative anonymity of online freelance marketplaces, buyers might assume that freelancers will need to know who they are, but instead, we find that the less buyers describe themselves (to focus on describing the task), the better the outcomes. Relatable and imaginable (rather than abstract) descriptions of the project help freelancers grasp the requirements. However, being excessively concrete becomes prescriptive, which deters freelancers. Using emotion words makes the content of a call for bids relatively more intense. Such intensity can remove ambiguity and make opinions quickly accessible, but we find that calls for bids are more effective if they are formulated relatively impassively. Enthusiastic project descriptions seemingly might raise freelancers' suspicion that the project is too good to be true. Also, offering higher payment might attract a larger pool of freelance bids, as do long- rather than short-term gigs. Finally, more freelancers bid when there are fewer calls for bids in the subsector.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table&nbsp;5.

Existing online reputation systems provide some assistance, but they also create entry barriers to new freelancers who first must earn good overall ratings ([13]). Fortunately, winning gigs and achieving price premiums also depends on freelancers' communication. Table 5 includes advice to help freelancers formulate more successful bids and avoid the value trap. In line with the mantra of adaptive selling, the call for bids provides a starting point in which mimicking the buyer's task information and affective intensity increases freelancers' success—even if they provide few task details or seem very impassive. But freelancers should always offer personal information and be concrete. Even if a buyer does not provide personal information or the call is relatively abstract, freelancers' chances of success and obtaining price premiums increase if their bids contain more personal information and are at least somewhat concrete. The strongest predictor of bid success is a preexisting buyer relationship, so more broadly, freelancers should grow their buyer relations.</p><a id="AN0157259282-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259282-38" title="Limitations and Directions for Further Research">Limitations and Directions for Further Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In examining theoretically grounded communicative aspects, we offer novel insights into how to manage uncertainty in buyer–freelancer exchanges. Intriguingly, we find that communication approaches that do not aim to minimize uncertainty can be effective. Continued research should investigate this notion further and develop additional insights into the exchange implications of linguistic choices in B2B but also B2C and C2C communication on multisided platforms ([53]). For example, affiliative ([66]) or collaborative terms might affect uncertainty and influence exchanges as well. Arguably, the personal characteristics of buyers and freelancers (e.g., gender, education, experience), channel choices ([50]), different sources of uncertainty ([29]), perceived risks ([25]), and spatial distances between buyers and freelancers also might moderate the efficacy of communication aspects, so additional research should specify their influences. For example, if buyers lack the expertise to specify what they want, they might benefit from more ambiguous calls for bids ([38]). Perhaps buyers' communication or alternative factors that we cannot account for (e.g., underestimation of the amount of work required to fulfill the task) influence the final price they pay, too. Efforts to specify these additional effects also might address some of our more controversial findings, such as the evidence that the number of previously commissioned projects by a buyer relates negatively to the number of freelancers who bid. We posit that experienced buyers might prefer freelancers whom they have hired in the past ([48]). Buyers also might have incurred switching costs or supplier dependencies ([29]). Methodologically, we estimated all the models sequentially, as buyers' calls for bids and their success occur prior to freelancers' bids and their success. But an equilibrium approach that estimates these models simultaneously at the bid level could reflect an alternative way to think about the data structure. The concreteness word list we used ([11]) may also require further refinement to differentiate specific concreteness levels among the word set. Finally, the anonymity and speed of exchanges in online freelance marketplaces may make communication particularly important in this context. A comparative analysis of the influence of uncertainty management efforts across different B2B contexts beyond these marketplaces could offer interesting insights, especially if uncertainty avoidance is a central goal.</p><a id="AN0157259282-39"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0157259282-39" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Hari Sridhar</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  Online supplement:https:/doi.org/10.1177/00222429211030841</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  Task and personal information, concreteness, and affective intensity do not comprise an exhaustive list of all the lexical elements that might define relevant information content and manners of communication.

The purpose of quasi-experimental methods is, in the absence of experimental variation, to determine the presence of a causal relationship. First, the authors explore how to identify settings and data where it is interesting to understand whether an action causally affects a marketing outcome. Second, they outline how to structure an empirical strategy to identify a causal empirical relationship. The article details the application of various methods to identify how an action affects an outcome in marketing, including difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, propensity score matching, synthetic control, and selection bias correction. The authors emphasize the importance of clearly communicating the identifying assumptions underlying the assertion of causality. Last, they explain how exploring the behavioral mechanism—whether individual, organizational, or market level—can actually reinforce arguments of causality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: quasi-experiments; marketing methods; econometrics</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Quasi-experimental methods have been widely applied in marketing to explain changes in consumer behavior, firm behavior, and market-level outcomes. "Quasi-experiment" refers to the use of an experimental mode of analysis and interpretation to data sets where the data-generating process is not itself intentionally experimental ([23]). Instead, quasi-experimental research uses variation that occurs without experimental intervention but is nonetheless exogenous to the particular research setting. Work using quasi-experiments in marketing settings has used events such as weather, geographic boundaries, contract changes, shifts in firm policy, individual-level life changes, and regulatory changes to approximate a real experiment. In each case, an external shock creates a source of exogenous variation that the researcher uses to establish a causal relationship between the variation and the outcome of interest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Companies also use quasi-experimental methods to understand the consequences of key business actions. For example, [17] analyzed a quasi-experiment where eBay shut all the paid search advertising on Bing during a dispute with Microsoft but lost little traffic. These quasi-experimental results inspired a follow-up field experiment where eBay randomized suspension of its branded paid search advertising and found results consistent with the quasi-experiment. Reflecting the importance of such methods at firms, some companies provide causal inference training for their data scientists ([32]; [81]). The ability to make causal claims is highly valuable in academia and in practice. This article aims to help both marketing scholars and practitioners conduct and evaluate the credibility of quasi-experimental studies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Quasi-experimental research, as in much work in applied statistics, begins with the equation  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">y</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo><mi>ε</mi><mo>;</mo><mi>β</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></math>  . The focus is then on whether a change in a single covariate x in the vector of  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi></mrow></math>  can be demonstrated to cause a change in  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">y</mi></mrow></math>  . This focus often enables the exploration of foundational questions in marketing, because marketers often have data representing the actions of many individual consumers or clients and need to understand the causal relationship between a particular x and y to make decisions about whether and how much x to use.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A marketing article that successfully uses the quasi-experimental econometric approach considers the following nine topics, which are echoed in the structure of this article:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal"> Research Question: Do We Care Whether x Causes y?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Data Question: How Can Researchers Find Data with Quasi-Experimental Variation in x?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Identification Strategy: Does x Cause y to Change?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Empirical Analysis: How Can Researchers Estimate the Effect of x on y?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Challenges to Research Design: What if Variation in x Is Not Exogenous?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Robustness: How Robust Is the Effect of x on y?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Mechanism: Why Does x Cause y to Change?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> External Validity: How Generalizable Is the Effect of x on y?</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> Apologies: What Remains Unproven and What Are the Caveats?</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We start by explaining why quasi-experimental scholars may appear obsessed with identification, and how this influences the choice of research question and data setting. Quasi-experiments come in different shades, ranging from an almost completely random exogenous shock to where the treatment assignment is only partly random. We suggest different frameworks to accommodate various levels of evidence depending on the strength of the underlying identification argument. We then turn to the importance of understanding the underlying mechanism behind the causal result. Typically, this means showing that the effect is largest where theory would predict and is smallest where theory would predict a negligible effect. We also emphasize that researchers need to be clear about the external validity of their study and apologize for what remains unconvincing.</p><a id="AN0156073801-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-2" title="Why the Focus on Identification?">Why the Focus on Identification?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Why are quasi-experimental scholars seemingly obsessed with identification? Identification is defined by the challenge that "many different theoretical models and hence many different causal interpretations may be consistent with the same data" ([58], p. 47). However, effective decision making requires an understanding whether a measured relationship is indeed causal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One way to describe this issue is through the "potential outcomes approach" developed by Jerzy Neyman, Donald Rubin, and others ([86]).[<a id="bib5up

The identification problem occurs because a single individual i cannot both receive the treatment and not receive the treatment at the same time. Therefore, only one outcome is observed for each individual at any point in time. The unobserved outcome is called the "counterfactual." The unobservability of the counterfactual means that assumptions are required. The identification problem means that those who experience D, and those who do not, are different in unobserved ways.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Random assignment solves the inference problem, as the "unobserved ways" should not matter ex ante ([31]). [88], p. 13) explain that "if implemented correctly, random assignment creates two or more groups of units that are probabilistically similar to each other on the average." With enough people assigned randomly to one group or another, the only meaningful difference between the groups will be a result of the treatment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Therefore, random assignment is often called the gold standard of identification ([70], p. 8). [12], p. 11) emphasize that "the most credible and influential research designs use random assignment."

First, the researcher must explain where the variation they are calling exogenous comes from. This requires institutional knowledge and careful research into the setting. Second, the researcher needs to demonstrate that the relationship between the variation and the outcome of interest is very likely driven by the relationship between x and y and not by some other factor.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To achieve the second requirement, it is useful to think about defending the experiment in terms of the exclusion restriction. Although the term "exclusion restriction" is often used specifically for instrumental variables, it is also a useful concept for other quasi-experiments. The exclusion restriction states that the quasi-experiment only affects y because it affects x.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There are a variety of ways in which the exclusion restriction can fail, and so researchers look for exogenous variation in x that will have no direct effect on y. For example, [91] use wind speed as a quasi-experiment to provide an exogenous driver of posting to a user-generated content site about windsurfing. This allows them to understand the relationship between content creation and the creation of social ties. The argument for the exclusion restriction is that there is no other plausible way that wind could affect the creation of social ties except through content creation. As they mention in the paper, plausible challenges to this exclusion restriction are that windy days could affect friendship formation directly because users meet future online friends at windier surf locations. To address such challenges, the researchers present empirical data to suggest that the social ties that are being formed do not seem to reflect geography.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another example is [66], which examines the effect of delays in the early part of a banking technology adoption process on ultimate usage. Through a quasi-experiment that provides a source of exogenous variation in delays, they exploit the fact that Germany has a highly regulated system of public holidays and vacations that vary at the state level to prevent freeways from becoming overly congested. This leads to delays in technology adoption in that particular period to customers in one state, and not in others. The exclusion restriction is that there is no other reason that vacations or public holidays in the few days surrounding adoption would affect ultimate usage except through delaying the ability to navigate the security protocols required to sign up for the online banking service. One challenge for the exclusion restriction could be that individuals who sign up for a banking service around public holidays are somehow systematically different from others in terms of their laziness or motivation. To counter this challenge, the researchers present evidence that users are not different along any observable dimension.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The exclusion restriction can also fail because of spillovers between groups that receive the exogenous shock or treatment and those that do not. The assumption that treatment of unit i affects only the outcome of unit i is called the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) in the treatment literature ([10]; [61]). This is not a trivial assumption. For example, [<a id="bib5up

The authors use this dispute to identify which company was hurt the most in terms of site visits and purchases. The SUTVA requires a valid control group such that the Orbitz–American Airlines disputes have no spillover on that group. As a result, the authors chose not to use airfare- or hotel-booking websites as a control due to the possible spillovers from Orbitz to other websites where customers can purchase. Instead, the authors used consumers' search of Lonely Planet as the control, because Lonely Planet is a travel website that is rarely used for bookings. The underlying idea is that an exclusion restriction cannot hold if the fact that one group was treated may also affect the control group's behavior. The SUTVA is therefore part of an argument that researchers make about an appropriate exclusion restriction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Importantly, there is no formula for a convincing explanation and defense of the empirical identification strategy in quasi-experiments. Except in cases of random assignment, it is not possible to prove that the identifying assumption is right. Instead, the objective for the authors is to pursue projects only when they can convince themselves (and their readers) that the causal interpretation is more plausible than other possible explanations. It is impossible to prove the validity of a quasi-experiment, such as whether one set of U.S. states serves as a legitimate control group for another or whether the exclusion restriction holds in instrumental variables. The credibility of any quasi-experimental work therefore relies on the plausibility of the argument for causality rather than on any formal statistical test.</p><a id="AN0156073801-13"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-13" title="Empirical Analysis: How Can Researchers Estimate the Effect of x on y ?">Empirical Analysis: How Can Researchers Estimate the Effect of x on y ?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After establishing the identification assumption through the underlying framework of an exclusion restriction, the next step is to explore the data and conduct analysis that allows measurement of the effect of interest. This measured causal relationship is what has the potential to inform decision making. We discuss three different regression analysis frameworks using quasi-experiments: difference-in-differences (DID), regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables (IV). At the heart of all these strategies is a similar argument about the validity of the quasi-experiment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 2 outlines eight key steps in the three regression analysis frameworks. As pointed out by [54]) and others, the techniques are very similar in terms of the underlying econometric theory.

The three frameworks differ in the first four implementation steps. We discuss the first four steps for each of the three regression analysis frameworks and highlight the issues in common across the three analysis frameworks in the last four steps. We also emphasize that many excellent papers do not implement each step, and this description is not intended to lead to unproductive dogmatism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 2.

To check for such unobserved heterogeneity, [47]) examine the behavior of Europeans on non-European websites that are not covered by the European Privacy Directive to see if a similar shift in behavior can be observed, and they find evidence that changes in behavior are connected with the websites covered by the law, rather than the people taking the survey. The identification exclusion criterion is further validated by a mirror image of the falsification test by looking at residents of non–European Union (EU) countries who visited EU websites. When residents of non-EU countries visit EU websites, the ads are less effective in the postperiod. In contrast, when residents of these non-EU countries visit non-EU websites, there is no change in effectiveness before and after the EU regulation. Therefore, the results appear to be driven by what happens at EU websites rather than by a difference in how Europeans behave relative to non-Europeans.</p><a id="AN0156073801-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-16" title="Raw Data Exploration of Difference-in-Differences">Raw Data Exploration of Difference-in-Differences</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The second step is to explore the raw data. Before applying the DID framework, it is important to explore the raw data to assess whether the quasi-experiment appeared to have an effect. For example, when a treatment occurs in the middle of a time series, many papers use a graph that shows that before the treatment occurred, the treatment and control groups were on a similar trend and had similar values; then, after the treatment occurred, the trajectory of the treatment group diverged from the control group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Researchers should also assess whether their quasi-experimental setting meets the parallel trend assumption while exploring their raw data. This involves demonstrating that behaviors were similar in the period prior to the policy change across the treatment and control groups.

For example, [48] examine the impact of offline advertising restrictions on prices for keyword advertisements. The first difference is the keyword ad prices in states that have restrictions compared with states that do not. The second difference is the keywords that are affected by the restrictions compared with the keywords that are not.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For quasi-experimental analyses that do examine changes over time, another tweak is that quasi-experimental treatment can occur at different times, meaning that individuals are treated at different times and that the  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi><mspace width=".1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="normal">Treatment</mi></mrow></math>  variable can change with subscripts i and t. For example, [27] study how a book review posted on Amazon affects sales of that book on Amazon, compared with sales of that book at barnesandnoble.com. Different books are reviewed at different times. Therefore, the treatment here is the review a book receives, and the  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">After</mi><mspace width=".1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="normal">Treatment</mi></mrow></math>  period occurs at different times for different books. [14], [19], [21], [35]), [49], and [85] explore the effects of variation in treatment timing. The issue is that because a fixed-effects DID estimator is a weighted sum of the treatment effect in each group and at each period, even though the weights sum to one, negative weights may arise when there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the treatment effects over time. A related concern has been highlighted by [45], who emphasize the problems that occur when both the treatment effect and treatment variance vary across groups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This means that researchers should be cautious in summarizing time-varying treatment effects with a homogeneous treatment effect as in the two-way DID framework if there is a substantial timing dimension. To address these issues, researchers have proposed a variety of estimators that allow for a cleaner comparison between the treated group and the control group. Both [21] and [35]) propose new estimands to estimate treatment effects in the presence of heterogeneity across groups and over time.[<a id="bib7up

[56] argue that many marketing interventions are based on thresholds of real or expected consumer or firm behavior. For example, direct mail companies use the scoring policies for recency, frequency, monetary models. Consumers just above and just below the cutoff should be similar in many dimensions, and their outcomes can be compared to assess the impact of the different mailings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, government policies based on firm size can provide a useful identification strategy for marketing scholars. For example, requirements for firms to post calories, undertake layoffs, and provide benefits often depend on the number of employees or other measures of firm size. By comparing firms just above and just below the threshold, it is possible to assess the effect of the policies on firm behavior.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A regression discontinuity design implies that treatment is assigned depending on whether a continuous score  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">z</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></mrow></msub></math>  crosses a cutoff  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">¯</mo></mover></mrow></math>  .

In general, if a threshold is used as the source of the quasi-experiment, particular attention should be devoted to the source of the threshold and providing evidence that the threshold is essentially arbitrary and not likely to be linked to underlying discontinuities in behavior. Any discontinuity in the effect is assumed to be due to the treatment.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This assumption is not always innocuous. Consider a $50 cutoff for receiving a marketing incentive. If the firm promotes the threshold and consumers try to achieve it, then there might be a substantial difference between people who spend $49 and people who spend $51. Those who spend $49 are likely to be unresponsive to the incentive because they did not try to cross the threshold to get the incentive. In contrast, those with exactly $50 in spending might have selectively chosen to spend exactly enough to get an incentive that they planned to use. It is important to address the potential for such concerns directly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This is reflected in a debate in economics about the effect of thresholds for low birth weight on medical outcomes.

In a critique of this work, [15] show that the children placed just at the cutoff seem to have significantly worse outcomes than babies on either side of the cutoff. This is evidence against use of this discontinuity for identification. [15] state, "This may be a signal that poor-quality hospitals have relatively high propensities to round birth weights but is also consistent with manipulation of recorded birth weights by doctors, nurses, or parents to obtain favorable treatment for their children" (p. 2119).</p><a id="AN0156073801-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-20" title="Raw data exploration of regression discontinuity">Raw data exploration of regression discontinuity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Once the researcher has found a regression discontinuity setting, the first step is to explore whether the discontinuity is arbitrary and linked to discontinuities in any other variables.

They exploit the regression discontinuity design of the rounding rule that TripAdvisor uses to convert the average ratings of reviewers into the nearest half or full star (i.e., a rating of 3.74 is shown as 3.5 stars while a rating of 3.75 shown as 4 stars), building on work by [71]. The key identification argument is that the rounding mechanism creates discrete, random variations in <em>perceived</em> quality around the rounding threshold and is independent of a hotel's <em>true</em> quality.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A threat to the arbitrary discontinuity threshold would be that hotels manipulate their average ratings around the rounding thresholds. [59] argue that if there is upward manipulation of ratings, there would be relatively few firms with average ratings just below the thresholds and a clump of firms with average ratings just above the thresholds. They show instead that the density of average ratings is uniform, with neither bumps nor dips above or below the round thresholds. They provide additional empirical evidence that characteristics of the hotels do not differ systematically above or below the threshold. Neither do they observe discontinuities in other key variables such as hotel prices and the number of five-star reviews.</p><a id="AN0156073801-21"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-21" title="Analysis of regression discontinuity">Analysis of regression discontinuity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The equation used for regression discontinuity can be written for panel data as</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">y</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">it</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>β</mi><mspace width=".1em"></mspace><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">I</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">z</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">it</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo>≥</mo><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">¯</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>γ</mi><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">it</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>μ</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>τ</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>ε</mi><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">it</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo>.</mo></math> </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">(<a id="bib3up

In general, such decisions have often been rather ad hoc, but there is an emerging literature that can help guide the researcher into thinking about how to take a more conservative approach to selecting bandwidth given the data at hand ([25]). The researcher should also ensure that their results are not sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. As with other quasi-experimental methods, the validity of the method cannot be statistically proven.

This means that directly regressing the outcome of interest on the instrument (in one stage) will get the causal effect of interest, but it will not be properly scaled. The purpose of implementing two stages is to scale the treatment effect properly. There are many ways of operationalizing instrumental variables, and this can be a place for highly technical tools. We emphasize the simplest two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach, but the intuition behind the role of instrumental variables as an identification strategy remains regardless of functional form assumptions.

The distinction between the relationship of interest (  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>β</mi></math>  ) and the direct estimate from the quasi-experiment (  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>β</mi><mi>γ</mi></math>  ) means that it is sometimes harder to visualize how the quasi-experimental variation works in IVs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Transparent communication of IV analysis is difficult for three reasons. First, in contrast to the binary nature of the exogenous variation in DID and regression discontinuity, instruments are often continuous. This makes it more difficult to communicate the intuition for why the variation is exogenous to the potential for omitted variables or simultaneity. The ability to use continuous instruments (and multiple instruments) can also be seen as a strength of IV techniques. They enable a more flexible set of counterfactuals because there are more treatments observed and used in the analysis. For example, while a discrete quasi-experiment on retailer discounts would allow the researcher to compare the impact of a small set of retailer discounts on sales, a continuous instrument for the discounts might allow the researcher to compare a variety of smaller and larger discounts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, weak instruments are a challenge. Instrumental variables techniques are consistent but biased, and this bias can matter even in seemingly large samples ([92]). Weak instruments can lead to incorrect inference in which the bias of the weak instrument dominates the potential bias of the omitted variables.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Knowing the context and the institutional setting can be invaluable in identifying strong IVs. For example, [76] derived their instruments for brand taste and price from the authors' intimate knowledge of the regulation and food industry. There are also recent advances in econometric methods that allow for more accurate presentation of statistical significance when instruments are weak ([68]). As [11] point out, many of the challenges of weak instruments are magnified when authors use multiple instruments to deal with multiple sources of endogeneity. By contrast, a focus on a single endogenous variable with a single source of endogenous variation has attractive statistical properties as well as being more transparent to the reader.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, many researchers present IV results with different tests and with different norms.

Presenting the results separately also helps the reader understand the intuition behind the quasi-experiment underlying each instrument—whether the multiple instruments use different variation in increasing the exogenous shift in x. If there are multiple instruments, an overidentification test such as the Sargan–Hansen J can be performed to test whether all instruments are uncorrelated with the 2SLS residuals.[</span><a id="bib8up

This typically appears in the form of a regression table with several different specifications. For example, the first column might not include any controls beyond the fixed effects, and the next set of columns might add controls. The economic magnitude of the coefficients should be discussed, both with respect to changes in the covariate of interest and relative to the range and standard deviation of the covariate and dependent variable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A key issue in quasi-experimental analysis is correlated errors in observations, because the outcome is often observed at a finer level than the treatment. For example, the researcher might observe treatment and control groups for several advertising campaigns over a long time period. For each campaign, the researcher might have data on many individuals per campaign and many time periods per individual; however, the choices of the same individual in many time periods are likely to be correlated. [16] emphasized that failure to control for the correlation between these choices will lead to an overstatement of the effective degrees of freedom in the data, and therefore, standard errors will be biased downward. They suggest clustering standard errors by individual over time to address this issue and provide Monte Carlo evidence that clustering is likely to lead to robust inference.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Similarly, [38] emphasize that if individual responses to the same treatment are likely to be correlated, for example, because of close physical or social proximity, clustering standard errors by groups of individuals is a conservative and useful way to estimate standard errors. Researchers often need to decide on the size of the clusters. For example, in studying ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, is the correct unit the company such as General Mills, the brand such as Cheerios, or the sub-brand such as Honey Nut Cheerios? The answer depends on the data and research question. If the data are at a lower unit level (e.g., individuals) than a treatment that takes place at the firm level, cluster the standard errors at the level of the treatment. A useful perspective on this is provided by [<a id="bib2up

More recently, there has been evidence suggesting that it is undesirable to cluster on the variable that determines whether that observation is subject to the regression discontinuity design (e.g., age). The answer is often instead simply to reduce the bandwidth across which the regression discontinuity is studied ([65]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Clustered standard errors rely on consistency arguments and large samples. With a small number of clusters, alternative methods are needed, such as those developed by [22], [30], and [53]. For example, [43] investigate consumers' dynamic responses to price promotions in a retail setting that involved randomly assigning ten supermarkets into varying promotion depths. Given that treatment takes place at the store level while the observation is at the consumer level, each consumer's effective contribution to reducing standard error estimates is likely to be lower than in a setting where there is no correlation across observations. However, given the relatively small number of stores/clusters available in this setting, the authors implement the wild bootstrap procedure, as proposed by [22], to correct for downward bias potentially induced in small samples. However, [24] show that even this approach requires rather large assumptions.</p><a id="AN0156073801-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-26" title="Challenges to Research Design: What if Variation in x is not Exogenous?">Challenges to Research Design: What if Variation in x is not Exogenous?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A more general point is that quasi-experiments range in how plausible the exogenous variation underlying the paper is, ranging from cases where the allocation is almost completely random to less clear cases where a firm or consumer assignment to treatment or control is partly random and partly an endogenous choice. Perhaps the ideal thought experiment here is [101], whose treatment and control were a pair of kidneys from the same person. [101] finds that in the United States, even identical kidneys from the same donor are received differently depending on the observed number of rejections preceding the recipient in the queue. Most research settings are less favorable. In such settings, it is often useful to combine different approaches in the same paper. For example, [79] combines a DID strategy with counterfeit entry as the treatment with a convincing and high-powered instrument on government regulation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Still, there will be situations where a compelling exclusion restriction is lacking or the treatment–control allocation appears far from random.

The table emphasizes that researchers should be cautious about applying matching methods or correction for selection bias on the grounds that there are no plausible exclusion restrictions, because these methods still require the researcher to make an argument about an exclusion restriction. The technical details of matching methods or selection bias correction are different from the three methods described previously, but the idea is similar in nature.

Many published articles in marketing have used propensity score matching when comparability between the control and treatment groups is violated. An assumption of propensity score matching is that there are observable control variables capable of identifying the selection into treatment and control conditions. This is not a trivial assumption. It suggests that propensity score matching is only good if the exclusion restriction is met conditional on the variables in the match. Any matching procedure to make the control and treatment more similar in the observables can be seen as a flexible functional form with adding "control variables" to an analysis framework. Propensity score matching requires subject-matter knowledge regarding the role of covariates in the treatment assignment decision and whether the exclusion restriction is satisfied conditional on the covariates. Therefore, we caution against applying matching methods without convincing justification of exclusion restriction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is difficult to identify a standard procedure for propensity score matching. We refer to [61] as a good starting point. The general objective of propensity score matching is to estimate a score such that the distribution of all the observed variables and behaviors among the treated units is similar to that among the control units. In this discussion, we consider the set of treated units to be fixed a priori. Four steps are involved in the propensity-score-matching procedure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, choose a functional form of the propensity score. The basic strategy uses logistic regression to model the probability of receiving the treatment given a set of observables. Second, measure the distance and apply a matching algorithm. Several possible matching methods are available including, for example, nearest-neighbor matching based on the distance in the estimated propensity score or multiple matching using all controls within some distance from the treated unit. Third, assess the degree of overlap in the distribution of the linearized propensity score after matching. Researchers typically plot and compare the histogram-based estimate of the distribution of the linearized propensity score (logarithm odds ratio) for the treatment and control groups. To inspect the match quality, it is useful to show tables on the distribution of the estimated propensity scores and the mean values of some key variables for the treated and untreated over different propensity score intervals.[<a id="bib9up

First, the model for the propensity score may be misspecified. In that case, the balance in covariates conditional on the estimated propensity score may not hold, and the credibility of subsequent inferences may be compromised. This calls for a careful discussion on the role of covariates in the treatment assignment decision. Specifically, it is important to provide a discussion of whether the covariates can be considered exogenous to the treatment. Second, regardless of the number of observed covariates used, propensity score matching does not account for the potential selection on unobservables in treatment assignment. It is important to explain why controlling for observables will address concerns with the exclusion restriction or why unobservables are not an issue in treatment assignment.</p><a id="AN0156073801-28"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-28" title="Synthetic Control Methods">Synthetic Control Methods</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In some cases, even the closest match may not be close enough.

Two aspects make this setting different from the typical use of the propensity-score-matching method. First, matching is done over the pretreatment outcomes in each period rather than a number of covariates.

Put differently, if propensity scores or synthetic controls appear to work when the treatment and control group are not similar, it is important to explain why controlling for observables will address issues with the exclusion restriction. In many cases, such explanations are weak and the exclusion restriction is unlikely to hold. Recent work in economics emphasizes this by showing the benefits of combining a synthetic control method with a strong exclusion restriction ([13]).</p><a id="AN0156073801-29"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-29" title="Selection Bias Correction Method">Selection Bias Correction Method</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Many papers written in marketing involve a comparison of potentially different groups that reflect endogenous choices by companies or consumers where the allocation to the treatment condition is not fully random. For example, [46] assess if the introduction of the free mobile app in a business-to-business context increases sales revenues from buyers who adopted the app. In an ideal setting, the company could randomize the treatment, then observe sales from buyers who did not get the app and sales from buyers who did get it. However, this company's app was available to all buyers. Therefore, the buyers' app adoption is not random, and self-selection into the treatment (adoption) group needs to be addressed. Omitted variables that drive strategic app adoption could correlate with the sales from these buyers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When this happens, it is sometimes useful to estimate a Heckman selection model ([57]), which explicitly models selection into the treatment as a two-step process. As [100], p. 564) pointed out, the exclusion criterion is still key to the identification of the treatment effect of interest in the two-step estimation procedure. Without the exclusion criterion, the effect of the treatment is identified only due to the nonlinearity in the functional form (specifically through the inverse Mills ratio). This may lead to severe collinearity and imprecision in the standard errors. More importantly, without a strong and credible exclusion restriction, identification in this setting is driven by the assumed functional form.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In other words, although the Heckman correction will provide an estimate without an exclusion restriction, that estimate depends entirely on the assumption that the error structure is bivariate normal. When there is an argument for the exclusion restriction, a selection model is helpful. In the absence of the exclusion restriction, even if combined with other techniques such as propensity score matching, the results would be identified off the functional form assumption alone. Put differently, if one of the covariates in the correction equation satisfies the exclusion restriction, then it is the variation in that variable that identifies the control for selection. In contrast, if the covariates in the first step are all also in the second step, then it is only the assumed error structure that identifies the control for selection.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There are both similarities and differences between selection bias correction and instrumental variable approaches. There are also similarities with the control function approach in terms of the importance of functional form assumptions on the errors in the absence of an exclusion restriction. Control functions are not part of the standard quasi-experimental toolkit, so we do not provide a detailed discussion. The selection bias correction approach uses the instrument to control for the effect of unobservables, while the instrumental variable approach attempts to eliminate the threat of endogeneity by only leveraging the useful variation created by the instrument. Yet, the two approaches share the basic idea of using an exclusion criterion (or instrument). Ultimately, both rely on the ability to find an exclusion restriction that creates useful and exogenous variation. This is why we emphasize the importance of identification in quasi-experiments and caution against blindly applying a correction for selection bias without carefully thinking about the identification assumption and providing a justification for why the exclusion restriction holds. Selection bias correction approaches are therefore only useful for causal inference in the presence of a strong credible exclusion restriction.</p><a id="AN0156073801-30"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-30" title="Robustness: How Robust is the Effect of x on y ?">Robustness: How Robust is the Effect of x on y ?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The specific robustness checks chosen will depend on the exact context.

It requires the authors to think about the theoretical contribution of their research more carefully and helps make the argument for causal identification more convincing. Second, identifying mechanisms can help evaluate the benefits and negative consequences of the intervention and identify avenues for course correction, if needed. Third, understanding mechanisms allows for the possibility to extrapolate the findings to other contexts.

To illustrate how quasi-experiments can show process through mediation, we use [52] as an example. They investigate whether a variable compensation scheme increases salespeople's stress, resulting in emotional exhaustion and more sick days, and counteracts the sales benefits companies might expect from variable compensation schemes. In one of their empirical analyses, they use a natural experiment where a company dropped the variable compensation share from 80% to 20% in one of its business units. To test the health state as a possible mediator variable, they were able to measure sick days both before and after the change in the variable compensation share. In the country of study, sick days are strictly regulated by law and require certification by a physician (at the latest on the third day of the leave). Those who take more than three sick days in a given month are more likely to have substantial health problems. They measure the sick days counting after the third sick day in a month.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Combining the DID analysis with mediator analysis, [52] show that the direct effect of the treatment (drop in variable compensation share) on sales performance is significant and negative, and that the indirect effect of the treatment on sales performance via sick days is positive and significant. The mediator analysis suggests that a higher variable compensation share is associated with enhanced sales performance but also with more sick days, which, in turn, reduce the gains to sales performance.</p><a id="AN0156073801-39"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-39" title="Assessing the Mechanism Through Moderation Analysis">Assessing the Mechanism Through Moderation Analysis</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Heterogeneous treatment effects can be used to test behavioral mechanisms. In a quasi-experimental setting, mechanism checks via heterogeneous treatment effects, sometimes referred to as falsification checks, are not simply equal to identifying moderators. They involve identifying which groups would be affected by a certain mechanism that would display the causal effect of interest, and which other groups would not display the causal effect of interest by the proposed mechanism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moderation analysis therefore serves a broader purpose by providing an opportunity to help explore the behavioral mechanism. If the effect goes away when theory suggests it should, then this helps identify why it happens. If the effect is larger when theory suggests it should be, then this also helps identify the mechanism. A simple approach is to estimate the effect separately by whether an individual is a member of a group that theory suggests should experience a bigger effect. Formal testing of whether the difference is statistically significant requires a three-way interaction between x, the source of variation, and group membership.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There are many relevant examples in marketing of the use of moderation analyses to demonstrate a mechanism if there is a reason to believe the boundary of underlying process exists or the magnitude of the treatment effect varies by some observables. For example, after showing the European privacy regulation hurt online advertising, [47] ran a falsification check demonstrating that European consumers behaved like Americans when visiting American websites and that American consumers behaved like Europeans when visiting European websites. The paper then explored the mechanism and showed that the regulation especially hurt unobtrusive advertising and advertising on general interest websites, two situations where using data to target advertising is particularly valuable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, mechanism checks through mediator or moderation analyses are important because they distinguish the goal of the marketing scholar from the marketing practitioner. Marketing practitioners run experiments and analyze data to understand what they should do in the particular situation they are facing. Marketing scholars need to have a broader sense of applicability beyond the specific setting being studied. Mediation and moderation analyses provide an understanding of when a marketing action will and will not lead to the desired behavior. For this reason, marketing papers are more likely to be remembered for the evidence that is shown in support of a theory explaining why the result holds.</p><a id="AN0156073801-40"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0156073801-40" title="External Validity: How Generalizable is the Effect of x on y ?">External Validity: How Generalizable is the Effect of x on y ?</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The external validity discussion in a paper should recognize the assumptions required for the analysis to capture the ATE across the population of interest, rather than a more local effect that is an artifact of the data sample or the source of quasi-experimental variation. A key concept is the ATE across the entire population. This is the difference in outcomes that would occur by moving the entire population from the control group to the treatment group. However, in some cases, the ATE may not be particularly relevant, because it averages across the entire population and includes units that would never be eligible for treatment ([100], p. 604). For example, we would not want to include millionaires in computing the ATE of a job training program. To address this, the researcher could use the average treatment effect on the treated, which measures the expected effect of treatment for those who actually were in the treatment condition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">One reason why a research setting may fail to be externally valid is if the treated population is unrepresentative ([72]). A concern that will drive whether the treated population is unrepresentative is whether those affected could self-select into and out of the treatment. For example, [28] study a rule change by Google that allowed non–trademark holders to use trademarks in search advertising copy. They study the rule change's effect on user click behavior. In this case, many advertisers did not alter their advertising copy strategy, for a variety of reasons. These advertisers may be systematically different from the advertisers that did change their strategy. Because these advertisers were not forced to change their strategy, we will never know what would have happened if they did. When faced with such issues, it is best to spell out the potential for self-selection and discuss whether it makes the paper more or less relevant. In this case, it would be accurate to say that the researchers captured the effect of a loosening of trademark restrictions, because it is unlikely that a search engine would force its advertisers into using other advertisers' trademarks. However, it would not be accurate to claim that the researchers capture the broader effect of all advertisers using other advertisers' trademarks in their copy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The treated population may also be unrepresentative if the treatment impacts a subpopulation to change behavior, but not the main population of interest. This means that the measured effect is localized to that subpopulation, and it is referred to in the literature as the local average treatment effect (LATE). For example, in the context of regression discontinuity, the LATE is the average of the treatment effect over the individuals who would have been in the counterfactual condition if the discontinuity threshold were changed. A limitation of regression discontinuity is that the results directly apply only to populations around the threshold. For example, comparing the $49 spend with the $51 spend may be informative about the impact of the marketing incentive on consumers who spend around $50; however, consumers who typically spend a lot more or a lot less might be different. The idea of LATE also has implications for the interpretation of instrumental variables estimates, as any IV estimate is the LATE for the observations in the regression who experienced the kind of variation exploited by the instrument.[10]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">More broadly, as with other aspects of quasi-experimental research, the best practice regarding the external validity of results is to clearly lay out the assumptions and limitations. For example, [94] use a quasi-experiment and DID to examine the impact of advertising revenue on the type of content posted on Chinese blogs. While it might be tempting to interpret the results as suggestive of a broader impact of commercial interests on media, they are careful to emphasize the many differences between blogs and other media, between China and the rest of the world, and between the way the bloggers were compensated and other online advertising models. In this way, Sun and Zhu's article explicitly limits the temptation of the reader to extrapolate too much.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">An internally valid quasi-experimental estimate can have broader external validity when used to identify relationships such as elasticities and then to use a structural model to identify the counterfactual of interest. In these cases, under the assumption that the model is a useful representation of reality, quasi-experimental methods serve as a complement for, rather than a substitute to, structure. For example, [<a id="bib9up

They then use structural methods to estimate the implications for firm strategy. [42] use quasi-experimental variation in health insurance prices to identify price elasticity and then combine this measure with a structural model to estimate the welfare implications of adverse selection. [29] use quasi-experimental variation around set quotas to identify the relationship between commissions and sales, and then use this variation in a structural model to determine optimal compensation schemes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Overall, effective quasi-experimental research requires an understanding of the underlying assumptions behind any broad interpretation of quasi-experimental results.

First, marketing scholars need to be able to inform marketing practitioners—both managers and policy makers—about the causal effect to allow practitioners to make superior decisions. Second, the best quasi-experimental papers do not simply prove a causal effect but delve into the underlying mechanism, which is key to marketing scholarship's goal of generalizability. Third, such techniques become more important as the scope and span of marketing practice expands and there are new settings and more varied sources of data that allow their application.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The objective of a quasi-experimental research paper is to answer an interesting and important research question about a causal relationship and provide evidence suggesting the mechanism behind the relationship. The choice of method (DID, regression discontinuity, or instrumental variables) depends on the nature of the quasi-experiment. The framework we present focuses on understanding how exogenous variation helps uncover causal relationships and why specific actions affect behavior. Of course the details of the methods will evolve over time as new research appears. Because marketing scholars are often interested in providing generalizable insights about how marketing actions change the behavior of individual consumers, the quasi-experimental framework is particularly useful. Similarly, firms that want to use those insights benefit.

This can occur when products connect consumers to their physical (place), social (people), and historic (past) environment. The authors introduce the concept of groundedness to the literature and show that it increases consumer choice; happiness; and feelings of safety, strength, and stability. Following these consequential outcomes, the authors demonstrate how marketers can provide consumers with a feeling of groundedness through product designs, distribution channels, and marketing communications. They also show how marketers might segment the market using observable proxies for consumers' need for groundedness, such as high computer use, high socioeconomic status, or life changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, the findings show that groundedness is a powerful concept providing a comprehensive explanation for a variety of consumer trends, including the popularity of local, artisanal, and nostalgic products. It seems that in times of digitization, urbanization, and global challenges, the need to feel grounded has become particularly acute.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: connectedness; alienation; need to belong; groundedness; local; rootedness; terroir; traditional</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">—[47], p. 43).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Dual forces of digitization and globalization have made our social and work lives become increasingly virtual, fast-paced, and mobile, leaving many consumers feeling like trees with weak roots, at risk of being torn from the earth. In response, we observe consumers trying to (re)connect to place, people, and past—to get anchored. Against this backdrop, we propose and test an important driver of consumer behavior that has largely been overlooked in marketing literature: the feeling of groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We believe that many consumers have a need to feel grounded, which we define as a feeling of emotional rootedness. This feeling emanates from connections to one's physical, social, and historic environment and provides a sense of strength, safety, and stability. Although the concept has received scant attention in prior marketing, consumer behavior, and social psychology research, the feeling of groundedness appears to be a familiar one among lay consumers. For example, we might feel grounded when returning to our birthplace, sitting at our grandparents' kitchen table while enjoying a pie made with apples from their backyard tree and according to a recipe passed down for generations. Similarly, we may have experienced feeling grounded when shopping at the local farmers market or foraging a basket of mushrooms from a nearby forest.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We argue that there are at least three conceptually separable (but in practice often intertwined) sources of feelings of groundedness: connectedness to place, people, and/or past. Collectively, connections to place, people, and past engender feelings of groundedness by "rooting" us in our physical, social, and historic sphere. These connections may be established through many different objects, activities, and types of interactions. In this article, we focus on the role of products in providing customers with a connection to place, people, and past.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Indeed, numerous marketplace examples illustrate increasing consumer demand for products that presumably make them feel more connected and thus grounded: Spearheading a renaissance of artisan, indie, and craft production, for example, locally rooted (micro)breweries have gained substantial market share in recent years. In 2019, craft beer accounted for 13.6% of total beer volume sales—a number that had increased by 4% even as overall U.S. beer volume sales had decreased by 2% ([<a id="bib6up

Similarly, sales estimates of local food increased from US$6.1 billion in 2012 to US$8.7 billion in 2015 ([24]; [45]) and farmers markets—which afford a connection to the land and to the people behind the food—are on the rise. In 2014, there were 8,268 farmers markets across the United States: a growth of 180% since 2006 ([24]). Beyond the food industry, online marketplaces such as Etsy connect consumers to handcrafted products and to the craftspeople that sell them. Impressively, Etsy reported 81.9 million users and US$10.3 billion gross merchandise sales worldwide in 2020 ([10]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This trend in demand for local, personal, and traditional products is surprising when considered against the backdrop of globalization, digitization, and modern society's penchant for technology and innovation. Marketers have begun to capitalize on these shifts in demand—for example, by stocking and promoting local products, encouraging contact with the people who make the products, and highlighting traditional ingredients or production methods. We have recently also observed marketers referring to the concept of groundedness. The Austrian grocery chain BILLA ran a national advertising campaign in fall 2020 referring to the farmers behind their products as "The people who make us grounded" ("<em>Wer uns erdet</em>").</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In light of these trends, we contend that products can metaphorically connect us to place, people, and past, and thereby make us feel grounded. For brevity, we hereinafter refer to products that can make consumers feel grounded as "grounding products." We argue that the ability of products to provide a feeling of groundedness will make them more attractive to consumers. We further propose that feeling grounded may contribute to consumer well-being. Groundedness—understood as a feeling of deep-rootedness, having a strong foundation, and being securely anchored—gives consumers feelings of safety, strength, and stability as well as confidence that they can withstand adversity. As such, feelings of groundedness might provide consumers with a sense of happiness, thus adding to their overall well-being.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This work makes several contributions. First, it introduces the feeling of groundedness as a driver of consumer behavior and consumer welfare. Second, it provides an overarching theoretical explanation for a variety of major consumer trends, such as the desire for local, craft, and traditional products. Third, it highlights that consumers experience a feeling of groundedness when products connect consumers to their physical (place), social (people), and historic (past) environment. Fourth, the studies offer various actionable marketing implications for products aimed at helping consumers connect to place, people, and past.</p><a id="AN0157259281-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-2" title="Groundedness">Groundedness</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0157259281-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-3" title="Groundedness in the Literature">Groundedness in the Literature</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As a personal characteristic, to be "grounded" is a common concept in everyday parlance, easily found in any dictionary. In contrast to everyday parlance, we found groundedness to be a fairly novel and underresearched construct in the literature. There are few direct references to groundedness in the marketing, consumer behavior, or social psychology literature streams. The mentions we did find in other literature (e.g., psychotherapy, environmental or educational psychology) are relatively obscure, only loosely related, or speculative (for an overview of relevant research, see Web Appendix A). For example, educational psychologist [29] writes about "rootedness" and develops a measure of rootedness for college students. However, McAndrew's explanation of rootedness is limited to location. Similarly, environmental psychologists (e.g., [27]; [33]) have studied connectedness to nature, which is also a more limited construct. We found a more closely related conception of groundedness in a psychotherapy doctoral dissertation, where [31], pp. 82–83) describes rootedness in terms of "the personal, social, environmental, and economic anchoring that sees us through tough times. Within rootedness, there is a sense of togetherness, a combination of personal identity and group identity, past and present, and people and places."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In philosophy, [47], p. 43) points to the importance of being rooted. She notes:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A human being has roots by virtue of his real, active, and natural participation in the life of a community, which preserves in living shape certain particular treasures of the past and certain particular expectations of the future. This participation is a natural one, in the sense that it is automatically brought about by place, conditions of birth, profession, and social surroundings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[12] likewise writes about rootedness in terms of the need to establish roots and feel at home in the world, while [41] refers to a connection to the land as a source of well-being that is undermined by technological forces that separate people from their roots in nature.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In marketing, [42] examine rootedness in the context of community-supported agriculture (CSA), arguing that by connecting consumers to the land and producers, CSA membership may help consumers reconnect to their "material, historical, and spiritual roots" (p. 141).

This connection can be physical in the literal sense, as when working with actual, tangible objects that originate in the local environment, or when immersing in the natural environment itself. We find examples of such immersion in, and connection to, the natural sphere in the East Asian tradition of <em>shinrin yoku</em>, or forest bathing ([19]), and the Nordic cultures' idea of outdoor life (<em>Friluftsliv</em>), which, according to [15], p. 3), provides "a biological, social, aesthetic, spiritual and philosophical experience of closeness to a place, the landscape, and the more-than-human world; an experience most urban people today lack." In the same vein, connection to place may be experienced when directly drawing from the earth, as popularly pursued in urban gardening and farming. Indeed, one of [42], pp. 140–41) informants states, "That's what farming actually is [a connection to the earth].... You are working with the living world. It's the connection you give people to the farm." In addition to a physical connection, consumers can also connect to place in a more symbolic sense. They may do so, for example, by consuming locally produced goods, such as a beer from a nearby brewery. Establishing a connection to one's place to feel grounded may have become especially important as a consequence of migration and mobility. For example, a consumer who has recently been relocated to a certain town may particularly desire to consume products local to that town, thus enabling them to build a connection to that place.</p><a id="AN0157259281-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-6" title="Connection to people">Connection to people</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Feelings of groundedness can also arise from a connection to one's social environment. Just as the meaning of <em>terroir</em> also includes its human capital ([35]), the idea of a "place" that provides groundedness, such as home, is often strongly shaped by the people and community associated with that place.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the social psychology literature, the human need for connectedness or belongingness to other people ([<a id="bib4up

Both online and offline, consumers may obtain groundedness by buying directly from the producer. At a farmers market, consumers may buy eggs directly from the person who fed the chickens and collected their eggs. On Etsy, online shoppers can order a breakfast mug from the very person who designed and shaped the piece with their own hands; the shopper might even be able to communicate directly with that person and learn how they developed their passion for handicraft. Either way, this enables the customer to get "closer to the creator" ([39]). On the business side, many firms, big and small, try to facilitate connections between customers and the people behind their products: for example, featuring individual producers on the packaging, indicating the name and address of food suppliers, or communicating via the company's founder or chief executive officer ([14]).</p><a id="AN0157259281-7"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-7" title="Connection to past">Connection to past</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The human environment, or terroir, also includes a historical dimension ([35]).

The past provides a foundation of memories, traditions, and cultural values for individuals to be grounded in.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Examples from the marketing literature illustrate how consumption behavior establishes a connection to the past and begets feelings of groundedness. In [42], some respondent quotes suggest that community-supported farms provide not merely a connection with their local physical environment and the people around them but also a symbolic connection to past generations within one's own family (e.g., a connection to ancestors who were farmers). [44], who investigated Nordic consumers' food consumption motives, state that "in the end, it is the caring food-producer who can bring the ubiquitous brand consumption back to where we were before industrialism" (p. 230).

In the consumer product domain, we see a resurgence of historic brands such as Converse ([23]) and observe companies helping consumers get connected to, or grounded in, the past. For example, firms may purposefully manufacture according to traditional and artisanal methods, such as making things by hand ([13]), or return to using older, often more "natural" materials and ingredients.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Building on this conceptualization, our first prediction is as follows:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Products that connect consumers to place, people, and past provide consumers with the feeling of groundedness.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259281-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-8" title="How Groundedness Is Distinct from Related Constructs">How Groundedness Is Distinct from Related Constructs</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Products that connect consumers to place, people, and past frequently differ from other products in more aspects than their affordance of feelings of groundedness.

First, some constructs—such as product authenticity, product quality, or product uniqueness—are characteristics of products. They logically cannot cast doubt about the existence of groundedness, which is a feeling about the self.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, other alternative constructs could be classified not as characteristics of brands but as feelings about brands. For example, brand attachment is a feeling of connection to a brand. In some situations, feeling connected to a brand might be a consequence of a brand's relationship to a place, people, or the past that a consumer longs to feel a connection with. For example, a consumer may be more likely to feel attached to a wine brand from their own region (or to their favorite laptop brand, which may have nothing to do with feeling connected to place, people, or past). However, this feeling of brand attachment is not a feeling <em>about</em> the self. Thus, it cannot be the same as the feeling of groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A third category of constructs relates to connectedness but is focused on only one of the three sources. For example, nostalgia, as "a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past,"[<a id="bib6up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6_ref51" title="6">6</a>] is related to the past but not necessarily people or place. Likewise, these constructs might be alternative explanations for one of the antecedents of groundedness but not groundedness itself. In addition, nostalgia describes a state of longing or affection, but it does not stipulate that this longing has been satisfied by an actual connection to the past. Thus, nostalgia is conceptually more closely related to the <em>need</em> for groundedness than to actually feeling grounded.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, there are some constructs involving feelings about the self that might be driven by similar antecedents or generate similar consequences as the feeling of groundedness; these include feeling true to oneself (i.e., self-authenticity), a sense of belonging that does not involve a feeling of deep-rootedness, a sense of self-identity, and a general sense of meaning in life.

In particular, we suggest that feeling grounded provides consumers with a sense of strength, stability, safety, and confidence in one's ability to withstand adversity. As such, feelings of groundedness might provide consumers with a sense of happiness, thus adding to their well-being. We find conceptual support for these predictions in the descriptions of [31] and [42]. [31], p. 82) refers to rootedness as providing "a sense of balance, belonging, and fitting to one's place." Further specifying the elements of well-being afforded by groundedness, Ndi (p. 59) says that rootedness is "the ultimate feeling that provides stability, harmony, and happiness among people and their community," whereas a lack of rootedness leaves a person with a sense of meaninglessness, disconnectedness, emptiness, vulnerability, and unhappiness. Building on [41] work in biodynamics, [42], p. 140) also suggest that emotional connections to one's environment "are a primordial source of spiritual sustenance and a foundation of social and personal well-being and, conversely, that psychological and societal unrest are precipitated by technological forces that separate humanity from its roots in nature." Research on constructs related to groundedness also provides indirect, suggestive evidence for our proposition that groundedness increases consumers' well-being. [27], for example, find that connectedness to nature is positively correlated with subjective well-being.

Marketers can promote the location where the product is made or ingredients are sourced, engage in storytelling about the history of the brand, or introduce the people who produce the products ([14]; [46]). Marketers can design products in a local or traditional style; use local, ethnic, or traditional ingredients; or employ traditional production processes (e.g., in "indie" products). Marketers can also adjust their channels of distribution to help customers connect to place, people, and past. For example, farms and small producers can use farmers markets (vs. supermarkets) that connect consumers with place, people, and past. Retailers can employ traditional store designs or focus their assortments on more traditional products. We propose the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H4: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> Marketing-mix variables such as communication, product design, and channels of distribution can be designed to increase the feeling of groundedness.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259281-14"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-14" title="Consumer segmentation strategies">Consumer segmentation strategies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We expect that consumers differ in how important feelings of groundedness are to them. That is, the level of need for connection with place, people, and past, and thus, for groundedness, varies across consumers. We examine three reasons why the need for groundedness might be heightened in certain consumer segments. First, the need for groundedness should be particularly strong when consumers' life and work make it difficult to establish and maintain strong connections with place, people, and past. We suggest that living in large cities (which are often inhabited by people who did not grow up there, are characterized by social anonymity, and tend to showcase modernity) is a predictor of need for groundedness. With regard to work, we expect that performing mostly computerized work, confined to the limits of one's desktop, puts a distance between individuals and other people as well as the physical environment. We consequently argue that computerized work is associated with a stronger need for groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we propose that the need for groundedness is stronger when consumers' foundations are shaken or connections with place, people, and past are severed or under pressure. We expect this to have been the case, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a global event that indeed disrupted many people's lives. Accordingly, those who the pandemic had more strongly put in a state of flux should have experienced a higher need for groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we suggest that the need for groundedness will be more prominent for consumers whose more basic needs are satisfied. Respective proxies such as consumers' socioeconomic status (SES) should thus be correlated with their felt need for groundedness. We predict the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H5: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The feeling of groundedness is more important to consumers when their work and life do not provide a strong connection to place, people, and past; when life events shake their foundation; or when their basic needs are already sufficiently met.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259281-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-15" title="Overview of Studies">Overview of Studies</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">With a view to robustness and generalizability, we test our predictions in eight experiments and one consumer survey, based on a variety of samples and data collection techniques (students in behavioral labs at universities, online platforms, and professional market research panels, both in the United States and in Europe). For managerial usability, our study paradigms include both consequential outcome measures as well as marketing-relevant factors that can be manipulated or measured. Study 1 provides evidence that groundedness increases product attractiveness in real economic terms using an incentive-compatible measure of WTP. Studies 2a–c show that groundedness has explanatory value above and beyond alternative constructs. These studies also explore how a product's affordance of groundedness depends on the closeness of the consumer's connection to the provenance of the product or the producer of the product. Studies 3 and 4 provide concrete implications for marketing practice by manipulating product design and assortment, showing how demand for traditional versus innovative products is affected by consumers' current need for groundedness, and exploring proxies that might allow managers to assess said need. In Studies 5a and 5b we focus on psychological effects on consumers. Study 5a shows that groundedness has a positive effect on consumer happiness, whereas Study 5b examines the effect of a grounding product on one's feelings of strength, stability, and safety.</p><a id="AN0157259281-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-16" title="Study 1: Groundedness and Product Attractiveness">Study 1: Groundedness and Product Attractiveness</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Study 1 tests the effect of groundedness on product attractiveness (H<sub>2</sub>).

We separately tested the extent to which the two brands provide a connection to place, people, and past (see Web Appendix B). We also measured a moderator—importance of the product category to the consumer—to provide further insight into the process and strengthen internal validity (e.g., to alleviate any concerns about demand effects).

In addition, Study 1 shows that the effect is moderated by the importance of the product category. The pattern of moderated mediation, where the indie versus industrial nature of the brand is less important to feelings of groundedness when the product is less important to the consumer's identity, provides further evidence for our process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A limitation of Study 1 is that indie versus industrial products may differ in more aspects than their ability to provide a feeling of groundedness. For example, an indie brand might provide higher value to consumers by being perceived as more authentic ([32]) and more unique ([25]) than an industrial brand. Further, the description of the indie brand and its production method might give consumers a greater sense of love ([13]), human contact ([38]), attachment ([43]), brand experience ([<a id="bib5up

Or the indie brand might simply be higher quality and costlier to produce. Our mediation and moderated mediation provide initial evidence for the proposed groundedness process, suggesting that these alternative processes are not the only drivers of the effects on WTP.

We then varied between-subjects whether the market's Christmas trees originated from the state the participant grew up in or from a randomly selected other Austrian state. The trees were thus not connected to participants' current place (i.e., where they were studying and buying the tree) but to either the place where they grew up or a third location in Austria. Then, we assessed purchase intent for the Christmas tree using four items (e.g., "I would very much like to buy a Christmas tree at this market"). We next captured feelings of groundedness from purchasing a Christmas tree at that market, using the same three items as in Study 2a. Finally, participants completed two-item measures of alternative constructs (the product's authenticity, uniqueness, quality, love, production costs, sense of human contact, brand experience, feeling of belonging to a brand community, and attachment). In addition, we measured participants' desire to support the producer as a possible alternative explanation. Due to this study's use of multiple items for each construct, we were able to ascertain that groundedness is empirically distinct from the other constructs captured (purchase intent and alternative constructs) using the [11] criterion.

One pertinent question is how much that feeling of groundedness depends on the closeness of the connection to place, people, and past. While the more grounding option in Studies 2a and 2b connects customers to their own ("my") current or past place, the indie brand utilized in Study 1 merely provided a connection to "a" place (and "the" people who made it and "the" past, respectively). Our view is that, ceteris paribus, the depth of groundedness gradually increases with the closeness of the connection. The closer the personal relationship of the customer to the place, people, and past represented by the product, the stronger the connection and thus feelings of groundedness established via the product.

As for different routes to groundedness, the study shows that a product's people dimension alone (e.g., its producer) can boost groundedness via a stronger perceived connection to people established by the product. Managerially, the findings are important because marketers can choose the extent to which they highlight the closeness or similarity between customers and producers.

A moderated mediation analysis ([20], Model 58; see Web Appendix D) shows that traditional design affords a stronger feeling of groundedness, and that groundedness becomes a more important driver of preference as general need to connect to the past increases. In fact, at very low levels of general need to connect to the past, a product's ability to provide feelings of groundedness no longer significantly impacts product preference (e.g., at need to connect to the past = 1, conditional effect = .33, CI<sub>95%</sub>: [−.05,.71]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, Study 3a shows that by varying a marketing-mix element (product design) to be more traditional (vs. modern), marketers can affect customer preference via feelings of groundedness.

We expected a positive relationship between desktop work and need for groundedness, because a disproportionate amount of computerized work (while confined to one's desktop) separates individuals from other people as well as the physical environment. A similar logic might apply to people whose job is characterized as "work of the head" (i.e., work that contains many abstract tasks), as opposed to people who perform manual labor ("work of the hands") or work in social jobs ("work of the heart"; [17]). Respondents accordingly indicated which of these three categories their current or most recent job fell into.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, to assess a potential link between need for groundedness and a disruptive major life event, we examined perceived impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the consumer's life. We assessed this with a single item ("Due to the current Corona [COVID-19] crisis, I feel that my life is in a state of major change"). Last, we theorized that the need for groundedness should become more prominent when basic needs such as food and shelter are not a concern. Therefore, we tested whether higher SES (measured on a three-item scale [e.g., "I have enough money to buy things I want"]) might be an effective proxy for one's need for groundedness. No other measures were taken.</p><a id="AN0157259281-38"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-38" title="Results and Discussion">Results and Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">First, and as expected, we find a significant and positive correlation between one's need for groundedness and purchase intent for products connecting to place, people, and past (r = .57, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).

We conclude that the "work of the head/heart/hands" measure was probably too rough and thus unable to adequately detect the important nuances in job characteristics that affect the need for groundedness. We were also surprised that one's living environment did not emerge as a significant predictor for need for groundedness in the multivariate OLS model. A closer look at the data reveals, however, that a disproportionately large number (29.2%) of respondents in our sample indicated living in big cities (i.e., chose the endpoint of the scale). When dichotomizing the measure (i.e., living in big city vs. not), we find the predicted positive effect: people living in a big city have a heightened need for groundedness (see Web Appendix E).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, Study 4 finds that a higher need for groundedness is apparent in consumer profiles characterized by larger societal trends: living in big cities (urbanization), doing desktop work at the computer (digitization), and undergoing major change (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic).

[47], p. 43) proposes that "every human being needs to have multiple roots. It is necessary for him to draw well-nigh the whole of his moral, intellectual, and spiritual life by way of the environment of which he forms a natural part." Our work indeed shows that groundedness is related to happiness and a sense of strength, stability, and safety; thus, we propose groundedness as a novel antecedent of these outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also theorized about three sources of feelings of groundedness: connections to place, people, and past. Although the three sources are often empirically intertwined, we show that they are theoretically distinct and powerful in fueling consumers' feelings of groundedness. Our analysis further provides rich insight on the nature of these connections by showing that the extent to which products provide feelings of groundedness is a graded function of closeness. That is, a product provides stronger feelings of groundedness when the product's place, people, or past is closer to the consumer. Finally, by identifying the role of groundedness and its sources, we offer an overarching theoretical explanation for major current consumer trends, such as buying local products (connected to place), produced by people we relate to (connected to people), and according to traditional production methods (connected to the past).</p><a id="AN0157259281-48"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-48" title="Marketing Implications">Marketing Implications</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Feelings of groundedness are worthy of managers' attention because these feelings have important downstream consequences as shown across our studies. In particular, feelings of groundedness impact consumers' brand preference and WTP. In Study 1, for example, consumers were willing to pay a price premium of about 60% for the product that provided more groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our work also provides actionable implications for product and brand management: we give concrete approaches regarding how firms can elicit groundedness by showing consumers their product's connection to place, people, and past. For example, our results in Studies 1, 2a, and 2b show how presenting a product as artisanal or highlighting the local origin of a product can provide feelings of groundedness. In Studies 3a and 3b, we have shown that managers can utilize other marketing-mix elements such as product design or retail assortment and configure them (e.g., as more traditional instead of modern) to provide a stronger connection to the past. Similarly, Study 5a shows that a marketer's choice of distribution channel (e.g., farmers market) has an impact on feelings of groundedness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of customer targeting, we have pointed out when and for whom groundedness is more important. In particular, we have shown that traditional (vs. innovative) products benefit from situational differences in the need for groundedness (Study 3b). On the level of individual differences, in Study 3a, only consumers with a high chronic need to connect to the past preferred the more traditional cutlery design. Our representative survey (Study 4) further showed a higher need for groundedness among consumers who are particularly affected by large global trends or major disruptive events. These global trends (e.g., digitization, urbanization) and major life events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) make it harder for consumers to feel connected to people, place, and past. From a groundedness perspective, it is not surprising that during the safety- and stability-threatening COVID-19 pandemic, customers returned to the familiar grocery brands consumed with their families while growing up ([<a id="bib7up

There are probably multiple drivers for this behavior, but it is likely that consumers chose these products, at least in part, because of the connections to place, people, and past—and thus feeling of groundedness—they provide.</p><a id="AN0157259281-49"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-49" title="Limitations and Future Research">Limitations and Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This is the first series of experimental studies investigating feelings of groundedness. As such, many questions remain for future research. With regard to antecedents, for example, we have focused on products as means for consumers to experience feelings of groundedness. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there are other ways for consumers to feel more connected to place, people, and past and, consequently, more grounded: for example, through services such as genealogy websites, cooking classes, lectures on local history, or yoga and meditation classes providing "grounding" exercises.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The scope of Study 4 has allowed us to identify an initial set of indicators for who has a higher need for groundedness and why, but it is clear there will be additional consumer characteristics and lifestyle variables helpful to marketers in identifying relevant customer segments. For example, people who travel frequently for work and have little chance to connect to their current physical environment may seize opportunities to (re)-connect to place—such as through a local craft beer—to feel more grounded. Likewise, pandemics such as COVID-19 are not the only type of events that can shake a person's foundation. Stressful life events such as separation or loss, starting a new job, or moving homes may cause a higher need to feel grounded. Similarly, the need for groundedness may be subject to seasonal variations. Preliminary insights from our own qualitative explorations suggest that individuals' need for groundedness may be particularly high during the holiday season and other festive occasions, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, Ramadan, and one's own birthday. Apart from that, interestingly, the need for groundedness appears to be higher during the colder seasons. We believe a more thorough testing of these hypotheses seems promising and would likely have important implications. If the initial signals are correct, for example, studies of scanner or panel data should reveal variations in the demand for products that connect to place, people, and past across the year.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we have only begun to examine boundary conditions. For example, it seems possible that in some situations strong roots not only provide strength and stability but could also constrain movement, thus giving consumers the feeling of being "stuck" and unable to escape their roots. Imagine growing up on a farm, surrounded by one's family, and doing things day after day in the same way they have traditionally been done by previous generations. A person in this situation will likely feel grounded but might also feel more motivated to break free, move away, or challenge the status quo. If such is the case, too much groundedness might even backfire. Future research might thus enrich the present investigation by focusing on potential downsides of groundedness.</p><a id="AN0157259281-50"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259281-50" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This research introduced feelings of groundedness as a relevant construct for marketing research and consumer behavior. We have demonstrated its importance to marketers by documenting that it increases product attractiveness and that it can be manipulated through a variety of marketing-mix strategies and used for targeting consumer segments prone to a lack of groundedness. We also have shown that groundedness is important to consumer well-being, pointing to important consumer welfare and policy implications. We expect that the importance of this topic to consumers and marketers will only increase as digitization, urbanization, and global migration continue to challenge consumers' connections to place, people, and past.</p><a id="AN0157259281-51"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0157259281-51" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Dhruv Grewal</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: We are grateful for funding from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Science, and Research through the HRSM scheme.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  Online supplement:https://doi.org/10.1177/00222429211027469</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  See, for example, https://<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grounded">www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grounded</a> and https://<a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/grounded">www.yourdictionary.com/grounded</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib6"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6up" id="bib_upbib6" title="6">6</a>  See https://<a href="http://www.lexico.com/definition/nostalgia">www.lexico.com/definition/nostalgia</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib7"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7up" id="bib_upbib7" title="7">7</a>  See [30] for a discussion of the effectiveness this type of experimental design and, for example, [8], [18], and [32] for examples of its use.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib8"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8up" id="bib_upbib8" title="8">8</a>  We captured a total of six different items to measure feelings of groundedness in this study but shortened the scale to align with the three-item measure used in the other studies.

Others suggest that in M&amp;A contexts, a dual emphasis of customer satisfaction and firm efficiency is both likely and beneficial. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that M&amp;As not only do not yield a dual emphasis but also cause a decline in customer satisfaction to the extent that they eclipse any gain in firm value from an increase in firm efficiency. A quasiexperimental difference-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variable panel regression provide robust evidence for the dark side of M&amp;As for customers. The authors use the attention-based view of the firm to demonstrate that post-M&amp;A customer dissatisfaction occurs because of a shift in executive attention away from customers and toward financial issues. In line with the related upper echelons theory, they find that marketing representation on a firm's board of directors helps maintain executive attention on customers, which mitigates the dysfunctional effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction.

Yet, many M&amp;As fail to generate positive results ([57]; [61]). Although prior research has explained the underperformance of M&amp;As with deal- and firm-related factors, the role of customer reactions has largely been neglected. This is alarming given that customer growth is a key motivation for M&amp;As ([18]) and customers are directly impacted by M&amp;A-based changes to product lines, brands, prices, innovation, and frontline employees.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The sheer enormity of M&amp;A activity (e.g., more than 48,000 deals with a value of $3.7 trillion were transacted globally in 2019, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, M&amp;A activity declined by only 3% in 2020) suggests that M&amp;As must be rewarding; otherwise, firms would not engage in them. M&amp;As allow firms to reduce prices ([20]) and innovate ([53]), both of which should satisfy customers. Further, M&amp;As enable firms to become more efficient through improvements in scale, scope, and cost savings ([16]; [37]). As a result, M&amp;As are posited to enable a "dual emphasis" in which firms achieve both customer satisfaction and firm efficiency ([62]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While the link between M&amp;As and firm efficiency is more straightforward, research has not systematically examined the effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction. Experimental ([64]) and anecdotal ([65]) evidence suggests that M&amp;As may in fact harm customers. Thus, we question whether M&amp;As actually enable a dual emphasis of firm efficiency and customer satisfaction. Instead, we argue that although M&amp;As might generate firm efficiency, they upset customers considerably, which, in turn, will lower firm value to an extent that any gain in efficiency will be outweighed. We theorize that this is because M&amp;As cause executives to pay more attention to financial issues than to customer ones, which will dissatisfy customers. We contend that marketing representation on the board (MROB) of directors will direct executive attention toward customers during an M&amp;A, which will then lessen a decline in customer satisfaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To test our expectation that there is a tension between M&amp;A activity and firm value via competing processes of lower customer satisfaction and higher firm efficiency, we collected data on a panel of firms from 1995 to 2017 from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) database.

We find strong evidence for a negative M&amp;A–customer satisfaction relationship, which persists for two years post-M&amp;A. Finally, we content-analyzed letters to shareholders to measure executive attention and collected data on MROB. Our instrumental variable panel moderated-mediation analysis provides support for a mediating role of executive attention to customers (vs. finance) and a positive moderating role of MROB.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We contribute to the literature in multiple ways. First, previous research has focused on the effect of M&amp;As on investor returns (e.g., [23]; [44]) and has largely overlooked customer reactions. In fact, a meta-analytic review of 25 years of customer satisfaction research does not report a single result with M&amp;A activity as a driver ([50]). The few studies that have focused on customers (e.g., [62]) have suggested that in M&amp;A contexts, a dual emphasis of customer satisfaction and firm efficiency is both likely and beneficial. In contrast, we demonstrate that M&amp;As not only do not yield a dual emphasis but also cause a decline in customer satisfaction to the extent that they surpass any gain in firm value from an increase in firm efficiency. Although researchers in finance have highlighted the negative ramifications of M&amp;As for acquirers (e.g., [<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref23" title="2">2</a>]; [36]), we are the first to empirically establish the negative ramifications of M&amp;As for customers, which we show lowers firm performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, we verify a negative M&amp;A–customer satisfaction relationship with a DID analysis with multiple control groups. As a result, we add to emerging research (e.g., [25]) on the use of observational inference to document the causal effects of strategic decisions. We also confirm this negative relationship with an instrument variable panel regression with a larger sample and a long-term analysis. Our multimethod approach offers future research a template with which to improve the reliability and validity of findings from secondary research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, to study M&amp;A outcomes, work in finance has relied on the efficient market theory, and work in marketing has relied on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Rather, in a novel direction, we draw on the attention-based view (ABV) of the firm to argue the impact of M&amp;A activity. Thus, we add to recent work on the marketing–finance interface (e.g., [19]) by showing that when faced with boundary-altering strategic decisions, executives tend to focus more on financial issues than on customer issues, which then indirectly lowers performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, marketing researchers have typically overlooked board of director composition, despite the fact that marketers on the board help shape a firm's strategic direction ([70]). We address this gap by complementing the ABV of the firm with the upper echelons theory to demonstrate that firms with (vs. without) marketers on their board of directors help channel executive attention to customers (vs. financial issues). This, in turn, helps minimize customers' post-M&amp;A dissatisfaction. Here, we identify marketing leadership's important role in the marketing–finance interface during disruptive strategic transformations such as M&amp;As. As a result, we are the first to incorporate marketing's role on the board into theories about M&amp;As and customer satisfaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In terms of our practical contributions, we caution executives against pursuing M&amp;As to gain efficiencies without considering how customers may be harmed. This is because the negative effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction lasts for at least two years. In particular, we show that during an M&amp;A, firms that pay greater attention to their customers relative to financial issues experience a 45% reduction in loss of firm value. As a solution, we recommend that firms have at least one marketer on their boards of directors to retain executive attention on customers, which translates into a gain in firm value of 4.28%.</p><a id="AN0155817137-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817137-2" title="Theoretical Background and Hypotheses">Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As we show in our literature review in Table 1, we distinguish our research from prior work in four important ways. First, although prior work has investigated the effect of M&amp;As on firm efficiency, we are the first to also consider the effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction to determine their overall effect on firm value. Second, we examine the effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction with multiple data structures and models across multiple industries and years to make causal inferences. Third, while previous research in finance has overwhelmingly relied on the efficient market hypothesis and those in marketing have relied on the RBV of the firm, we introduce the ABV of the firm to an M&amp;A context. Finally, those who have used upper echelons theory have overlooked the role of marketing leadership in managing M&amp;As and driving customer satisfaction. We address these gaps by proposing and demonstrating that MROB weakens the negative impact of M&amp;As on executive attention to customer (vs. financial) issues.

M&amp;As can expand firms' product portfolios to provide customers with a larger set of choices ([12]) and higher-quality products ([33]). This supports Swaminathan et al.'s (2014) assertion that M&amp;As are associated with higher customer satisfaction. In contrast, other research suggests that M&amp;As may dissatisfy customers. In particular, M&amp;As can result in price increases ([32]) and poor customer service ([60]). For example, the recent sale of DirecTV by AT&amp;T to the private equity firm TPG for a third of the acquired price in 2015 was largely attributed to the loss of dissatisfied customers postacquisition ([34]). Moreover, anecdotes from the ACSI reveal that even two years after M&amp;As, customers are less satisfied than they had been before ([<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref33" title="1">1</a>]). In particular, M&amp;As may cause customers to lose access to their favorite brands. A recent survey by PwC shows that as firms become larger after an M&amp;A, they tend to lose grip of their customers' feelings, and, as a result, customer experience suffers ([52]). This is detrimental because customer dissatisfaction lowers firm value and increases firm risk ([21]; [39]; [43]; [50]; [66]). Thus, we expect that M&amp;As will dissatisfy customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The strategy literature suggests that a primary motivation for firms to engage in M&amp;As is to gain efficiencies ([37]). M&amp;As increase firm efficiency by spreading ﬁxed costs over more output and eliminating redundancies ([12]). Specifically, M&amp;As result in economies of scale and scope, asset and employee rationalization, a reduction in transaction costs ([14]), and a reallocation of intangible assets ([45]). These extra resources allow firms to reallocate their savings to other valuable projects, which, in turn, increases firm value ([43]). Thus, consistent with prior research, we expect that M&amp;As will increase firm efficiency. This brings us to two competing outcomes of M&amp;A activity:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H1: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> M&amp;As are associated with (a) a decrease in customer satisfaction but (b) an increase in firm efficiency.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A logical follow-up question is, what is the total effect of M&amp;As on firm value given our opposing expectations of a decline in customer satisfaction but an increase firm efficiency? We expect that M&amp;As will cause a steeper drop in customer satisfaction than an increase in firm efficiency for the following reasons. First, M&amp;As often result in layoffs to reduce redundancies, which—while beneficial from an efficiency perspective—harms customer experience. The remaining employees that are not laid off are likely to be stressed ([11]), and stressed employees and their dissatisfaction with a major corporate shake-up negatively affect customers and the service they experience ([52]). Second, firms may either change or consolidate procedures such as credit policies, payment terms, and loyalty programs during an M&amp;A to minimize the complexity of managing two separate systems. While these actions may be efficient, customers are likely to see their hard-earned privileges curtailed or, in the extreme, taken away ([64]), which results in relationship uncertainty ([29]). In fact, customers defect even before they know exactly how an M&amp;A will affect them ([42]). Thus, customers who face poorer service and a loss of privileges will feel negatively about their relationship with a post-M&amp;A firm. Third, customer dissatisfaction attracts short sellers, whose trading hurts firm value ([39]). Thus, we expect that a decline in customer satisfaction will be larger than an increase in efficiency, and as a result, firm value will decline. We test this notion in our estimation.</p><a id="AN0155817137-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817137-4" title="M&amp;A Activity, Executive Attention, and Customer Satisfaction">M&amp;A Activity, Executive Attention, and Customer Satisfaction</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">So far, we have argued that although M&amp;As generate efficiencies, their negative impact on customer satisfaction is significant and noteworthy, yet underresearched. Next, we focus on the negative M&amp;A–customer satisfaction relationship and aim to uncover a mechanism that drives this relationship. The marketing literature has often adopted the RBV of the firm view to examine M&amp;A activity (Table 1). This research stream argues that a firm's ability to acquire and deploy marketing resources during an M&amp;A can strengthen performance. Although the RBV provides a valuable strategic lens with which to examine M&amp;A activity, another theoretical process may also be at play. We use the ABV to argue why M&amp;As lower customer satisfaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The ABV highlights the importance of executives' information-processing capacity and their distribution of attention. "Attention" refers to as a focus of time and effort with making sense of a firm's environment and how to respond to it ([48]). A key premise is that executives' attention is finite, so they are selective in what they notice and interpret. Further, how they respond to stimuli depends on what they notice and interpret in the first place. Thus, what executives pay attention to affects their resource allocation ([10]), which suggests that executives will invest resources in what they pay attention to at the expense of what they ignore. Further, attention drives executives to match their firms' resources with opportunities in their environment (Vadakeppatt et al. [67]; [72]). We draw on the ABV to argue that M&amp;A activity directs executives' attention away from customers and toward financial issues, which, in turn, reduces the extent of resources allocated toward satisfying customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">M&amp;As are incredibly expensive, complex, and heavily scrutinized by investors. As a result, executive attention is likely to be diverted to the price of the deals, capital requirements, paying back debt providers, and appeasing investors. In the process, customer experience might be underinvested in or even overlooked. In fact, managers know that there is a trade-off between serving customers and serving shareholders/debtholders such that creating value for one can detract from the other, and vice versa ([58]). For example, H.J. Heinz purchased Kraft Foods for nearly $36 billion in 2015. At the behest of investors, the merged company slashed $1.8 billion in overhead, which included a purge of nearly 2,500 jobs. Then, after Kraft Heinz's post-M&amp;A sales slowed,[<a id="bib6up

Firms clearly face considerable financial pressure after an M&amp;A, which can cause executives to focus on appeasing investors at the expense of customers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Further, M&amp;As are often paid for by corporate debt. Recent examples of extensive borrowing for M&amp;As include established companies such as CVS, IBM, Campbell's, Bayer, and Sherwin-Williams ([15]). Debt can turn executives' attention toward loan-servicing obligations, conserving cash rather than investing ([<a id="bib3up

Debt also limits investments in advertising ([27]) and product quality ([40]). Thus, executives at indebted M&amp;A firms may focus on satisfying debtholders over customers.

If executives pay more attention to, for example, innovation, then they allocate more resources toward innovation-related activities to drive success ([72]; [75]).

It is both a governance body and a strategic body that sets a firm's goals and advises executives on how to pursue these goals ([<a id="bib9up

While executives are responsible for formulating strategies given a set of objectives, they do not determine these objectives ([24]). Rather, such objectives, which include growth or cost cutting, are usually made at the board level. As a result, a board of directors is heavily involved in the M&amp;A process due to its transformative corporate consequences ([30]). A less researched, but critically important, type of board member is one who has a marketing title. Given their expertise in customer orientation, they provide marketing-related advice to other members on the board and the executive team, which ensures that firm strategies are customer-centric ([70]). We examine how MROB influences the relationship between M&amp;As and customer satisfaction through a shift in executive attention.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The upper echelons theory states that the characteristics of a ﬁrm's top leaders inﬂuence its strategic decisions and outcomes ([28]).

Given that financial issues dominate executives' attention during M&amp;As, we contend that marketers on the board will serve as "customer attention custodians" to channel resources toward addressing any challenges faced by customers. They will do so by diffusing a customer-focus throughout the organization to mobilize employees to proactively attend to customers that face a disruptive context. Given that firms perform poorly in areas in which their board members have limited expertise ([41]), if there is no MROB, then customer-related issues are likely to be ignored or possibly mismanaged by others ([<a id="bib9up

We contend that the functional role of a board member influences not only whether role-related resources are conferred to the rest of the board and the firm but also what the board member interprets in the environment and encourages others to pay attention to. In other words, we expect that during an M&amp;A, MROB will minimize a depletion of executive attention on customers and marketing-related issues.

Effect of M&amp;As on Firm Value">The Net Effect of M&amp;As on Firm Value</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given the asymmetric findings of a decline in customer satisfaction but an increase in firm efficiency from M&amp;A activity, we next focus on the net effect of M&amp;As on firm value through customer satisfaction and firm efficiency. From Table 3, we see that the positive association between customer satisfaction and firm value (Θ<sub>1</sub> = 2.214, <em>p</em> &lt; .01) is greater than the positive association between firm efficiency and firm value (Θ<sub>2 </sub>= .838, <em>p</em> &lt; .01). To calculate the net effect of M&amp;A activity on firm value via customer satisfaction and firm efficiency, we used the results from Equations 1.1 and 1.2. On average, the customer satisfaction of the M&amp;A firms was 1.14% lower than the non-M&amp;A firms (φ<sub>M&amp;A</sub> = φ1 + φ3 = −.0114 = −.0012 + −.0102) and the firm efficiency of the M&amp;A firms was.29% higher than the non-M&amp;A firms (β<sub>M&amp;A</sub> = β1 + β3 = .0029 = −.0668 + .0697). We multiplied the M&amp;A firms' customer satisfaction and firm efficiency elasticities for firm value from Equation 1.3 with the differences between the M&amp;A and non-M&amp;A firms in the post-M&amp;A year from Equations 1.1 and 1.2. Then, we summed the products and found a net effect of −.0243. Therefore, compared with non-M&amp;A firms, M&amp;A firms' value decreased by 2.43% one year after an M&amp;A, and as a result, the net-negative effect of M&amp;As on firm value is due to a decrease in customer satisfaction.</p><a id="AN0155817137-18"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817137-18" title="An In-Depth Analysis of the Negative Effect of M&amp;As on Customer Satisfaction">An In-Depth Analysis of the Negative Effect of M&amp;As on Customer Satisfaction</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Because we found that, despite gains in firm efficiency, M&amp;As decrease firm value due to a decline in customer satisfaction, we aimed to validate the latter effect more systematically with several approaches.

Second, we created a panel of firms without imposing restrictions on which firms to include (i.e., we included all of the firms from the ACSI database).

We also tested the equality of changes in the drivers of customer satisfaction two years before the M&amp;A through the M&amp;A year and did not find any differences between the two groups. Thus, any distinction in post-M&amp;A customer satisfaction between the two groups was not likely to be caused by firm-level differences, and the parallelness assumption was satisfied for the observable drivers of customer satisfaction. Next, we compared the two-year average customer satisfaction of the M&amp;A and non-M&amp;A groups before the M&amp;A (t<em> </em>= .54, <em>p</em> &gt; .10) and the equality of changes in customer satisfaction two years before the M&amp;A through the M&amp;A year to satisfy the parallelness assumption (t<em> </em>= 1.31, <em>p</em> &gt; .10) and did not find any significant differences (Table 4, Panel B).

Arguably, executive attention to customers (vs. finance) is endogenous because executives may strategically pay attention to issues that result in better outcomes, such as customer satisfaction. To address this, we used a latent instrumental variable approach ([31]; [35]). Specifically, we used a binary unobserved instrument to separate the observed endogenous predictor into correlated versus uncorrelated components with an error term in Equation 6.2 (for further details, see Web Appendix E).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It is also plausible that MROB is endogenous such that there are systematic differences between firms that appoint a marketer to their boards and those that do not. We estimated a firm's decision to have MROB ([70]) and used board-related variables (peer firm mean MROB, mean board age, chief marketing officer [CMO] on the top management team [TMT], mean board tenure, board size, chief executive officer [CEO] duality, and female percentage) as our exclusion restrictions. We estimated the following random-effects probit model to produce an MROB IMR to include in our main estimation (for the results of Equation 5, see Table E.1 in Web Appendix E):</p><p

M&amp;A firms experience a decline in executive attention to customers relative to financial issues. For example, from our sample we see that for United Airlines, executive attention to customers (vs. finance) declined 38% because of its acquisition of Continental Airlines and its customer satisfaction declined 8.2%.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 3. Executive attention to customer versus finance trends.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">When we compared a change in executive attention to customers (vs. finance) from two years before an M&amp;A with the year before, the difference between the M&amp;A and non-M&amp;A groups was not significant (t = 1.54, <em>p &gt; </em>.10). In contrast, when we compared a change from a year before the M&amp;A with the year after, the M&amp;A firms experienced a decline in executive attention to customers (vs. finance), whereas the non-M&amp;A firms experienced a slight increase (ΔM&amp;A Attention to Customers [vs. Finance]<sub>[t + 1, t − 1]</sub> = −.03; ΔNon-M&amp;A Attention to Customers [vs. Finance]<sub>[t + 1, t − 1]</sub> = .01, <em>p </em>&lt; .01). For the M&amp;A firms with MROB, they experienced an increase in executive attention to customers (vs. finance) from the year before an M&amp;A to the year after, whereas for those without MROB, they experienced a decrease (ΔM&amp;A with MROB Attention to Customers [vs. Finance]<sub>[t + 1, t − 1]</sub> = .01; ΔM&amp;A without MROB Attention to Customers [vs. Finance]<sub>[t + 1, t − 1]</sub> = −.04, <em>p &lt; </em>.05). Consistent with this trend is the fact that for one of our sample firms, Macy's, it engaged in M&amp;As in 2015 while having MROB. Macy's executive attention to customers (vs. financial issues) increased by 5.86% from the year before the M&amp;As to the year after. Not surprisingly, Macy's did not experience any decline in customer satisfaction during this period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We present the estimation results for executive attention to customers (vs. finance) (Model 1a) and customer satisfaction (CSAT; Model 1b) in Table 8. We find that M&amp;A activity is associated with lower executive attention to customers (vs. finance) (β<sub>3 </sub>= −.032, <em>p</em> &lt; .05, Model 1a) and executive attention to customers (vs. finance) is associated with higher customer satisfaction (π<sub>4</sub> = 1.423, <em>p </em>&lt; .01, Model 1b). Still, the effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction persists with the inclusion of the mediator, executive attention to customers (vs. finance) (π<sub>3</sub> = −.764, <em>p</em> &lt; .05, Model 1b), which suggests partial mediation. Its mediating impact persists when we incorporate the MROB interaction terms (Model 2b). Based on Model 2b, the indirect effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction through executive attention to customers (vs. finance) is negative and significant (β<sub>3</sub>[Post-M&amp;A Year and M&amp;A group] × π<sub>4</sub>[Executive attention to customers (vs. finance)] = −.046, confidence interval = [−.144, −.000]). Thus, in support of H<sub>2</sub>, customer dissatisfaction from M&amp;As is due, in part, to a shift in executive attention away from customers and toward financial issues.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 8.

Further, it has overlooked a key pathway between M&amp;A activity and firm value: customer satisfaction. Some empirical work (e.g., [62]) has examined the interplay between M&amp;A activity and customer satisfaction by treating customer satisfaction as a moderator and speculated (but not formally tested) that M&amp;As enable a dual emphasis of firm efficiency and customer satisfaction. In contrast, we show that M&amp;As not only do not enable a dual emphasis but also cause a decline in customer satisfaction to the extent that they outweigh any gain in firm value from firm efficiency. Thus, we add to previous work on firms' dual emphasis (e.g., [43]) but show that M&amp;A activity works against a dual emphasis of firm efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We examine heterogeneity in the decline in customer satisfaction with novel conceptual additions to the M&amp;A and customer satisfaction literature streams: executive attention to customers versus finance and MROB. We address ongoing calls to increase marketing's profile in the C-suite and higher (e.g., [24]; [46]; [70]) by examining how marketing leadership at the top of a firm redirects executive attention to customer issues, which explains differences in customer outcomes of M&amp;As. In doing so, we add to the limited research on marketing presence in the upper echelons (e.g., [<a id="bib9up

This view, which emphasizes capabilities, fails to consider executive attention ([75]); however, executive attention is a precursor to resource investments. Further, although the ABV considers executive attention, it has primarily focused on the effect of supply-side (vs. demand-side) factors that influence managerial attention (e.g., [48]; [75]). In contrast, we extend the ABV to study marketing strategy phenomena in general, and a crucial demand-side stakeholder—customers—in particular. This aligns with newer research (e.g., Vadakkepatt et al. 2021) that aligns this theory with customer outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We contribute work on the marketing–finance interface. We introduce executive attention to customers versus financial issues as a mediator of the relationship between firm strategy (M&amp;As) and a market-based asset (customer satisfaction). We find that during M&amp;As, executives focus on financial issues at the cost of customer issues but that MROB can help mitigate this. Thus, we add a nuanced understanding the role of top leadership in navigating the marketing–finance interface.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We contribute to the literature on firm-level drivers of customer satisfaction (e.g., [50]; [56]) by examining a previously ignored antecedent: M&amp;A activity. By showing that M&amp;As negatively impact customer satisfaction, we shed light on how higher-level strategic actions that are often motivated by shareholder motives can risk the marketing function's most prized asset, its customer relationships. Finally, we add to growing research in marketing on the use of observational inference to document the causal effects of strategic decisions.</p><a id="AN0155817137-33"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817137-33" title="Managerial Contributions">Managerial Contributions</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">M&amp;As have, on average, been shown to produce adverse financial effects. This has been attributed to overpayments as a result of optimism regarding synergies and cost efficiencies. However, we suggest that firms pay a price for dissatisfying customers during the M&amp;A process, and in fact, this effect persists two years post-M&amp;A. This finding is critical given that a recent survey of managers suggests that expanding a firm's customer base is a primary motivation for M&amp;As. Thus, ignoring the dysfunctional effect of M&amp;As on customers has serious long-term financial consequences and is inconsistent with firms' M&amp;A objectives. To demonstrate the financial impact of the M&amp;As due to a decline in customer satisfaction, we compared the firm value of M&amp;A and non-M&amp;A firms due to differences in customer satisfaction and firm efficiency with the estimation results from Table 3. Compared with that of non-M&amp;A firms, the customer satisfaction of M&amp;A firms was 1.14% lower a year after the M&amp;A. In contrast, compared with that of non-M&amp;A firms, the efficiency of M&amp;A firms was.29% higher in the same period. When we incorporated these estimates in the firm value model (Equation 1.3), we found that the value of M&amp;A firms was 2.43% lower than the non-M&amp;A firms a year after the M&amp;A. To calculate a change in firm value, we multiplied the percentage difference in value between M&amp;A and non-M&amp;A firms by the average firm value of the firms one year after an M&amp;A. We find M&amp;A firms' market value was worth $481 million less than that of the non-M&amp;A firms. Although firms may be motivated to pursue an M&amp;A to exploit scale-related synergies that provide cost-benefits, we show that efficiency gains fail to compensate for customer dissatisfaction-related financial losses. Thus, it is critical for managers responsible for M&amp;As and industry consultants to include a consumer impact assessment in their M&amp;A checklists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although there are several competing needs that require executives' attention during an M&amp;A process, it is essential for them to allocate some of their attention to customer-related issues. The financial payoff of such attention is meaningful. To demonstrate the impact of executives of M&amp;A firms paying attention to customers despite their tendency to focus on financial issues, we computed the percentage difference in customer satisfaction between M&amp;A firms whose executives pay more attention to customers (vs. finance) (1 SD above the mean) and M&amp;A firms whose executives pay less attention to customers (1 SD below the mean) with the results from Table 8 (Column 2b). Then, we used this percentage difference in customer satisfaction (.46%) to calculate a difference in firm value with the estimates from Table 3. We find that M&amp;A firms that pay more attention to customers relative to financial issues experience 45% reduction in loss in firm value from the M&amp;A (−1.34% vs. −2.43%). Thus, executive attention to customers can help firms significantly reduce M&amp;As' damaging effects on customer satisfaction and firm value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moreover, MROB can attenuate a decline in customer satisfaction and, thus, increase firm value. In our data, 27.34% of the firms had MROB at some point during the 1995–2017 sample period. To illustrate, we calculated the firm value impact of adding one marketing title to the board with the estimation results from the moderated-mediation analysis that we report in Table 8. First, we computed the percentage difference in customer satisfaction between M&amp;A firms with no MROB and M&amp;A firms with just one person with a marketing title on the board in the post-M&amp;A year with the results from Column 2b of Table 8, which is 2.85%. We then used this increase in customer satisfaction from MROB to calculate firm value with the estimates from Table 3 and find that the value of a firm with just one person with a marketing title on the board in the post-M&amp;A year was 4.28% higher compared with firms that did not have any MROB. Adding these board positions is not trivial, especially during an M&amp;A process. However, the financial consequence of not having MROB during M&amp;As is severe. Thus, we make the case for marketing's voice in the C-suite, which is an important MSI Tier 1 Research Priority for 2020–2022.</p><a id="AN0155817137-34"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0155817137-34" title="Limitations and Directions for Future Research">Limitations and Directions for Future Research</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Limiting dissatisfaction from M&amp;As is a complex task, and multiple antecedents, including deal and integration-related factors and firm-level variables that speak to other functions of the firm, should be considered. Recent research has also found that customer satisfaction has a direct positive effect on firm efficiency ([<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7_ref135" title="7">7</a>]), and future research could explore this pathway in the context of M&amp;As. Further, our sample size was limited to what the ACSI database of customer satisfaction could provide. Future studies could identify alternative data sets ([39]) to enlarge their sample to extend the time frame of the panel and data frequency to examine changes in satisfaction several years after the M&amp;As. In addition, we study customer satisfaction with the ACSI scores of acquirer firms and not target firms. This seems reasonable given that target firms are subsumed in acquiring firms, so any post-M&amp;A ACSI score should reflect customers of both firms. Still, future research might benefit from assessing changes in satisfaction for the target firm. The challenge is that most Compustat and ACSI data are unavailable for the target firm after it has been acquired. Alternative data sources, which include primary data on customer satisfaction at the business unit level could be a solution. Finally, we empirically show that the ABV of the firm is a viable theoretical mechanism to explain the effect of M&amp;As on customer satisfaction and how MROB moderates this relationship. Still, a change in executive attention is one of many potential pathways from M&amp;A activity to customer satisfaction. Future research could consider how the RBV compares with the ABV in explaining these effects.</p><a id="AN0155817137-35"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" id="ref_toc_AN0155817137-35" title=" Footnotes  "> Footnotes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  The authors contributed equally to the article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2">2</a>  Raj Venkatesan</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib3"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib3up" id="bib_upbib3" title="3">3</a>  The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib4"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4up" id="bib_upbib4" title="4">4</a>  The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib5"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib5up" id="bib_upbib5" title="5">5</a>  Online supplement:https://doi.org/10.1177/00222429211024255</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib6"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib6up" id="bib_upbib6" title="6">6</a>  Kraft Heinz's customer satisfaction ACSI score declined by five points, which is a 6.3% decrease.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib7"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib7up" id="bib_upbib7" title="7">7</a>  Although we did not hypothesize this, we tested the interaction effect between MROB and M&amp;As on customer satisfaction, and the result is nonsignificant (π<sub>6</sub> = −2.617, <em>p</em> &gt; .10).

On crowdfunding platforms, backers (i.e., individuals who fund ideas) jointly fund the same idea, leading to affiliations, or overlaps, within the community. The authors find that while an increase in the total number of backers may positively affect funding behavior, the resulting affiliations affect funding negatively. They reason that when affiliated others fund a new idea, individuals may feel less of a need to fund, a process known as "vicarious moral licensing." Drawing on data collected from 2,021 ideas on a prominent crowdfunding platform, the authors show that prior affiliation among backers negatively affects an idea's funding amount and eventual funding success. Creator engagement (i.e., idea description and updates) and backer engagement (i.e., Facebook shares) moderate this negative effect. The effect of affiliation is robust across several instrumental variables, model specifications, measures of affiliation, and multiple crowdfunding outcomes. Results from three experiments, a survey, and interviews with backers support the negative effect of affiliation and show that it can be explained by vicarious moral licensing. The authors develop actionable insights for creators to mitigate the negative effects of affiliation with the language used in idea descriptions and updates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: backer affiliation; crowdfunding; prosocial; social structure; vicarious moral licensing</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Crowdfunding has emerged as a dominant mechanism to harness the power of crowds in raising funds for innovative ideas. Interest in crowdfunding has surged in recent years. Facebook acquired Oculus 3D visualization device, a crowdfunded idea on Kickstarter, for US$3 billion ([14]). Peloton, the highly successful exercise bike, started as a Kickstarter project. The global crowdfunding market is expected to be well over US$40 billion by 2026 ([54]). Brands such as GE ([11]) and Unilever use crowdfunding to spur innovation ([53]), and academic research on the phenomenon and its role in the digital economy is emerging ([<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2_ref5" title="2">2</a>]; [12]). Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing in which participants, hereinafter referred to as "backers," are recruited to raise funds for ideas (e.g., [16]; [62]). As some backers fund the same ideas (i.e., "cobacking"), overlaps develop between these backers. These overlaps, called "affiliations," are key building blocks of the community's network structure and have been studied in other crowdsourcing communities (e.g., [48]). In this research, we explore how affiliation, defined as the number of cobacking relationships between potential backers and those who have previously funded the focal idea, might affect the idea's crowdfunding success. We illustrate affiliation in crowdfunding using a stylized example in Figure 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph: Figure 1. Illustration of affiliation in crowdfunding.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We know that crowd size affects outcomes positively as participants look to anonymous others for cues to decide which ideas to fund, a phenomenon referred to as "herding" (e.g., [66]). Previous research shows that attracting more backers positively impacts crowdfunding outcomes ([24]), an insight that many creators seem to grasp. However, crowd size does not represent the social structure (i.e., the pattern of connections in the community). In crowdfunding, as in other contexts in which shared communal goals exist (e.g., Wikipedia), social structure plays a more prominent role (e.g., [48]; [62]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our primary contribution is in showing that while the total number of backers (i.e., crowd size) may positively affect funding behavior and idea success (e.g., [66]), adding backers may not be unilaterally beneficial as the ensuing affiliation between backers negatively affects funding. Our analysis reveals that the negative effect of backer affiliation is above and beyond the positive effect of number of backers (i.e., the herding effect), highlighting the tension between the benefits of adding more backers and the adverse effects of backer affiliation. In other words, while adding a new backer (e.g., the focal backer in Figure 1) may positively affect the focal idea's success, adding this focal backer may not be <em>equally</em> beneficial across the three scenarios in Figure 1 as the degree of affiliation differs. We propose that the affiliation between the focal backer and other backers will influence the amount that the focal backer puts toward the focal idea and, thus, the idea's funding success.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Affiliation is a powerful force because it makes affiliated others' actions lead to changes in one's subsequent behavior (e.g., [35]; [57]). In some contexts, affiliation <em>positively</em> affects behavior as individuals desire to belong and therefore conform to affiliated others' behavior (e.g., [32]). However, in crowdfunding communities where individuals are often motivated by prosocial goals (e.g., [50]), we propose that such affiliation can <em>negatively</em> affect behavior. When individual actions benefit a social cause, seeing affiliated others participate may make individuals feel less of a need to do so, a process referred to as "vicarious moral licensing" (e.g., [13]; [22]; [37]). Thus, we propose that when backers decide whether to fund an idea, they are less likely to do so or more likely to fund a lower amount if affiliated others have already done so.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">While affiliations develop in the community through cobacking, creators and backers also engage through nonmonetary actions, thereby driving social interaction. Therefore, to develop further substantive implications about the effect of affiliation, we examine the moderating role of both creator and backer engagement (e.g., [<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref22" title="4">4</a>]; [35]). For example, creators communicate with backers through the description of the idea on its homepage, perceived to be an important determinant of an idea's success ([38]; [64]), and by posting updates about progress. Backers engage with the community by sharing ideas on social media. We aim to understand how the effect of affiliation varies due to creator and backer engagement, as they help shed light on the underlying mechanism that drives the effect of affiliation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We use multiple methods and data sets, including secondary data and experiments, to provide convergent validity to our findings. We also conduct interviews with 6 backers, survey 100 backers, and analyze 572 posts on backer forums to develop insights about the mechanism driving the effect of affiliation on funding outcomes. First, we assemble a comprehensive data set of daily funding for 2,021 new crowdfunded ideas listed on Kickstarter. We study two crowdfunding outcomes: (<a id="bib1up

We measure affiliation of an idea on the focal day as the number of cobacking relationships of backers who back on the focal day, with backers who funded until the day before the focal day (e.g., [35]; [41]). We estimate an instrumental variables regression model with fixed effects to assess the impact of affiliation among an idea's backers on the daily funding amount and report results from several robustness analyses. Second, we present results from controlled experiments, where we exogenously manipulate affiliation, and across three experiments, we replicate the negative effect of affiliation on funding, examine the underlying mechanism, and uncover the role of a key moderator. We find that the negative effect is stronger when creators use more communal words—both in the initial description of the idea and in subsequent updates—and when more backers share the idea on social media. Thus, creator and backer engagement may moderate prosocial motives to fund, further validating the proposed licensing mechanism.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We make several contributions. We are the first to show that affiliation among backers affects crowdfunding success in statistically and economically significant ways after controlling for herding and accounting for several alternative explanations. A 10% daily increase in number of backers would lead to an additional 20.2% in funding or an increase of US$83/day (i.e., the herding effect). In contrast, a 10% daily increase in backer affiliation would lead to an 8.7% decrease in funding or a decrease of US$36/day, offsetting the increase due to number of backers by about 43%. Thus, adding backers is good, but if the additional backers increase affiliation, the positive effect of adding these backers is smaller in the scenario where affiliation is high. We isolate vicarious moral licensing as a theoretical mechanism that drives the negative effect of affiliation through experiments. We explore the role of factors related to the idea, the creator, and the backers, all of which interact with affiliation.</p><a id="AN0158338729-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-2" title="Theoretical Background">Theoretical Background</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><a id="AN0158338729-3"> </a></p><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-3" title="Social Influences in Crowdfunding">Social Influences in Crowdfunding</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although crowdfunding has emerged as a dominant force for funding new ideas, research on crowdfunding is limited.

For example, [66] report that potential lenders assess borrowers' creditworthiness by observing other lenders. They attribute the positive effect of the number of other lenders to herding, wherein crowd size becomes a beacon for others to decide which ideas to fund. This finding might suggest that the mere addition of more supporters unilaterally benefits crowdfunding outcomes as potential backers simply follow other backers. What are some factors that might limit the positive impact of the crowd's behavior on crowdfunding? To answer this question, we note that most research has considered the presence of the anonymous crowd as the cause for a social effect that is generally positive. However, crowd size does not account for an important aspect of networks (i.e., the structure of connections among the community's participants).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Thus, what is missing in extant research is an explicit acknowledgment of social structure beyond crowd size and an exploration of how it impacts crowdfunding outcomes. Social structure arises due to coparticipation in events, in our case, cobacking across ideas, a phenomenon referred to as affiliation (e.g., [17]; [60]). Affiliation, identified as an important phenomenon in the new digital economy dominated by crowdsharing ([15]), is the central focus of our research.</p><a id="AN0158338729-4"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-4" title="Affiliation in Crowdfunding">Affiliation in Crowdfunding</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Communities evolve through repeated interactions between members, which give rise to affiliations or overlaps.

Discussions on crowdfunding message boards and websites, as well as results from a survey that we conducted (discussed in the following sections), further support this idea, suggesting that among all available information, backers do consider affiliated others' behavior as they make funding decisions. Next, to confirm that affiliation affects perceptions of connectedness and shared identity in crowdfunding communities, we ran a pilot study with 150 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants. We find that affiliation significantly increased perceptions of connectedness and shared identity with other backers (see Web Appendix B).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If potential backers notice affiliated others' behaviors and feel a sense of connectedness with these affiliated others, how might affiliated others' behavior influence their own funding decisions? To answer this important question, we next examine crowdfunding platforms and how they differ from noncommunal (i.e., transactional) contexts.</p><a id="AN0158338729-5"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-5" title="Vicarious Moral Licensing in Crowdfunding Communities">Vicarious Moral Licensing in Crowdfunding Communities</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Crowdfunding is a communal endeavor in which individuals collaborate to achieve shared goals, and platforms grow due to members' participation and interactions ([50]). Individuals behave differently in communal contexts than in noncommunal (i.e., transactional) contexts (e.g., [10]; [18]). For example, in communal contexts, individuals are more likely to request help from others, keep track of others' needs, respond to them, and report more positive emotions while doing so ([18]). In crowdfunding, these prosocial goals are reflected in the desire to help others, achieve funding goals, and be part of a community ([19]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In crowdfunding communities where individuals are often motivated by prosocial goals (e.g., [50]), we propose that seeing affiliated others fund may make individuals feel less of a need to do so, a process referred to as vicarious moral licensing (e.g., [13]; [22]; [37]). Vicarious moral licensing occurs when individuals see affiliated others' actions as satisfying their own goals, which changes their perceived moral imperative and subsequent behavior. For example, learning that affiliated others demonstrate environmentally friendly behavior makes individuals less likely to do so ([37]). It is important to recognize that this effect is not merely akin to strangers' behavior in a crowd (i.e., the bystander effect; e.g., [31]), but that it is those with whom an individual perceives a social connection (i.e., affiliation) that drives the focal effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To confirm the importance of affiliated others' behavior and further validate the proposed mechanism, we conducted in-depth interviews of 6 backers, surveyed 100 backers, and coded 572 posts from KickstarterForum.org, the dominant crowdfunding discussion forum (see Web Appendix C). The findings confirmed the prominence of prosocial (i.e., communal) motives on crowdfunding decisions, the importance of affiliated others' behavior on backers' own funding behavior, and the role of vicarious moral licensing. For example, as one interview participant explained, "I look at other funders only to further discover related projects. It's an interesting way to discover—because some people are more involved than you are.... It's interesting to follow that rabbit trail and see, 'Oh, this person supported this, and look at what else they fund.'" Another stated, "You are dealing with finite resources in terms of what you are willing to spend. If you support one thing, I don't know, for me, if I see someone supporting something else, I think, well yeah, they supported that. I'm sure I could find a bunch of other people that support a bunch of other things. I just gave X amount of dollars, whatever amount I have, and I'm not going to be giving any more than that right now."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although we propose vicarious moral licensing as the mechanism underlying the focal effect of affiliation and initial evidence indicates this to be the case, we acknowledge the complexity of social interactions in crowdfunding. Because these social interactions are likely to be subject to several factors, we consider uniqueness as an alternative explanation for the negative effect of affiliation on funding. Backers may try to identify ideas that have received less funding from affiliated others. By doing so, backers can distinguish themselves from these affiliated others, fulfilling a need for uniqueness (e.g., [59]). In our analysis, we report results from an experiment where we test vicarious moral licensing and uniqueness as potential explanations for the negative effect of affiliation on funding.</p><a id="AN0158338729-6"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-6" title="Moderators of the Effect of Affiliation on Crowdfunding Success">Moderators of the Effect of Affiliation on Crowdfunding Success</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Crowdfunding platforms are characterized by contributions from both creators and backers (e.g., [<a id="bib4up

Therefore, we explore the role of creator and backer engagement in moderating the impact of affiliation on crowdfunding.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Previous research has found that while prosocial goals may be common in crowdfunding platforms (e.g., [50]), an idea's description can further induce prosocial motivation and behavior when it emphasizes communal language ([23]). We propose that the vicarious moral licensing effect (i.e., the negative effect of affiliation on funding) is driven by the communal context and the prosocial behavior it prompts and that this behavior is further heightened by creators describing their ideas with communal words like "together" and asking backers to "partner" with them by providing financial "support" ([47]). As such, ideas described with more (vs. less) communal words will exhibit a stronger negative effect of affiliation on funding outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Creators can also engage with the backer community by posting updates to highlight their strategic goals and the idea's progress. Updates provide diagnostic information concerning an idea's success (e.g., [<a id="bib4up

Updates might draw backers' attention to the idea's characteristics and evolution, and lessen attention toward cobackers and affiliation. Consistent with the vicarious moral licensing mechanism, we expect updates that use more (vs. less) communal words to strengthen affiliation's negative effect. As such, we estimate the moderating effects of communal words in the creator's updates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also explore how backers' engagement might moderate the affiliation effect by exploring the role of social media sharing of the focal idea by backers. While sharing behavior on social media could have several motivations, altruism is perceived as a primary motivator, and others seeing the shares likely view them as such ([29]; [33]). We expect that such sharing heightens funders' prosocial motives and vicarious moral licensing, further strengthening the negative effect of affiliation.

Thus, the backer affiliation for a focal idea on a focal day is the number of cobacking relationships between those backers who fund the focal idea <em>on</em> the focal day and all backers who have funded the focal idea at any time <em>before</em> the focal day.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Consider a backer of a focal idea who funds the focal idea on the focal day.

One cobacking relationship represents one unit of affiliation. Affiliation increases both with the number of backers who coback and with the number of cobacked ideas.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To elaborate, consider the following examples.

The median number of backers who fund an idea in a day is 1, and most ideas have only a few backers. When a backer funds an idea, the median number of past backers of that idea is 10 backers (i.e., the median of the variable cumulative number of backers funding idea i before day t is 10). In the six months preceding data collection, 82% of backers in our data had not funded any idea on Kickstarter. Thus, the odds of having to remember multiple cobacking relationships are relatively low. Most importantly, the median value of affiliation is zero, and the mean is 3.3. In other words, a large majority of backers in our data must process a very small amount of information to infer affiliation. Our measure of affiliation reflects a more nuanced and disaggregated conceptualization of affiliations than the number of "cobacked ideas" or the number of "common backers." Other measures are likely sparser than our measure.

					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8_ref88" title="8">8</a>]), enabling us to control those time-varying idea-specific unobservables, which may be serially correlated (e.g., word of mouth about the idea) and to attenuate serial correlation among the residuals. This also accounts for the alternate explanation that affiliation on day t − 1 affects funding on day t − 1, but not on day t. By incorporating the lagged measure of funding, we can account for all factors that affect funding until the day t − 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We next discuss other time-varying idea-specific controls. First, the number of affiliations among backers is correlated with the number of backers. There can be no backer affiliations without backers; more backers could result in more possibilities for affiliation. To control for the possibility that the number of backers drives the effect of affiliation on funding, we include CumBackers<sub>it − 1</sub>, the cumulative number of backers funding idea i by day t − 1, as a control variable. Also, to the extent that ideas with more backers attract more funding ([66]), this serves as a measure for herding behavior. Second, creators communicate with backers via updates, a means to elevate idea visibility and signal effort ([12]). To understand how creator actions might drive funding, we include CumUpdates<sub>it − 1</sub>, the cumulative number of updates by the creator of the idea i by day t − 1. In addition, CommunalUpdates<sub>it − 1</sub> is the number of communal words contained in the updates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, the funding window of an idea influences its funding outcomes. Ideas receive more funding in the later stages of the funding window as the funding deadline nears (e.g., [12]; [31]). To account for this, we include the duration of the funding window completed for the idea (PropDuration<sub>it − 1</sub>) as a proportion of the total funding window (typically 30 days). Furthermore, ideas receive greater funding as they get closer to meeting their funding goals ([12]). Although daily fixed effects account for temporal variations in funding, they might not capture the effect of proximity to the funding goal. Therefore, we include PropGoal<sub>it − 1</sub>, the proportion of the funding goal of the idea that has been achieved until day t − 1, and LastWeek<sub>it − 1</sub>, a dummy variable for whether the observation belongs to the last week of the funding window.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, structural measures of network centrality might affect the outcome. Because these measures capture the extent of social capital that accrues to ideas due to being associated with certain backers, we want to control for the effects of these measures. We compute and include three of the most widely used network measures in marketing (e.g., [35]; [48]; [58]), (Network<sub>it − 1</sub>): closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality of idea i on day t. Closeness centrality in our context is how close the focal idea is from all the backers (connected and not connected) in the network, betweenness centrality is the extent to which the focal idea lies on the common paths between all pairs of backers in the network, and eigenvector centrality is the extent to which the focal idea's backers are prolific in backing other ideas. We computed both bipartite and single-mode network variants of each of these measures.[<a id="bib9up

As shown in the correlation matrix of all variables (Table 4), these variables are not highly correlated with our measure of affiliation, suggesting that affiliation captures the network's unique structural properties based on counts of overlaps. To assess interaction effects, we interact affiliation with CommunalUpdates<sub>it − 1</sub>[10] and with the number of Facebook shares of the idea by backers (FBShares<sub>i</sub>).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 4.

The prototypical problem in the marketing literature on the identification of peer effects (e.g., [40]) is to estimate the likelihood of agent A adopting a product (e.g., buying an online game) under the knowledge that agent B (a self-identified "friend" or influencer) has already adopted that same product. The herding literature has conclusively documented positive peer effects across various consumer contexts (e.g., [57]; [66]). If there are positive effects due to the size of the crowd or the number of peers, that would be equivalent to herding, not our study's primary focus. In other words, our main objective is not to estimate how backer A will fund the focal idea if another backer B has previously funded it. We account for herding in our model by incorporating the prior number of backers of the focal idea as a control. Instead, our objective is to study the effect of affiliation, which is formed when two backers back an idea that is not the focal idea. Affiliation arises in collaborative contexts (e.g., board interlocks, product development teams) rather than common product purchases. We note that this is a key difference of our article from other contexts. In addition, our interest is less in modeling agent behavior (e.g., an individual's rating of a product in [57]) than in modeling product success (i.e., funding success of an idea). We next address three main issues that could confound identifying the causal effect of affiliation on the focal idea's funding.</p><a id="AN0158338729-15"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-15" title="Correlated unobservables">Correlated unobservables</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Idea-specific characteristics that are not observable to the researcher could be correlated with our affiliation measure and affect the focal idea's funding. Perhaps highly affiliated backers are attracted to ideas with high (or low) unobserved quality. The inability to control for quality dimensions might induce an upward (or downward) bias in our estimate of the effect of affiliation. Following [40] and [57], we incorporate idea-specific fixed effects. These effectively control for all idea-specific factors that might be correlated with affiliation. Next, there could be time-varying factors across the funding window that might be correlated with affiliation and funding. For example, affiliation and funding are both likely to be low in the first few days of funding. We control for all day-specific trends by incorporating day fixed effects. Finally, the presence of idea-specific time-varying factors cannot be ruled out. We control for funding received by the focal idea on day t − 1. As mentioned previously, this approach enables us to control those time-varying idea-specific unobservables, which may be serially correlated, and to attenuate serial correlation among the residuals.</p><a id="AN0158338729-16"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-16" title="Simultaneity">Simultaneity</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In the context of peer influence, simultaneity implies that not only can the influencer influence the focal individual but the focal individual could also affect the influencer's actions, leading to an upward bias in the estimate of peer effects. In our context, affiliations formed on a focal day may affect the focal idea's funding. Simultaneously, the focal idea's funding on a focal day also affects affiliation formation on that day. Following recent literature (e.g., [45]), we use the lagged measures of affiliation in the model. While affiliation before the focal day can affect funding on the focal day, the reverse is not possible.</p><a id="AN0158338729-17"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-17" title="Endogenous group formation (or homophily)">Endogenous group formation (or homophily)</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Backers with similar preferences may be more likely to behave similarly. In such a scenario, the effect of prior affiliation on subsequent funding of the focal idea might manifest these common preferences. The literature on consumer peer effects has used consumer-specific fixed effects to deal with this. However, crowdfunding is different from consumer contexts in that while consumers buy (and evaluate) several products, backers typically fund very few ideas on a platform.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Moreover, unlike crowdfunding, consumer contexts generally focus on the individual more than collective action ([50]). So, backer-specific fixed effects are econometrically infeasible to estimate for both the researcher and the platform. Instead, we first include the cumulative number of backers and several other network measures as controls. Next, we note that controlling for lagged funding of the idea also controls backer characteristics that have affected funding before the focal day.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, we include an instrument for affiliation. If our measure of affiliation is correlated with the error term in Equation 1, its coefficient could be biased. In our primary analysis, we use an observed instrument to estimate a two-stage least-squares instrumental variable regression model. As [49], p. 4) mentions, the ideal solution for endogeneity is to conduct an experiment where the endogenous variable is uncorrelated with the construction's dependent variable. Therefore, we ran controlled experiments, which we explain subsequently, where participants were randomly assigned to different affiliation levels, creating exogenous variation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For the primary instrumental variable approach, we follow recent research (e.g., [20]; [51]) that uses instruments based on agent behavior in categories (or firms) different from the focal category (or a firm). Following this approach, we use the mean (across ideas) of affiliations on day t − 1 of all ideas in our Kickstarter data, which are in a category different from that of the focal idea as the primary instrument for Affil<sub>it − 1</sub> in Kickstarter. For example, for an observation about an idea on movies on December 22, this instrument is the mean of affiliations on December 22 of all ideas in our data that are not in the movies category.

However, because most backers only back one idea (i.e., affiliation is sparse), the mean affiliation across ideas in other categories is very unlikely to be related to the unobserved component of the focal idea's funding outcome in Equation 1 providing the basis for identification. Further, a category-level measure of affiliation should remain unaffected by idea-level factors, especially if the idea is from a different category. A category-level measure should not correlate strongly with idea-day-level idiosyncratic shocks from another category, thus meeting the exclusion criterion.

This effect persists despite the inclusion of idea-specific fixed effects, daily fixed effects, controlling for lagged funding, and the prior number of backers of the idea. We corroborate extant findings on herding (e.g., [66]) and additionally show that affiliation plays a key role and that its effect is negative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Concerning the moderators, the creator's engagement measured as using communal words in updates further strengthens the negative effect of affiliation, perhaps because of a heightened licensing effect (β = −7.68, <em>p </em>&lt; .01). For backer engagement, we find the negative effect of affiliation is stronger as backer engagement, measured as the number of Facebook shares of the idea by backers, increases (β = −.006, <em>p </em>&lt; .01). One explanation of this is that while individuals share on Facebook for various motives, the primary motivation is prosocial, and others seeing the shares likely see them as such, strengthening the vicarious moral licensing effect ([29]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Concerning control variables, the greater the number of backers of an idea before the focal day, a measure of herding, the more funding the idea will attract on the focal day (β = 2.02, <em>p </em>&lt; .01). This indicates that the total number of backers for an idea may act as a signal of its quality or potential worthiness, a finding that is consistent with prior research (e.g., [34]). The current research replicates this effect and demonstrates that social structure influences behavior beyond the herding effect. Moreover, this theory supports our contention that affiliation, measured by cobacking, drives the negative effect, not herding. We also find that the total number of updates posted by the creator has a negative effect on crowdfunding success (β = −.05, <em>p </em>&lt; .10), although this effect is not significant across all model specifications. The effect of the proportion of the funding goal which was achieved on the previous day is negative (β = −.17, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), perhaps suggesting a preference to fund underfunded ideas. For network centrality measures, we find that betweenness (β = −.02, <em>p </em>&lt; .05) and eigenvector centrality (β = −4.40, <em>p</em> &lt; .05) have a negative effect on funding. The negative effects of these second-order network measures, compared with the positive effect of number of backers (proxy for first-order network effect), highlight the complexity in flow of information on the network and are consistent with findings from prior studies (e.g., [35]). This is perhaps because these measures indicate the backers' ability to identify and fund salient opportunities, or access to information from their overall networks about idea quality based on indirect ties across the whole network, not just direct ties. Thus, the effects also highlight the importance of distinguishing direct and indirect aspects of how networks operate in community contexts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To ensure that outliers are not driving our results, we estimate the main model (M5) after dropping the top 10th percentile of observations (which have affiliation values greater than 7), yielding a significant and negative estimate of the affiliation coefficient (β = −.87, <em>p </em>&lt; .01). We find a similar negative effect in models estimated on various subsets of the data. To investigate if specific categories of ideas drive our results, we estimate the model separately for each category's ideas. We find a negative effect of affiliation for 11 out of 12 categories, with the most negative effect of affiliation in the ideas from the photography and technology categories. Our estimate of affiliation's effect is negative but not statistically significant for the "dance" category, which accounts for just 21 out of 2,021 ideas in our data.</p><a id="AN0158338729-20"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-20" title="Robustness analyses">Robustness analyses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We conducted several robustness analyses.

They were then asked how much they would give toward the idea on a nine-point scale with dollar amounts in $.25 intervals, ranging from $0 to $2.00. If participants chose "$0" and opted to keep the full bonus, they were then forwarded to the end of the survey and were paid the original MTurk fee as well as the $2 bonus. If participants used any of their bonus to fund the first idea, they were included in our primary analyses. Ninety-three participants opted not to fund the first idea, leaving us with 107 participants. Four participants were removed who indicated that they had a child affected by autism, the focus of one of the two ideas, and were inclined toward funding but would opt to put the money toward helping their child.

Those in the control-affiliation condition were not provided any information about other backers' funding decisions. Participants then read about diveLIVE, a technology that allows divers to talk underwater while streaming live video to the internet. diveLIVE, the focal idea, was described as more or less communal with small changes (e.g., "Let's learn about the oceans" vs. "This product uses technology to take videos of the oceans").</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Next, participants indicated how much money they would pledge toward diveLIVE, the focal idea (range: $0–$20,000, the total needed to hit the focal idea's funding goal).

To validate the third experiment with converging evidence, we returned to our secondary data to examine how the number of communal words in the idea description influenced the relationship between affiliation and funding behavior across thousands of crowdfunding ideas (e.g., [42]). This would establish how the use of communal words in creator's updates as well as in the idea's description would influence the effect of backer affiliation and highlight the importance of the communal mechanism. We used the same text dictionary that we created for coding communal words in updates and coded the description of every idea in our sample. The median number of communal words in an idea description is 3 (M = 6.1). We then created two subsets of our data based on a median split of the number of communal words used in describing the idea. We estimated the model separately on each subset and find that the coefficient of affiliation is less negative for ideas described using three or fewer communal words (M = −.92, SE = .09) than for ideas described using four or more communal words (M = −1.25, SE = .15). Replacing the number of communal words in this analysis with the ratio of the number of communal words to the total number of words does not affect this result, nor does splitting the data on the basis of the average number of communal words instead of the median. Finally, the effect of affiliation is less negative for ideas with no communal words than for ideas with at least one communal word. This provides real-world evidence for the role of idea description on the relationship between affiliation and funding behavior, validating our theory and experimental evidence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In summary, these findings further support our reasoning that the negative effect of affiliation is driven, at least in part, by the communal nature of crowdfunding and the prosocial mindset that it prompts ([50]). When an idea is described as more communal, these prosocial goals are exacerbated, leading potential backers to feel that they do not need to fund the idea because these affiliated others are funding it (e.g., [37]). However, when an idea is described as less communal, this effect is mitigated. Next, we discuss our results and develop implications for theory and practice.</p><a id="AN0158338729-26"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-26" title="Discussion">Discussion</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We establish a negative effect of affiliation on the crowdfunding success of ideas using a large empirical study and then validating the effect through experiments. We provide preliminary insights into the role of vicarious moral licensing as the underlying mechanism for this effect and investigate the moderating role of creator and backer engagement. The licensing effect and its role in reducing backers' perceived obligation to fund ideas could make backers less likely to fund or fund with less money if they opt to fund, both of which could explain the negative effect at the idea level. We begin with a focus on the novel contribution of our finding concerning affiliation, discuss the economic implications of our results, and identify the primary contributions of our research and how it paves the way for future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The negative effect of affiliation among backers in crowdfunding is distinct from and in addition to the positive effect of herding due to the crowd's size shown in prior research (e.g., [66]). We establish an inherent tension between the positive effect of crowd size and the negative effect of backer affiliation in crowdfunding. Thus, we show that, in addition to relying on crowd size, backers make inferences based on the behavior of affiliated others in a crowdfunding context. A 10% daily increase in number of backers leads to an additional 20.2% in funding or an increase of US$83/day (i.e., the herding effect). In contrast, a 10% daily increase in backer affiliation leads to an 8.7% decrease in funding or a decrease of US$36/day, offsetting the increase due to number of backers by 43%. Our results concerning affiliation are both statistically and economically meaningful and highlight the need to recognize the tension between increasing the number of backers and limiting the ill effects of affiliation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interestingly, Kickstarter stopped disclosing the prior backers' list on an idea's page as of the time of writing this article. This policy change is consistent with our results. If backer identities remain unknown, potential backers cannot infer affiliation, and therefore ideas cannot be negatively impacted by backer affiliation. Other crowdfunding platforms should reevaluate disclosure policies about past backers of an idea or perhaps reconsider whom they show at the top of their backer lists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">So how might creators mitigate the negative effects of affiliation? The moderation effects from our results provide actionable insights for creators seeking crowdfunding from potential backers and considering what platforms to pursue. Our results concerning the interaction between affiliation and creator engagement show that creators can subdue the negative effects of affiliation by carefully crafting the idea description and updates, avoiding communal language.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Further, while it appears that encouraging backers to share the idea on social media might be counterproductive because it strengthens affiliation's negative effect, the impact is small and should not be a major concern. The change in the marginal effect of affiliation as sharing by backers increases is small, indicating that change in backers' engagement, while statistically significant, does not have a meaningful effect on crowdfunding. Doubling the number of Facebook shares from its mean of 79 to 148 strengthens the negative effect of affiliation by.42% and translates to a decline of US$1.72/day.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We developed recommendations for creators and examples of best practices from our data set (see Table 6). For example, creators should focus on the idea's inherent purpose and objective value in its description and avoid using too much communal language (e.g., cooperate, partner, support) in the idea description and updates. Overall, we recommend that platforms educate creators on how best to structure communication with backers and guide creators in meeting their goals. Backers could perhaps learn to interpret such updates better and use the information provided by the backer to qualify what they infer from the community.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Graph</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Table 6.

Research has shown that licensing is a nonconscious effect and can be mitigated by making individuals aware of their behavior ([27]). Particularly in this type of vicarious moral licensing, highlighting individuals' uniqueness and independent identity may also mitigate the negative effect of affiliation on funding ([30]; [37]; [43]). If creators expect high overlap among backers, they could describe their ideas using less communal language, thereby lowering the licensing effect. Our results suggest that vicarious licensing might overwhelm other relevant idea information, potentially leading to suboptimal backer decisions. In line with our findings, backers might, in some cases, pay more attention to signals from affiliated others rather than from the whole crowd.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For crowdfunding platforms, our findings provide a rationale for why there might be room for new crowdfunding platforms to thrive and grow. Although several crowdfunding platforms have flourished in the past decade, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe have arguably dominated the market. Other once-popular platforms, such as Sellaband and PledgeMusic, have failed. Large platforms with millions of backers might pose high entry barriers to new entrants. However, our findings point to one source of competitive advantage for newer platforms: negative affiliation effects are more likely to occur in well-established platforms with large backer communities. Strategically building diverse and unaffiliated communities of backers might confer a competitive advantage to new platforms. Our results show that this can be achieved by expanding the number of categories of ideas, as affiliation's negative effect may be mitigated as backers of ideas across different categories may be less likely to coback ideas. The failure of category-specific platforms such as Sellaband (music), and the relative success of platforms hosting diverse ideas, such as Kickstarter, provides support for this reasoning. Second, platforms allocating marketing resources across existing and new backers (e.g., allocating social media spending across established markets such as Los Angeles and new markets such as Lima) could perhaps view our results as a reason to divert resources away from backer-dense markets. Third, platforms that provide backer information may also want to use algorithms that promote unaffiliated (vs. affiliated) backers, for example, by highlighting first-time backers. Finally, drawing on our results about creator engagement, we recommend that platforms educate creators on how to design better backer communication.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Insights from our study are relevant to other types of crowdsourcing platforms as well. For example, participants on LEGO's Ideas, which focuses on ideation, and SeedInvest, which helps raise equity, could mitigate the negative effects of affiliation, for example, by describing initiatives as less communal and by posting updates with less communal language. Our findings are also applicable to crowdfunding contests (e.g., [<a id="bib9up

Reward structures could impact the role of affiliation in crowdfunding and thus merit attention (e.g., [56]). Fake reviews have been investigated in the online context (e.g., [67]), and it would be interesting to explore the veracity of idea descriptions and creator updates. In addition to affiliation, which we study, other network characteristics such as clans and core–periphery structures ([60]) could explain the nature of information flow across affiliation structures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As interest in crowdfunding increases, interesting research questions continue to emerge. We believe that our research explores important questions concerning crowdfunding that involve backer affiliation and community structure, and we hope to lay the foundation for future studies in the domain.</p><a id="AN0158338729-27"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0158338729-27" title="Supplemental Material">Supplemental Material</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211031814 - Supplemental material for Do Backer Affiliations Help or Hurt Crowdfunding Success?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-jmx-10.1177_00222429211031814 for Do Backer Affiliations Help or Hurt Crowdfunding Success? by Kelly B.

Recent meta-analytic research reveals the average economic impact of market share performance and identifies some factors affecting its value. However, empirical understanding of why any market share–profit relationship exists and varies is limited. The authors simultaneously examine the three primary theoretical mechanisms linking firm market share with profit. On average, they find that most of the variance in market share's positive effect on firm profit is explained by market power and quality signaling, with little support for operating efficiency as a mechanism. They find a similar explanatory role of the three mechanisms in conditions where market share negatively predicts profit (for niche firms and those "buying" market share). Using these mechanism insights, the authors show that the value of market share differs in predictable ways between firms and across industries, providing new understanding of when managers may usefully set market share goals. The authors also provide new insights into how market share should be measured for goal setting and performance monitoring. They show that revenue market share is a predictor of firm profit while unit market share is not, and that relative measures of revenue market share can provide greater predictive power.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: market share; quality; efficiency; market power; niche; firm profit; revenue share; unit share</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Many firms use market share to set goals and monitor marketing performance, and market share is also widely used in research examining marketing's performance impact ([24]; [40]). [20] recent meta-analytic study (hereinafter, E-H 2018) reports a significant positive relationship between a firm's market share and its economic performance and identifies contingencies affecting this relationship. However, while the literature suggests several reasons market share may drive firm performance, few empirical studies have directly examined any (and none more than one) of these mechanisms. Thus, little is known about the underlying "why" of mechanism(s) linking firms' market share and economic performance and how they may both explain previously identified moderators and facilitate identification of additional moderators of this important relationship. In addition, when understanding of the mechanisms linking market share with firm performance suggests that it is economically valuable to measure market share for goal setting and performance monitoring purposes, managers currently have no empirical insights into how to do so.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These knowledge gaps are important because understanding why market share is linked to firms' future profit can provide new insights into when and where market share is most likely to be valuable. While many firms use market share as a marketing performance metric, our research identifies new ways for managers to assess when this is most appropriate—and when it may not be. Because market share is such a common marketing goal, this is also important in delineating the role that marketing plays in determining firm performance and in understanding contingencies that may affect this role. Exploring the predictive value of alternative measures of market share, we also provide important new insights into how market share goals should be set and performance assessed via different market share measurement options in terms of unit versus revenue market share and absolute versus relative market share.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In addressing these key questions, this study offers several contributions. First, we provide the first direct empirical assessment of the three primary causal mechanisms that have been theorized to link market share with firm profit: market power, operating efficiency, and quality signaling. Using direct measures, we examine each of these three mechanisms simultaneously and show that both market power and quality signaling are key mechanisms linking market share with firm profit. On average, we find little evidence of theorized economies of scale and learning benefits of market share, but we identify conditions under which such efficiency benefits do exist. We find no support for a fourth theorized mechanism linking market share negatively with profit as a result of a strong competitor orientation. However, we do find support for the same three mechanisms in conditions under which the market share–firm profit relationship is negative—for niche firms and when a firm "buys" market share. Overall, these findings provide important new empirical insights into market share's value-creating role.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, using these new causal mechanism insights, we explore the consistency of the market share–profit relationship across different types of marketplaces and firms where the relative value of market share via the three mechanisms may be expected to vary. We show that the market share–profit relationship varies across industries and firms, and that the different causal mechanisms identified provide high explanatory power for such variations; thus, all three theories from which the hypothesized mechanisms arise can be "correct." In addition, this insight provides an empirically supported way for managers to identify when setting market share goals and monitoring market share performance may be more or less valuable. In contrast, we find that using indirect contingencies to try to infer the mechanisms linking market share with performance relationship often does not align with the directly observed mechanism effects, further indicating the value of direct measures in understanding the "why" mechanisms involved.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, we extend recent meta-analytic insights regarding the nature of the relationship between market share and firms' economic performance by using direct measures of the three most widely cited mechanisms: measures of both revenue and unit market share and different market share benchmarks, firm size controls to isolate the benefits of market share versus firm scale, and different econometric approaches to address panel data and endogeneity estimation concerns. These aspects of our study enable us to provide several new insights. For example, we show that for most firms, economies of scale arise from firm size and not firm market share. They also allow us to identify which market share metrics are most predictive of profit for different types of firms and the economic value of increasing market share on these metrics. This is useful new knowledge for managers because it provides new insights into how market share should be measured in goal setting and performance monitoring as well as the scale of profit benefits that may be expected from any gain in a firm's market share.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The article is organized as follows. First, we develop a conceptual framework and hypothesize relationships involving the three key mechanisms by which market share may be linked with firms' future profit. Next, we use the three mechanisms to identify three conditions under which the market share–profit relationship may be expected to be stronger versus weaker. We then describe the data set assembled and analysis approaches used to test the hypotheses and discuss the results. Having shown that the three mechanisms collectively mediate the market share–profit relationship, we then assess whether this remains true even under conditions when the market share–profit relationship is negative. Next, having shown that managers can use knowledge of the three mechanisms to identify when market share is likely to be economically valuable for their firm, we assess how managers may best measure market share. Finally, we assess the implications of our study for theory and practice and identify new questions for future research suggested by our findings.</p><a id="AN0157259283-2"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259283-2" title="Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses">Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Much of the theorizing regarding market share and firm performance in economics and management concerns related but distinct phenomena such as firm size and market concentration. We focus only on relationships that directly pertain to firm market share and the mechanisms underlying its economic value. As a result, we center our market share conceptualization on revenue market share—units sold × realized price (i.e., sales revenue) divided by total market sales revenue. In doing so, we conceptualize and measure the "market" as comprising firms selling similar product/service offerings. However, we also examine unit market share—units sold divided by total market unit sales—as well as several different operationalizations of revenue market share in robustness checks and post hoc analyses.</p><a id="AN0157259283-3"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259283-3" title="Market Share and Firm Economic Performance">Market Share and Firm Economic Performance</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The marketing literature generally views market share as an indicator of the success of a firm's efforts to compete in a product-marketplace (e.g., [13]; [63]). From this perspective, market share is an outcome of a firm's marketing efforts including its advertising and promotion, product/service offering quality and price, channel and customer relationships, and selling activities ([24]). All of these are evaluated relative to those of other suppliers by customers (channel members and end users) when they consider and select offerings, which is what conceptually distinguishes a firm's market share (how the firm's sales compare with those of the total market) from its sales revenue (the number of units sold × price). Importantly, this means that (unlike sales revenue) market share is not a component variable in any indicators of firm economic performance,[<a id="bib6up

Industrial organization theory posits that firms enjoy superior profit when they are able to charge higher prices than rivals, which is determined by the availability of alternatives to customers and firms' ability to create and/or control resources that give them stronger market positions (e.g., [57]). Market share may be a resource that provides a firm with the opportunity for greater market power over both "upstream" suppliers and "downstream" channels and customers and thereby control prices in several ways.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For upstream suppliers, buyer firms with higher end-user market share are more attractive, which may allow them to negotiate lower prices and/or higher-quality inputs from their suppliers ([<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9_ref14" title="9">9</a>]). For example, Apple's smartphone market share allows it to both charge app developers for selling their products and enforce strict quality controls on the apps it sells. It may also increase supplier willingness to cooperate with others in the buyer's supply network to further lower the buyer's input costs and improve input quality ([28]). For downstream channels, higher–market share firms are more attractive upstream partners because they generate end-user demand for more and/or higher-value products. They may also attract larger customer numbers and/or more frequent interactions for channels to engage in cross-selling. This may enable higher–market share firms to negotiate better list prices than rivals in downstream channels and to benefit from greater channel cooperation (e.g., preferred shelf-space, merchandizing support). For example, PepsiCo's snacks division leverages its leading market share position to obtain preferential shelf and display access in many U.S. retail chains. The input and go-to-market cost and quality benefits of higher–market share firms should allow them to provide better value offerings, which may thus allow them to charge higher prices to end users (as in the case with Apple) and/or enjoy higher profit margins on each unit sold (e.g., Walmart).

Disputing market power arguments, the "Chicago school" in economics argues that market share is an outcome of firm efficiency that allows a firm to sell quality-equivalent offerings at lower prices than rivals, attracting greater demand (e.g., [14]; [50]). Following this logic, strategic management scholars propose that higher market share may also allow firms to further increase their efficiency in a recursive relationship with lowering firm costs via learning effects (e.g., [<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1_ref19" title="1">1</a>]; [29]). Much of this logic is framed in terms of a firm's position on the production "experience curve" as a function of the volume of units sold, with greater experience allowing production-related learning and lower production costs (e.g., [30]). Thus, firms selling a greater number of units produce more and learn how to do so more efficiently. For example, Tesla has used its greater accumulated experience in producing electric vehicles (EVs) to lower its costs compared with rivals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Conceptually, this may also be possible via market share impacting the number of interactions a firm has with suppliers, channels, and customers, enhancing opportunities for higher–market share firms to learn and use knowledge gained to improve their supply-and-demand chains ([55]). For example, Tesla has used its greater EV sales to learn how to drive improvements in battery designs and configurations from suppliers as well as to optimize its own software to increase EV range. More interactions also increase the likelihood that suppliers, channels, and customers will trust higher–market share firms, increasing information sharing, lowering coordination costs, and enhancing cooperation in changes designed to enhance the firm's supply-and-demand chains ([16]; [27]). This should enable higher–market share firms to lower costs and enhance supply-and-demand chain quality and reliability, allowing superior value offerings for customers and/or greater margins.

Information economics theory posits that customers' limited evaluative knowledge often makes it difficult for them to observe "true" product/service quality (e.g., [38]; [41]). Empirical studies also show that customers are often unable to accurately (or confidently) evaluate an offering's quality prior to making purchase decisions, and they frequently rely on indirect cues (e.g., [47]; [61]). Market share may signal quality by increasing the credibility of firm claims and thereby lowering customer perceived risk ([21]; [34]). Customers may also infer that "everyone can't be wrong" in choosing the offerings of a high–market share firm (e.g., [18]). For example, Toyota campaigns have touted that its products are "#1 for a Reason." Thus, to the extent that market share signals higher quality, it should increase future demand and reduce customer churn. It may also lower the firm's costs relative to rivals, because alternative ways to signal quality (e.g., advertising) may be more costly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Market share may also signal quality to suppliers and channel members. Firms that are perceived to be producing high-quality offerings may be viewed by suppliers as not just attractive buyers, in terms of their own demand, but also as potentially providing a halo image spillover benefit. Similar to customers viewing them as having "too much to lose" to provide inferior offerings, supplier choices made by high–market share firms may be viewed as being based on ensuring high quality and reliable inputs to protect their reputation and market position. For example, Apple's suppliers are frequently identified as such in business press reports. This could also apply to channel partners where selling offerings that are perceived as higher quality can provide a halo effect making the channel member more attractive to other suppliers and end-user customers (e.g., [42]). All of these arguments suggest the following:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><ul><li><strong> H3: </strong><span class="medium-normal"> The positive effect of market share on firm profit is mediated by the firm's perceived quality.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0157259283-8"> </a><div class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#toc" onclick="FocusElement(&#39;toc&#39;);" id="hd_toc_AN0157259283-8" title="Using Mechanism Insights to Predict Where Market Share Is Valuable">Using Mechanism Insights to Predict Where Market Share Is Valuable</a></h3></div><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prior research suggests that the value of market share varies across industries (e.g., [<a id="bib4up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="https://web.s.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?vid=14&amp;sid=07672f09-7c6e-46d7-b9ef-5c5cd3cbc0cd%40redis#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4_ref33" title="4">4</a>]), indicating that setting market share goals may be more beneficial for some firms than others. To explore this, E-H's (2018) meta-analysis examines the sample characteristics most commonly reported in prior studies and reports that market share is more valuable in business-to-customer (B2C) markets and in markets with medium market concentration, whereas it is less valuable in the banking industry. While offering initial useful insight to managers, these boundary conditions are limited in number and scope—and the "why" mechanisms involved are unobserved. Robust empirical understanding of the mechanisms using direct assessments should allow additional boundary conditions to be identified and provide empirically verified principles for managers to distinguish when they should and should not care about market share.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">To provide an initial assessment of the predictive value of our mechanism results and offer new insights for managers, we next examine the extent to which the market share–profit relationship varies under conditions in which each of the three mechanism in turn may be expected a priori to be more versus less important. For each mechanism, we identify a condition expected to be particularly impactful on that particular market share–profit pathway. However, in our analyses we also allow for the possibility that each of the conditions we identify may affect the strength of all three mechanisms linking market share with profit. First, in terms of market power we examine industries characterized by higher customer switching costs, where firms are more easily able to retain customers. Firms should benefit more from the market power provided by market share when switching costs are high because they are better placed to increase prices without fear of customers switching ([23]; [58]; [60]).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Second, in terms of the value of operating efficiency in explaining the market share–profit relationship, the literature suggests that cost-reducing learning effects are more likely earlier in the life of a firm (e.g., [66]). For example, "experience effect" studies of the value of a firm's cumulative doubling of output show that this is more likely to occur early in a firm's existence (e.g., [31]). In addition, learning effects require changing and adapting firms' processes—which tend to become more rigid over time (e.g., [54]). Thus, younger firms are less knowledgeable in their operations and less "set in their ways," providing incentives to seek out the learning opportunities presented by market share and the ability to exploit the efficiency-enhancing knowledge gained via process changes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Third, to explore conditions where the quality-signaling value of market share may be stronger, we examine differences between "service-dominant" and "goods-dominant" industries.[<a id="bib7up
