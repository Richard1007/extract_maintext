1,A Cinderella Story: How Past Identity Salience Boosts Demand for Repurposed Products," Like Cinderella, many repurposed products involve a biographical transformation, from a tattered past identity (e.g., an old airbag) to a product with a valuable but different new identity (e.g., a backpack made from an airbag). In this article, the authors argue that marketers should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the products' tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four controlled experiments show that making a product's past identity salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these products' biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special. Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.","A worn-out airbag becomes a backpack. A leaky boat turns into a table. An old mosquito net transforms into a laptop sleeve. Product biographies that entail transformations from an old past identity to a new product identity are characteristic of production modes that involve the repurposing of old or dysfunctional products into new products. These include recycling, which is already common practice ([86]), and upcycling, which is gaining in popularity ([63]; [85]). For instance, a search on Instagram for upcycling yields over 1 million results, and the upcycled offers on the online marketplace Etsy have increased by 1,000% since 2011, with Etsy now featuring more than 300,000 different upcycled products in the United States alone. Many established companies, such as the outdoor brand Patagonia or the fashion retailers ASOS and Urban Outfitters, have also started to operate in this domain.However, when companies offer new products manufactured from old or waste products, how can they ensure that customers will demand these products? In this article, we show how the unique properties of repurposed and transformed products illustrate a novel way of storytelling in marketing. Unlike conventionally produced goods, such products have both a clear past and present product identity. Although they may vastly diverge in their form and purpose, both identities are embodied in the product. We argue that the past identity of a repurposed product amounts to the starting point of its biographical story of transformation, and that this holds storytelling potential. We refer to this strategy of alerting customers to a product's past identity as ""past identity salience"" and argue that it increases demand because it triggers narrative product thoughts and allows customers to feel special with the storied product. Notably, the past identity involves a waste product (e.g., a broken mosquito net) that may not serve the product's current primary function (e.g., a wallet made from a broken mosquito net). Even though a product's past identity is effectively useless (and potentially even disgusting), we suggest that marketers highlight it because it unlocks the product's storytelling potential.Results of three field experiments, four experiments conducted in controlled settings, and several replication studies support these claims. Our evidence pertains to different proxies of demand, stretches across multiple product categories and past identities, holds at both the store and product level, and emerges across different methods of making the past identity salient. We rule out several alternative accounts (perceived environmental friendliness, interestingness, surprise, originality, authenticity, a handmade effect, and informational value) and deduce two relevant boundary conditions. When a mere glance at the product allows customers to discern its past, simple appeals to the past identity do not further increase demand. Moreover, making the past identity salient only increases demand if the product had a prior life—and thus, a starting point of its biographical story. This applies to upcycling and the closely related practice of recycling ([55]; [86]) but not to conventionally produced products.The present research offers important contributions to the storytelling literature in marketing. First, we show that marketers can utilize products' own biographical stories rather than craft stories around product use or brand values, which dominate existing practices ([ 3]; [27]; [71]; [79]). Second, and in line with the story-prone nature of the human mind ([10]; [15]), we show that storytelling does not require explicit detail. Simple cues suffice for customers to note the presence of a story and essentially tell it to themselves ([40]). Notably, we show that this boosts demand even if the starting point of these stories is prosaic, such as a past identity as a mundane pallet or an old mosquito net. Third, and drawing on the finding that storied objects are deemed special ([34]), we identify a rarely examined key mechanism that underlies our effects on demand: storied products provide customers with felt specialness.We also contribute to the growing literature on products that entail the use of materials with a prior life and identity ([ 1]). As one of the first empirical studies of upcycling from a marketer's perspective, we highlight that success is more likely if marketers focus on the special biographies of upcycled products as their unique selling proposition ([46]). This is an important contribution, because it also extends to recycling and provides marketers of upcycled and recycled goods with actionable techniques to increase customer demand—an effort that is needed to realize the environmental and economic potential of these market practices ([48]). Conceptual Background Repurposed Products and the Salience of Past IdentitiesUpcycling is a sustainable production mode that prolongs the life of old objects by creatively reusing and reshaping them into new products ([13]; [85]). This repurposing practice allows brands to tap into new markets and generate value from what otherwise might be waste ([12]; [30]; [88]).Upcycling shares this benefit with other sustainable practices of product reuse, such as secondhand products ([ 2]; [45]; [46]), vintage products ([20]; [82]), or social recycling ([22]). However, these practices amount to the simple reuse of the same product by a different owner. In contrast, upcycling entails repurposing old products and results in a new product. It is thus similar to recycling, wherein the value is in old materials being transformed by breaking them down into raw materials before turning them into new products again ([12]; [77]; [84]). Both upcycling and recycling involve the repurposing of old products and entail a true and substantive transformation, in which the nature of the outcome product differs from the nature of its discarded source product.As a result of this transformation, repurposed products have two differing identities: a past identity, which is derived from the form and functionality of the source product, and a present identity, which captures the product's current and mostly different form and functionality. While marketers can focus on the upcycled product's benefits and emphasize elements of its present identity, they can also highlight the product's now dysfunctional past and draw customers' attention to the old or waste materials that compose the product. We call this strategy of alerting customers to the repurposed product's past identity ""past identity salience."" For example, an ad for a wallet made out of old mosquito nets could either not mention this past or explicitly state that it is made from mosquito nets, which is what some upcycling brands do. For example, the luxury bag brand Elvis & Kresse (www.elvisandkresse.com) prominently references to the past identities of its products in its communications, and the Swiss brand Freitag leverages the fact that its bags and accessories are made from truck tarps (www.freitag.ch). The Berlin-based store Upcycling Deluxe even enables its customers to search for products on the basis of what they used to be (www.upcycling-deluxe.com). Recycling brands, in contrast, frequently draw attention to the recycled nature of their products but do not disclose their specific past identities. It is still unclear whether the demand for repurposed products benefits or suffers from a strategy of ""past identity salience.""Several findings actually discourage highlighting repurposed products' past identities. Many customers are skeptical about purchasing used goods ([41]), and they can be sensitive to the physical distortion of a product, which makes them dispose of it more quickly ([77]). Indeed, upcycled products often show traces of wear and tear from their original purpose, which makes customers aware that they are not the first person to interact with the product. Drawing attention to the product's past identity may thus elicit processes of contagion that prevent customers from opting for a product contaminated by other people ([ 5]; [56])—a danger that has been observed in the context of product reuse ([45]) and could extend to repurposing.However, we suggest that it does not, and that repurposed products escape the stigma of the past because they have effectively been transformed into a new product (see [86]), who find that thoughts of transformation trigger recycling). Through this transformation, a salient past identity not only fails to harm demand but, on the contrary, fuels demand, and we propose that this is because past identity salience draws attention to the product's special story. Repurposed products can serve as a prime example of how past identity salience can trigger the persuasive story of a product's biographical transformation. Past Identity Salience as a Story CueThis argument is new to the storytelling literature in marketing. To support it, we first need to address the question ""What is a story?"" Essentially, a story is a linear temporal sequence of causally related events ([27], [28]). It is a chronological description of which events occurred and how they are connected. Another term consumer researchers have used to describe this is ""narrative"" ([ 3]; [27], [28]). Note, however, that other literature has distinguished between these terms in that ""story"" refers to a chronological chain of events and ""narrative"" to their causal factors ([68]; [73]).Chronology and causality are the central structural characteristics that enable narrative thinking ([19]; [27], [28]; [73]). Chronology refers to the temporal sequence or episodes of events ([65]) and to the fact that stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end ([28]; [74]). Causality is defined as the causal connections or relationships between story elements ([27]) that enable customers to assign meaning to a narrative. Rather than causality, some authors use the term ""plot,"" which refers to the theme of a story and imbues story events with meaning ([65]). Stories can feature any number of specific story elements, which are woven together in a plot. Several typologies have been offered to explain the plots of stories throughout history (e.g., [ 9]; [16]; [76]). Although plots differ, a prototypical narrative features a protagonist who is the main character of the story ([65]), such as Cinderella, who participates in story events ([19]). Notably, the mere presence of a main character can serve as a means to provide causality ([19]; [79]).Humans have been attuned to stories and narrative thinking since the dawn of humankind and stories wield considerable power over people ([15]). They are able to demonstrate, communicate, and persuade ([27], [26]). The marketing literature has been well aware of stories' ability to fuel demand ([79]; [83]; [87]), and storytelling is a common marketing practice ([71]; [80]). Marketers tell brand stories ([71]) and stories in which products affect consumers ([49]; [83]), and artists tell stories that feature products or brands as contextual elements or accessories, as in the case of product placement ([44]; [70]). In most of these stories, the product is not the main protagonist, and all of them are clearly recognizable as fully fledged stories that someone tells.Advancing current theorizing, we suggest adding the product's own biographical story to marketers' storytelling toolbox. Moreover, we suggest that marketers can trigger these stories without spelling them out. Simply making the product's past identity salient, as we propose, can induce customers to infer a repurposed product's biographical story and in turn increase demand for the storied product.But how can customers comprehend such stories when an ad features no more than the product and a reference to its past identity? The answer lies in the fact that humans are uniquely attuned to engage in narrative thinking and discern, self-tell, and appreciate a good story ([ 3]; [27]). Moreover, even simple past identity appeals map onto the key structural story characteristics of chronology and causality. As to chronology, a product's past identity is an episode in its life that chronologically precedes its present identity. Making the past identity salient thus ensures that multiple chronologically ordered episodes in the product's life become salient. As to causality, salience of the product's past and present identities implies their causal connection. The repurposed product is the protagonist that ensures causality through its implied identity transformation.Transformational stories are historically one of the most popular forms of story ([16]; [67]). They involve a change in identity as part of the protagonist's biography. Also known as metamorphosis ([76]), this type of plot involves a temporally bounded event (i.e., the transformation) wherein the protagonist changes from one permanent state to a new permanent state without the disappearance of the protagonist from the story ([40]). Metamorphosis plots are present throughout history ([33]), ranging from stories from antiquity (e.g., Ovid's Metamorphoses), to more recent novels (e.g., Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis), fairy tales (e.g., Cinderella), and popular culture (e.g., The Incredible Hulk, The Matrix). Notably, it also extends to the biographical stories of repurposed goods, which transform from being a depreciated product on the verge of the waste-bin to a storied new object with multiple identities.Transformational stories are particularly powerful in terms of inducing narrative thoughts. They only need what narratologists term a ""minimal narrative"" to unfold in people's minds. A minimal narrative consists of identical entities that are present in two temporally and qualitatively distinct states ([66]). The essence of minimal narratives is time change and, often, transformation ([54]). In our research, the minimal narrative consists of the protagonist in time 1 (the salience of the product's past identity) and the transformed protagonist in time 2 (the upcycled or recycled present product identity). Minimal narratives are more than a mere ordered sequence of events because of their overall meaning ([54]), which unfolds in perceivers' minds.We propose that customers will infer a repurposed product's story when its past is salient because this salience allows for an awareness of the plot (i.e., how the different identities are connected via the transformation). To attain that meaning, customers need to engage in inferential processing. Inferencing forms the narrative linkages that empower minimal narratives (past identity, present identity). To engage in inferential processing, individuals need to draw on their personal knowledge and imagination. In a dynamic process, individuals interact with the presented story elements, infer missing information, and include past information to disambiguate stories ([32]; [42]). Research in psychology and consumer research shows that humans are genuinely prone to take agency and engage in inferencing and using their imagination to generate story causality ([27]; [35]; [79]) and to thus complete or comprehend a story that is not fully spelled out.A plot of transformation provides a particularly rich resource for inferential narrative processing. The multiple identities and the metamorphosis itself allow for multifaceted interpretations ([32]; [42]) and provide perceivers with a wide projection; inferencing; and, thus, storytelling space. We therefore expect that a salient cue for a repurposed product's past identity will suffice to induce perceivers to infer its biographical story of transformation. Specialness as a MechanismWhy would people demand a product that holds a story of having been waste more than a product that does not? We propose that storied products cause higher demand because they imbue customers with felt specialness—that is, the belief that they will feel more special as a result of acquiring and utilizing a product that holds a story.To understand how stories can evoke a sense of specialness in people, it is important to understand the ways in which stories affect people ([15]; [27]; [49]). On the one hand, stories focus them on the narrative rather than on rational arguments ([49]), potentially even transporting (i.e., absorbing) recipients into a story ([36]; [79]). However, for this to happen, people must experience the pathos of a dramatic story ([64]) and feel empathy for story characters ([79]). This tends to necessitate the act of telling a fully-fledged story to passive recipients. The minimal narrative provided by quick exposure to an ad including past identity cues is unlikely to allow for either of these experiences.On the other hand, and largely fueled by inferential processes, stories help people in their sensemaking process ([87]). This mechanism is well-suited to explain the appeal triggered by minimal narratives. People's narrative thoughts help shape their perceptions of the story's protagonist and its meanings ([27]). When stories are self-inferred, they are personal to the individual ([74]; [83]) and can evoke diverse special and individual meanings ([57]; [69]). For example, if a customer sees an ad for a wallet made from an old mosquito net, they might draw on their own associations and think of the lives the net has saved or connect it with their own personal travels. These self-inferred, special meanings help decommodify the object ([25]; [46]).Simply ""having"" a story suffices for the protagonist to become more special. Cinderella, for example, is a special princess thanks to her story of transformation (see [31] for how biographical transformations affect the appreciation of the ""transformer""). Like Cinderella, repurposed products are the protagonist in a transformational story that imbues them with a unique biographical history, and objects with such a story are likely to be perceived as special ([46]), even by young children ([62]).Importantly, the meanings of objects tend to transfer to those who acquire and utilize them ([52]) and can help individuals in their identity work, a process that often motivates the decision of whether to acquire an object ([ 4]; [ 7]; [14]). Storied—and thus, special—objects have the power to make individuals feel special about themselves. Given that objects that promise feelings of specialness are known for being high in demand ([ 8]; [38]), storied objects are likely to boost demand ([34]; [58]).In summary, we propose that making a repurposed product's past identity salient alludes to the minimal narrative of its transformational story. This invites customers to engage in narrative thinking and allows them to infer an individualized and special version of the product's story. Perceiving the product as storied, in turn, enables customers to feel special with the product, which eventually triggers demand. Figure 1 provides an overview of the propositions made.Graph: Figure 1. Conceptual model. Summary of StudiesWe test our propositions in seven studies. Studies 1a, 1b, and 2 provide evidence for the effect of past identity salience on real-world product demand. Studies 1a and 1b investigate this in actual Facebook campaigns. Study 2 examines sales data for an experimental upcycling pop-up store. Studies 3, 4, and 6 demonstrate that past identity salience increases demand because the product's biographical story affords people with specialness and generalizes our findings to different types of products and past identities as well as the various claims that make these identities salient.We also provide evidence of the limits of past identity salience. Marketer-crafted allusions to a product's past identity are not the only means through which individuals may infer a product's biographical story. Products with an easily discernible past identity, such as a bag sewn out of highly visible candy wrappers, already provide all the cues needed for the story to unfold in a customer's mind. We thus do not expect additional appeals to a product's past identity to increase demand when the past identity is already salient. Study 5 demonstrates that visual discernibility of a product's past identity acts as a moderator.Given that any biographical transformation requires a past identity, we also do not expect results to generalize to genuinely new products. Study 6 thus compares different production modes and shows that our effect is specific to repurposed products. In particular, it extends our findings to the more prevalent market practice of recycling and demonstrates that they do not generalize to conventional modes of production.Finally, we address several alternative explanations across studies. Study 3 rules out the possibility that the effects are driven by increased perceptions of environmental friendliness. Study 4 shows that results are not a manifestation of a handmade effect, and Study 6 addresses the possibility of other plausible confounds (perceived originality, authenticity, surprise; see also the Study 2 posttest in the Web Appendix). All stimuli (Web Appendix W1), additional analyses (Web Appendix W2), supplementary studies (Web Appendix W3), and replication studies (Web Appendix W4) are included in the Web Appendix. Studies 1a and 1b: Real Campaigns and Online ResponsesIn Study 1, we use two online field experiments to examine how people respond to Facebook ads that make the past identities of upcycled products salient. In Study 1a, we examine how these ads affect Facebook page likes. In Study 1b, we look at the effects on clicks. Method Participants and procedureTo ensure ecological validity, we teamed up with an upcycling store and jointly created two Facebook ad campaigns. The objective of the first campaign (Study 1a) was to increase the number of likes of the store's Facebook page. The objective of the second campaign (Study 1b) was to drive traffic to an external website featuring an online voucher promotion. Each campaign targeted people between the ages of 18 and 65 years old (Facebook estimated a potential target audience of 1.34 million individuals) living in the store's vicinity. To prevent people from being exposed to both campaigns on the same day, we activated only one at a time for seven days and six days, respectively. StimuliWe created small rectangular ads that featured different upcycled products from the store: a cake stand made from old pot lids, a vase made from a light bulb, and a pen holder made from used forks (Web Appendix W1). We manipulated past identity salience by stating what the products used to be (""I used to be a...pot lid, light bulb, fork""). The control group read: ""Now I am...a cake stand, a vase, a pen holder."" By using the term ""Now I am,"" it also hinted at a transformation but made the products' present identities salient. MeasuresIn Study 1a, we measured unique and total like rate (the number of page likes the ad generated relative to its unique and total reach). In Study 1b, we measured unique and total click rate (the number of clicks the ad generated relative to its unique and total reach). To make measures comparable and to control for variance in unique reach (total number of unique people who saw the ad) and total reach (total number of times the ad was shown), we used relative measures (i.e., likes/clicks in percentages of reach) in both studies. Results and DiscussionTable 1 presents a summary of campaign statistics and shows ad performance across conditions. Because we only had access to aggregate behavioral data, we conducted two-sample proportions z-tests to determine which ad was relatively more successful.GraphTable 1. Descriptives of Appeal Measures by Condition (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2).   Study 1aAs expected, the ad yielded a higher unique (.16% vs..06%; Z = 6.72, p <.001) as well as total like rate (.06% vs..03%; Z = 4.65, p <.001) when the products' past identities were made salient. Study 1bA similar pattern emerged for the promotion campaign. Past identity salience significantly increased unique (.29% vs..26%; Z = 1.91, p =.06) and total (.11% vs..08%; Z = 4.97, p <.001) clicks on the promotion. DiscussionDrawing on ecologically valid experimental field evidence in an online context and featuring a portfolio of different upcycled products, Studies 1a and 1b show that past identity salience can increase demand for products of an upcycling store. Owing to the context in which low levels of engagement are common (for average clickthrough rates, see [17]]), absolute effect sizes were quite small, even though like rates doubled and click rates increased by more than 37%. We designed Study 2 to provide ecologically valid field evidence in a context that allows for more pronounced absolute differences. Study 2: Real Purchases in an Upcycling Pop-Up ShopStudies 1a and 1b measured online interest as a demand proxy. Study 2 extends the inquiry to an experimentally controlled brick-and-mortar context and actual sales data. Method Participants and procedureIn collaboration with two upcycling stores, we set up our own upcycling pop-up store on the campus of a large European university. The assortment included 24 different upcycled products (e.g., bags, wallets, bowls). Items were made from a variety of source products (e.g., mosquito nets, parachutes, bicycle tubes) and priced between €5 and €85. Study participants were all potential customers who passed the shop. The shop was open over six days for five hours each day during the Christmas season in 2017. We hired two sales assistants to run the shop on alternate days. To allow for a constant setup, we provided them with a sales script. We instructed them to be friendly but passive (no sales pitches) and to discuss the product's past identity only when prompted by customers. We also instructed assistants to take notes of all that happened during the day. Stimuli and measuresWe manipulated past identity salience by alternating the marketing materials at the point of sale. These included ( 1) a leaderboard that highlighted the products' past (""We used to be...parachutes, truck tarps, pot lids, etc.""; experimental condition) or present (""We are...bags, wallets, cake stands, etc.""; control condition) identity, ( 2) a corresponding price list with individual price tags and product descriptions, ( 3) product flyers, and ( 4) a promotional poster (Web Appendix W1). We changed conditions on a daily basis.For each day, we used the receipt data to assess the number of purchases, the number of products sold, and total revenue. To account for any effects associated with general customer frequency and engagement, the sales assistants tracked the number of visitors to the shop with a manual clicker, self-assessed the busyness level at the shop site every 30 minutes (1 = ""not very busy,"" and 7 = ""very busy""), and measured conversation time per visitor. Results and Discussion Main resultsAverage busyness at shop site (Msalient = 2.55, SD = 1.17; Mcontrol = 2.77, SD = 1.34; t(58) =.46, p =.65) and conversation time per visitor (Msalient =.56 min, Mcontrol =.50 min; z = 1.09, p =.28) did not differ across conditions. When the past identities were made salient at the point of sale, however, the shop had approximately 60% more visitors (266 vs. 165; Mann–Whitney U-test: z = 1.96, p <.05); triple the amount of purchases (25 vs. 8; z = 1.99, p <.05); four times more products sold (36 vs. 8; z = 1.99, p <.05); and, as a result, more than quadruple the revenue (€572 vs. €127; z = 1.96, p <.05). Moreover, the conversion rate (proportion of visitors making a purchase) was nearly twice as high when the products' past identities were made salient (9.4% vs. 4.8%; z = 1.63, p =.08, Table 1). DiscussionMaking the past identities of the products salient to customers in an actual upcycling store increased demand beyond our expectations and with regard to every single factor that can increase revenue: interest (i.e., visitors), conversion, and sales volume. To explore the underlying dynamics of these effects, we followed up on Study 2 with a posttest (Web Appendix W3), which revealed that our effects are unlikely to have been driven by how interesting, boring, or surprising people perceived the products to be.[ 6] Instead, and in line with our assumptions, people feel more special with the products, find them more appealing, and are more likely to purchase them when products' past identities are made salient. Study 3: Felt Specialness and a Product's Biographical StoryHaving established real-world support for our proposed main effect, Study 3 aims to show that past identity salience affects demand because it increases customers' felt specialness with the product. We proposed that past identity salience would increase felt specialness because it triggers thoughts about the product's biographical story. To test for this, we also qualitatively explore whether past identity salience triggers narrative thoughts—and, if so, what elements of the product's story these thoughts refer to. Finally, we address the alternative explanation of felt environmental friendliness. Repurposing products is a proenvironmental practice. Stressing the product's past identity may thus play into sustainable purchase motives ([60]). We aim to rule out that past identity salience may drive demand because it increases felt environmental friendliness rather than specialness. Method Participants, design, and procedureTwo hundred twenty-four U.S. panelists from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk; 44% female, Mage = 35 years) were instructed to evaluate a backpack upcycled from an old airbag in a one-factor (past identity: salient vs. control) between-subjects experiment. We manipulated past identity salience as in prior studies (see Web Appendix W1) and informed all participants that the backpack was upcycled. Participants in both conditions thus rationally knew that the product had a past identity, but this was made salient and concrete in only one condition. MeasuresAs proxies of demand, we first assessed the backpack's appeal (""How would you evaluate this product?"" 1 = ""unappealing/don't like it at all,"" and 7 = ""appealing/like it a lot""; α =.95) and participants' purchase intention (""Would you buy this product?"" 1 = ""No, definitely not,"" and 7 = ""Yes, definitely""). We measured felt specialness as the focal process variable (three items adapted from [53]]): ""How special/unique/recognized would you feel with this product?"" 1 = ""not at all,"" and 7 = ""very""; α =.91) and felt environmentalism as an alternative process (three similar items: ""How sustainable/environmentally conscious/environmentally friendly would you feel with this product?"" 1 = ""Not at all,"" and 7 = ""Very""; α =.93). To explore whether an appeal to the past identity would trigger narrative thoughts, we asked participants to describe what they thought was special about the product in an open-ended question. Finally, we asked whether they took the study seriously and answered conscientiously. Two participants who had indicated that they did not were excluded from further analyses. Results and Discussion Product demandIn line with previous results, past identity salience increased product demand. In particular, participants perceived the backpack as more appealing (Msalient = 4.80, SD = 1.84; Mcontrol = 4.04, SD = 1.94; t(220) = 3.01, p <.01) and were more likely to purchase it (Msalient = 4.17, SD = 2.00; Mcontrol = 3.43, SD = 2.07; t(220) = 2.70, p <.01) when its past identity as an old airbag was made salient. Process variablesParticipants also perceived the backpack as more specialness-affording (Msalient = 4.34, SD = 1.68; Mcontrol = 3.82, SD = 1.81; t(220) = 2.22, p <.05) and felt more environmentally friendly with the backpack (Msalient = 5.37, SD = 1.33; Mcontrol = 4.29, SD = 1.70; t(220) = 5.28, p <.001) when its past identity was made salient. Mediation analysesTo test for the proposed effect of past identity salience on demand through specialness, we conducted two bootstrap mediation analyses (Model 4, [39]). We entered past identity salience as the independent variable (0 = control, 1 = salient), felt specialness as the mediator, and the respective demand variables as dependent measures. Because past identity salience also affected how environmentally friendly people felt, we included it as an alternative mediator. We found an indirect effect of past identity salience on product appeal (indirect effect =.40; 95% confidence interval [CI95] = [.05,.79]) and purchase intention (indirect effect =.44; CI95 = [.06,.86]) through felt specialness. Felt environmentalism did not mediate the effect on appeal (indirect effect = −.02; CI95 = [−.23,.20]) or purchase intention (indirect effect =.002; CI95 = [−.19,.20]). It can thus be ruled out as an alternative process. Type of thoughts triggeredFinally, we analyzed the open-ended answers to explore differences in narrative thinking across conditions. All answers were coded in terms of whether or not they signaled narrative thinking and in terms of their content elements. Thoughts that hinted at chronology and causality, the central structural characteristic of narrative thinking, were coded as narrative, whereas other thoughts were coded as descriptive. As to the content elements, eight recurring themes emerged. Three narrative thought topics focused on different story elements. The respective codes are past identity, in which the prior life of the product was prominent; metamorphosis, in which the product's transformation was prominent; and other biographical elements, in which chronology and causality of the product's story were present but neither could be clearly identified as central. The five descriptive thought topics comprise type of material, production mode, environmental aspects, other product attributes, and product evaluations (for descriptions and examples, see Table 2). Two independent raters who were blind to the condition coded responses with regard to the presence of each of these codes. More than one code could be assigned to one response, and remaining disagreements were resolved through discussion (interrater reliability: all κs >.61).GraphTable 2. Study 3: Thoughts and Themes Associated with Product Specialness by Condition.  1 a Numbers in brackets refer to participant numbers.Table 2 shows the relative prevalence of codes across conditions. Despite the fact that all participants knew that the backpack had a history, narrative thoughts were more pronounced when the ad made the product's past salient. Participants in the past identity salience condition more often reported narrative thoughts (69.6%) than those in the control condition (2.8%; χ2 = 105.53, p <.001). In particular, they more often referred to the product's past identity (66.1% vs. 1.9%; χ2 = 100.30, p <.001), its metamorphosis (50.4% vs..9%; χ2 = 69.60, p <.001), and other biographical story elements (17.4% vs..9%; χ2 = 17.53, p <.001). In addition, descriptive thoughts about the production mode became more prevalent (34.8% vs. 15.9%; χ2 = 10.37, p <.01) when the past life of the product was made salient. In contrast, descriptive thoughts of general product attributes (37.4% vs. 61.7%; χ2 = 13.09, p <.001) and evaluations (21.7% vs. 35.5%; χ2 = 5.18, p <.05) were more prevalent in the control condition. Thoughts about the product's material (19.1% vs. 18.7%; χ2 =.01, p =.93) or its environmental aspects (7.8% vs. 4.7%; χ2 =.93, p =.33) were equally prevalent across conditions. DiscussionStudy 3 replicates the effect of past identity salience on product demand in a controlled setting and supports our proposed account. Making the past identity of an upcycled product salient boosted its specialness-affording potential, which, in turn, increased product appeal and purchase intention. Although past identity salience also affected how environmentally friendly people felt with the product, environmental friendliness did not mediate the effect.[ 7] In addition, Study 3 provides qualitative insights into why customers feel more special once the past identity of a repurposed product is made salient. Past identity salience appears to trigger the product's story and brings to mind additional narrative thoughts that relate in particular to the product's past identity and metamorphosis while decreasing evaluative descriptions and focus on other attributes such as design or weight. Study 4: Testing the Full ProcessStudy 4 provides additional evidence about the proposed process. It tests whether past identity salience enhances people's perceptions of the product as storied, which in turn induces felt specialness and demand (see Figure 1). To corroborate the role of felt specialness as a driver of demand, we not only measured felt specialness but also tried to moderate it. If felt specialness drives the effect, then this route should be less pronounced for those who feel very special already. In addition, Study 4 ensures robustness of the results by extending the inquiry to minimal appeals (i.e., simple ""made from"" claims that neither spell out the story directly nor depict the past identity) and to a new product category and different source product (i.e., a wooden table made from a pallet). Finally, it also addresses another viable alternative explanation: it is possible that highlighting the past identity of a product induces people to think that the product is handmade, a product characteristic that is known to increase product attractiveness ([29]). Method Participants, design, procedure, and measuresA total of 98 MTurk workers (41% female; Mage = 37 years) were randomly assigned to one of two ads that promoted a wooden table (Web Appendix W1). In the past identity salience condition, the ad read, ""I was made from an old pallet""; in the control condition it read, ""I was made for dining."" Prior to ad exposure, we assessed baseline feelings of personal specialness with the same three items used to capture product-specific felt specialness (""In general, how special/unique/recognized by others do you feel?"" 1 = ""not at all,"" and 7 = ""very""; α =.86). After ad exposure, we measured product appeal (α =.93) and purchase intention as in Study 3. To assess whether past identity salience triggers narrative thoughts about the product and its biography, we adapted four items from [49] (""The product tells a story,"" ""The product's story has a beginning, a middle and an end,"" ""The product has evolved over time,"" ""The story of the product has a chronological order""; 1 = ""Strongly disagree,"" and 7 = ""Strongly agree""; α =.95). Finally, we measured felt specialness, as in Study 3 (α =.93), and assessed the degree to which participants thought that the product was homemade (""This product looks..."" 1 = ""homemade,"" and 7 = ""made by a company""). Results and Discussion Main effectsWhen the past identity of the wooden table was made salient, participants perceived it as more appealing (Msalient = 5.15, SD = 1.56; Mcontrol = 4.29, SD = 1.69; t(96) = 1.80, p <.05) and were more likely to buy it (Msalient = 5.21, SD = 1.50; Mcontrol = 4.48, SD = 1.70; t(96) = 2.25, p <.05). Past identity salience also increased product story perceptions (Msalient = 5.13, SD = 1.30; Mcontrol = 3.89, SD = 1.95; t(96) = 3.71, p <.001) and made participants feel more special with the product (Msalient = 4.85, SD = 1.49; Mcontrol = 3.90, SD = 2.00; t(96) = 2.66, p <.01). Felt personal specialness prior to ad exposure (Msalient = 5.04, SD = 1.48; Mcontrol = 5.02, SD = 1.37; t(96) =.07, p =.95) and perceptions of the product as handmade (Msalient = 4.32, SD = 2.03; Mcontrol = 4.67, SD = 1.94; t(96) = −.87, p =.39) did not differ across conditions. Note that the latter also did not moderate the effect of past identity salience on demand (see additional analyses in Web Appendix W2). The role of felt specialnessTo corroborate the role of felt specialness, we ran moderated mediation analyses (Model 7, [39]) with past identity salience as the predictor (0 = control, 1 = salient), felt specialness as the mediator, product appeal and purchase intention as the outcome variables, and baseline personal specialness as a continuous moderator (M = 5.03, SD = 1.42). In support of our propositions, felt specialness mediated the effect for people low (−1 SD) and average (mean) in felt personal specialness, but not for people who already felt very special to begin with (+1 SD) (see Table 1 and Web Appendix W2). Sequential mediationWe next tested whether product story perceptions led to an increase in felt specialness and, as a result, in demand. Two bootstrap sequential mediation analyses (Model 6, [39]) with past identity salience as the independent predictor (0 = control, 1 = salient), product story and felt specialness as sequential mediators, and product appeal and purchase intention as outcome variables found evidence for sequential mediation via product story and felt specialness on product appeal (indirect effect =.15, CI95 = [.06,.27]) and on purchase intention (indirect effect =.15; CI95 = [.05,.28]). Notably, both individual indirect effects through product story and felt specialness on demand became nonsignificant (CIs include 0). Moreover, switching the order of the mediators resulted in a nonsignificant mediation (CIs include 0). This supports the proposed sequential mediation chain. DiscussionResults of Study 4 rule out the competing explanation that our effects are due to the handmade effect ([29]) and fully support our proposed process. Even a simple ""made from [past identity]"" claim increased demand, and this was due to the claim imbuing the product with a story, which in turn made customers feel more special with the product. Study 4 thus supports our proposition that a product's past identity holds storytelling potential. It also corroborates the central role of felt specialness as our underlying process. Baseline felt specialness moderated the effect of past identity salience on specialness and, as a result, the indirect effect of past identity salience on demand. Study 5: The Moderating Role of Past Identity DiscernibilityOur findings suggest that past identity salience is effective because it imbues products with a prior life with their specialness-affording biographical story. However, what if the product itself already tells the story (i.e., the past identity is visually discernible and salient in the product)? Our theorizing suggests this to be a relevant boundary condition for the power of ad-induced past-identity salience. In Study 5, we test for this boundary condition. Specifically, we used a vase made from an obviously discernible light bulb and a vase made from a less discernible electric insulator (for a replication across product categories, see Web Appendix W4). We expect our effect to generalize to the insulator vase but to be attenuated for the light bulb vase because its past life is already salient. Method Participants, design, and procedureWe recruited 562 volunteers from a university mailing list who were familiar with upcycling (61% female; Mage = 24 years) to participate in a 2 (past identity: salient vs. control) × 2 (past identity discernibility: subtle vs. discernible) between-subjects experiment. Depending on condition, participants saw an ad that either did or did not highlight the past identity of a vase made either from an easily discernible light bulb or from a less discernible electrical insulator (see Web Appendix W1). MeasuresWe measured product appeal (""How much do you like this vase?"" 1 = ""don't like it at all,"" and 7 = ""like it a lot""), purchase intention (""If you were looking for a vase, would you buy this particular one?"" 1 = ""No, definitely not,"" and 7 = ""Yes, definitely""), and willingness to pay (WTP; ""What is the maximum amount you would pay for this vase?"" open-ended). As a study incentive and a measure of behavioral product demand, participants could choose to win a product of their choice at the end of the study: the promoted upcycled or a conventional vase. Results and Discussion Product appealA two-way analysis of variance on product appeal produced a main effect of past identity salience (F( 1, 558) = 8.19, p <.01) and a main effect of past identity discernibility (F( 1, 558) = 34.60, p <.001) on product appeal. The prior effect is in line with previous results, and the latter is indicative of product differences. Importantly, these effects were qualified by a marginally significant interaction (F( 1, 558) = 3.41, p =.06). Planned contrast comparisons revealed that past identity salience increased appeal when the past identity of the vase was not discernible (Msalient = 4.03, SD = 1.68; Mcontrol = 3.37, SD = 1.60; t(280) = 3.36, p <.01). It did not, however, affect the appeal of the visibly discernible vase (Msalient = 4.59, SD = 1.68; Mcontrol = 4.45, SD = 1.65; t(278) =.71, p =.48). Purchase intentionA two-way analysis of variance again produced a main effect of past identity salience (F( 1, 558) = 10.99, p <.01) and past identity discernibility (F( 1, 558) = 20.56, p <.001), qualified by a marginally significant interaction effect (F( 1, 558) = 3.63, p =.06). Making the past identity salient boosted demand when it was difficult to discern (Msalient = 3.18, SD = 1.74; Mcontrol = 2.46, SD = 1.46; t(280) = 3.78, p <.001) but not when it was visibly discernible (Msalient = 3.55, SD = 1.67; Mcontrol = 3.35, SD = 1.69; t(278) =.98, p =.33). Willingness to payTo assess effects on the highly skewed WTP measure, we built three equally sized groups of amounts that participants were willing to pay for the vase (<€5, €5–€10, ≥€10; Figure 2, Panel A). Chi-square tests per product show that past identity salience led to a significant increase in the number of people who were willing to pay more than €10 (57% vs. 43%; χ2 = 5.53, p =.06) when the past identity was difficult to discern, but this did not affect WTP when the past identity was visible to begin with.Graph: Figure 2. Effects of past identity salience (Study 5). Product choiceFinally, we ran a logistic regression with past identity salience, past identity discernibility, and their interaction term as the predictors, and product choice as the outcome. We found a significant interaction effect (Wald = 3.70, B =.68, p =.05) but found neither a main effect of past identity salience (Wald = 2.24, B = −.82, p =.13) nor a main effect of past identity discernibility (Wald = 1.29, B = −.62, p =.26). Past identity salience increased the choice of the upcycled product when its past identity was hard to discern (χ2 = 4.42, p <.05) but not when it was easily discernible (χ2 =.36, p =.55; Figure 2, Panel B). DiscussionStudy 5 demonstrates that making the past identity salient is effective, particularly when customers cannot easily discern this identity and infer the product's biographical story by simply looking at it.[ 8] When the past identity was discernible, emphasizing it did not boost demand further. To see how this boundary condition can nonetheless be overcome, see Studies 4a and 4b in Web Appendix W3, which also rule out that a salient past identity could be effective simply because it offers more information. Study 6: Reinforcing the Importance of a Prior LifeStudy 5 showed that appeals to a product's prior life primarily work if this prior life is not salient already. Study 6 addresses another managerially relevant boundary condition. So far, we have tested our propositions in the context of upcycled products, which doubtlessly hold prior identities. In Study 6, we thus ask whether the effect is indeed specific to repurposed products (i.e., products with a prior life). To do so, we generalize our inquiry to recycled products, which are also made from products with a prior life, and conventional products, which are made from brand-new raw materials that lack such a prior life. We expect results to generalize to recycled products but not to conventional products. In addition, we control for various alternative accounts. It is plausible that making the past identity of a product salient might simply trigger surprise and perceptions of product originality or authenticity.[ 9] All of these are connected to positive customer responses and have been studied in the context of vintage products, which are—like upcycled and recycled products—characterized by strong past identities (e.g., [20]; [78]; [82]). Moreover, surprise and novelty have been connected to storytelling ([27]). Method Participants, design, and procedureWe used the same backpack as in Study 3 and randomly assigned 163 individuals (57% female; Mage = 32 years) to one of four product ads, which manipulated production mode and thus the backpack's past identity (Web Appendix W1). All conditions featured the same slogan ""I am a trendy backpack."" In the upcycling condition, participants also read, ""In my previous life, I used to be an airbag."" In the recycling condition, they read, ""In my previous life, I used to be old plastic,"" and in the conventional condition, they read, ""In my previous life, I used to be polyester."" Past identity was not made salient in the control condition; it only read, ""I am a trendy backpack."" MeasuresFollowing ad exposure, we first assessed demand variables. Product appeal (α =.94) and purchase intention were measured as in Study 4, and WTP was measured on a slider scale ranging from €0–€200. In addition, we assessed relative purchase intention by asking participants to rank different backpacks according to their purchase likelihood (1 = ""highest"" to 4 = ""lowest"" likelihood). These backpacks included our focal backpack from the ad and three additional backpacks participants had not been exposed to before. To corroborate the process, we also measured perceptions of product story (α =.90) and felt specialness (α =.93) as in Study 4. As a manipulation check, we added three items assessing the degree to which participants perceived that the product had a prior life (i.e., a true past identity; ""The product contains..."" 1 = ""little history/past/identity,"" and 7 = ""a lot of history/ past/identity""; α =.94). Finally, we assessed perceived originality (""This product is novel/original/different""; α =.78), adapted from [47], as well as surprise (""The product surprises me/is unexpected""; α =.91) and authenticity (""The product is authentic/genuine and real""; α =.89) adapted from [43] and [59], all on seven-point scales (1 = ""Strongly disagree,"" and 7 = ""Strongly agree""). Results and DiscussionTable 3 provides means, standard deviations, and pairwise comparisons of all assessed variables by condition. Conditions differ with regard to all assessed variables.GraphTable 3. Study 6: Means Across Conditions (Past Identity Salience of Different Production Modes).  2 Notes: Different superscripts indicate different cell means (p <.05) based on planned contrast comparisons. Manipulation checkIn confirmation of the intended manipulation, we found stronger past identity perceptions in both the upcycling and recycling conditions than in the conventional backpack and control conditions (F( 3, 159) = 33.12, p <.001). Main effectsConditions also significantly differ on product appeal (F( 3, 159) = 7.25, p <.001), purchase intention (F( 3, 159) = 7.41, p <.001), WTP (F( 3, 159) = 3.72, p <.05), relative purchase intention (F( 3, 159) = 4.32, p <.01), product story perceptions (F( 3, 159) = 12.48, p <.001), felt specialness (F( 3, 159) = 24.60, p <.001), product originality (F( 3, 159) = 4.32, p <.01), surprise (F( 3, 159) = 4.32, p <.01), and authenticity (F( 3, 159) = 4.32, p <.01). Compared with the control group, all measures of demand were higher in both the upcycling and recycling conditions but not for the conventional backpack. Likewise, product story perceptions and felt specialness were significantly higher when the product was upcycled or recycled but not when it was conventionally produced. The same significant pattern of results emerged for our alternative processes, perceived originality, surprise, and authenticity. We thus controlled for them in all subsequent analyses. Sequential mediationTo test whether past identity salience affects demand through product story and felt specialness, we ran sequential mediation analyses per demand variable. Production mode served as the multicategorical predictor (Model 6, [39]). We compared all groups in which we had made a past identity salient (upcycling, recycling, conventional) to the control group in which we had not done so. To control for potential confounds, we added our alternative process variables as covariates to the model (Web Appendix W2 provides further analyses ruling out these suggested accounts). We found evidence for a sequential mediation from past identity salience through product story and felt specialness on product appeal in both the upcycling (indirect effect =.09, SE =.05; CI95 = [02,.20]) and the recycling (indirect effect =.14, SE =.07; CI95 = [03,.30]) conditions. For these two production modes, we replicate the significant indirect effects on purchase intention (upcycling: indirect effect =.08, SE =.04, CI95 = [02,.18]; recycling: indirect effect =.13, SE =.06; CI95 = [03,.26]), WTP (upcycling: indirect effect =.74, SE =.43; CI95 = [.03, 1.72]; recycling: indirect effect = 1.21, SE =.58; CI95 = [.27, 2.55]), and relative purchase intention (upcycling: indirect effect = −.02, SE =.02; CI95 = [−.05, −001]; recycling: indirect effect =.−.03, SE =.02; CI95 = [−.08, −.003]). In the conventional product condition, however, neither indirect effect became significant (all CIs included 0). DiscussionStudy 6 extends our findings to a different context and a new product category. It also addresses an important boundary condition. Our effects are specific to products that are—like upcycling—associated with a prior life (i.e., recycled products) but are attenuated for products that carry little past identity in them (i.e., conventional products). Study 6 also rules out important alternative accounts around perceptions of product originality, surprise, and authenticity. While past identity salience boosts all of these factors, it is the story-induced felt specialness that primarily drives demand. General DiscussionIf products could speak, then each product made from repurposed materials would have a rich story to tell: a Cinderella-like story of a change in identity and purpose, from a discarded and useless past identity to a vastly changed and useful new identity as a new product. We show that appealing to the past identity (i.e., a discarded, broken object that is at odds with the product's current functional purpose) fuels demand for upcycled and recycled products. This is because past identity salience draws attention to the product's special story of metamorphosis, which allows customers to feel special themselves. These insights advance our current understanding of customer reactions to goods made from repurposed materials and open the window to a new facet of powerful storytelling in marketing. Theoretical ImplicationsIn this article, we provide novel contributions to the extant literature on storytelling and to the burgeoning literature on upcycling and recycling as two production modes that involve the use of repurposed materials. With regard to the storytelling literature, we show that one salient piece of information, the product's past identity (i.e., the beginning of its biographical story) suffices to trigger the perception of the product as having a story. We observe this regardless of how we worded this information, from the somewhat story-like ""in my previous life I used to be..."" (Study 5) to the less story-like ""I was made from..."" (Study 4), to the purely informative ""upcycled from..."" (Supplementary Study 2, Web Appendix W3).In contrast to prevalent storytelling practices, which focus on stories about product use or storied metaphors of a brand's essence ([21]; [27]), we focused on the story entailed in a product's own biography. We thus extend this literature by highlighting how products can be protagonists in their own life stories. This raises the question of what such product life stories need to look like to persuade. Our evidence suggests that a product's metamorphosis, its transformation from a past identity, plays a crucial role. Metamorphosis or transformations are powerful narratives ([18]; [40]), and it seems that the source or consequence of the transformation is secondary to there being a transformation. Whatever past identity we used (from airbags to insulators) and whatever the transformation (from bags to tables), the results generalized. Just knowing that there has been a different past identity appears to suffice. We argue that it is this knowledge that invites the inference of all elements necessary for narrative thinking ([27]), a sequence of episodes (chronology) that logically build onto each other (causality).Contrary to most current literature, we never actually spelled out the product's story. Instead, we had customers infer the story by using a ""minimal narrative"" of making two different identities of the same product salient ([66]). Our minimal intervention of past identity salience highlights that the mere presence of a story can be persuasive. This adds a novel facet to storytelling in marketing and advances prior literature that suggests that stories work particularly well, if people experience narrative transportation ([26]; [79])—that is, become absorbed in narrated stories (see [21]] and [49]], who also find that stories can persuade without transportation).Why are these minimal stories persuasive? Because customers feel more special with a product that holds a biography (i.e., a story). We consistently found this, even when we controlled for novelty, surprise, authenticity, and originality. A good story increases appreciation for the story character ([ 3]; [61]) and conveys specialness ([52]). Because people want to feel special, the promise of specialness fuels demand ([38] ; [81]). This observation fits with prior insights on the specialness-affording value of object history ([20]; [46]; [82]), but it constitutes a novel insight in the domain of storytelling. Having a story to tell should thus be added among the factors known to make customers feel special (e.g., [ 8]; [38]).The power of the mere presence of a product's biographical story also allows our insights to be positioned with regard to different production modes. On the one side, our results help distinguish upcycling (our key phenomenon) from consumption of secondhand goods and vintage items, in which a product's prior life matters greatly and contagion is an issue ([ 2]; [37]; [45]). In contrast, upcycling encompasses the presence of a radical transformation away from a product's past identity. This transformation eliminates any taint associated with an upcycled product's past, although this past still makes it special. Notably, our findings generalize to recycling, in which products with past identities are broken down prior to being transformed into new products ([55]). A process of transformation thus appears to be a managerially relevant conceptual distinction within market practices that draw on used materials. This insight also aligns well with [86], who find that highlighting a product's transformative potential increases rates of recycling waste materials. Notably, our focus on metamorphosis or transformation also distinguishes upcycling and recycling from conventional production modes that create products from raw materials that are mostly devoid of a prior life and identity (Study 6). Our results suggest that insights from recycling may generalize to upcycling and vice versa. For both practices, marketers would do well to utilize transformational product biographies as their unique selling proposition. This sets a first benchmark for marketers in upcycling and provides a new lens for thinking about recycling. To date, most recycled products stress the environmental benefits rather than the specialness affordance inherent to past identities. More broadly, our results answer calls for marketing research on products created in environmentally friendly ways ([48]) and add to findings that suggest that environmentally friendly options are not necessarily preferred or avoided for their environmental impact ([14]; [50]). We show that these products may be preferred if they afford specialness. Future Research DirectionsHighlighting a novel facet of storytelling within an upcoming mode of production provides substantial scope for future research. On the one hand, there are several open questions with regard to storytelling. One question is whether there are story elements that might be particularly powerful. In Study 3, we found that past identity salience triggered different narrative thoughts. Future research could explore how and whether such differences affect felt specialness and demand. Another open question is whether results would differ if marketers were to narrate the product's biography in full. Would the effect be enhanced because everyone picks up on the story, or would it be reduced because there is less scope for self-inferencing? A related question asks how powerful a product's biographical story would be compared with other stories told in marketing. This is a relevant but tricky question because stories are more than the sum of their elements. We nonetheless explored this in a supplementary study (Supplementary Study 2, Web Appendix W3). An ad for a laptop sleeve either implied its story through its stated past identity (upcycled from an old mosquito net) or narrated a story of its inception (the product creators were inspired by watching a spider web). The respective stories affected demand to the extent to which participants perceived the product to hold a story. Notably, the marketer-narrated story about the design inspiration imbued the product with less of a story and led to a smaller increase in appeal than the self-inferred story triggered by past identity salience. Future research is needed to identify whether the embodiment of a story in the product outperforms narrated stories that are meant to ""rub off"" onto the product.Future research is also needed to ensure that the results are unaffected by the specific sampling frames we used. We tested our predictions across a range of samples from Austria, including Facebook users (Studies 1a–b), passers-by on campus (Study 2), convenience samples (Study 5), and pure student samples (Study 6). In addition, we conducted some studies with U.S.-based MTurk workers (Studies 3 and 4). Future research is needed to ensure that our conclusions extend beyond these populations. In particular, non-Western cultures may be more reluctant to adopt used goods ([89]).Running our own pop-up store, we learned firsthand how different reactions to upcycling can be. Some people appear to be entirely averse to the notion of old source products. Past identity salience may intensify these individuals' aversions, but these individuals might never fall into the target group. This does, however, raise the question of whether brands should highlight the fact that their branded products become repurposed, and whether they should use the same or a different brand for repurposed products.The effects we observed appeared rather robust regarding who makes the product (see follow-up analyses on perceptions as handmade for Study 4, Web Appendix W2) and what the product was made of. We surmise that the metamorphosis removes the potential taint of nearly any past identity, and we find in a supplementary study (Supplementary Study 3, Web Appendix W3) that even the salience of a truly disgusting past identity (dirty mosquito net) did not hurt demand. The appeal of the past identity may nonetheless influence the size of the effect. This speaks to the power of transformations in overcoming issues of contagion and opens up several lines of future inquiry. For example, does the extent to which the past identity becomes transfigured and distorted in the process of upcycling matter ([77])? Do functional source products (e.g., a glass window) result in different responses to hedonic source products (e.g., a decorative glass vase)? Moreover, who reacts most to past identity appeals, and are there people for whom such appeals backfire? Given that we find that demand is driven by felt specialness, it is plausible that customers who are low in power ([23]) or who feel a need for status ([24]; [75]) would react more strongly.The observed power of a prior life may also advance research on other effects attributed to a product's origin or production mode. Storytelling principles might further increase the effectiveness of appeals related to prior users (e.g., [ 6]), brands, and production sites (e.g., [59]) as well as production and design modes (e.g., [29]). Whether results generalize to such diverse aspects of a product's origin is, however, an open question. Prior research has only tended to find positive effects of appeals to a product's origin when the highlighted origin aspect is desirable. This rests on the notion that the essence of what goes into a product persists in the final product. For example, [59] found that products made in a firm's original manufacturing location hold more appeal because they are believed to contain more of the brand's authentic essence. In contrast, we found that past identity appeals work even when they highlight a discarded origin. In this respect, our findings are particularly novel. Practical ImplicationsThe salience of a product's past identity robustly increased demand across a wide variety of contexts (store and product level, online and offline), categories (e.g., wallets, vases, chandeliers), ad appeals, and product origins (e.g., mosquito nets, parachutes, airbags). In a real store (Study 2), revenues more than quadrupled when we made the past identities of products the focal point of our marketing materials. Online (Study 1a), social media likes more than doubled, and in all instances where we expected to find an increase in WTP or choice share, such an increase was found. The upcycled (vs. conventional) alternative was chosen at least 12% more often when the past identity was made salient.Importantly, our results generalized to recycling. When marketing products made from either of those production modes—recycling or upcycling—marketers should appeal to the product's past, even though this past has no bearing on the product's present identity or functionality. Regardless of what source product we used, past identity salience never reduced demand. However, when upcycled products told their story at a glance, simply restating the past identity did not further boost demand. This finding holds two important implications. First, in recycling, products are broken down to their granular structure. The past identities of recycled products are thus never visually discernible, suggesting that the more prevalent practice of recycling may benefit from past identity salience even more consistently than upcycling. This is an important contribution. In line with our market observations, most companies that use recycled materials simply stress their environmental friendliness but do little to highlight the specific source material going into their products.Second, the boundary condition of past identity discernibility (Study 5) may be overcome even for upcycled products. In two additional studies (Supplementary Studies 4a and 4b in Web Appendix W3), we devised ways in which marketers can do so. We found that easily executed visual tweaks that logically reinforce the product's biographical story boosted product demand even when the product's past identity was discernible at first glance. The key appears to lie in storytelling principles. These suggest reinforcing the chronological and causal structure inherent to the product's story ([51]; i.e., feature the past identity first and more prominently than the resulting product).Our implications also extend to the general adoption of the practice of upcycling. Every year, two billion tons of waste go to landfills around the world, posing a continuous threat to the environment, the economy, and society ([77]; [84]). Encouraging upcycling means that product waste will be reduced, resulting in less landfill and incineration, more energy savings, and decreases in industrial emissions ([11]). Upcycling has experienced impressive growth rates ([72]) and allows for a value-adding possibility in companies' own waste management, but it is still a niche phenomenon. Entering this market may be a worthwhile opportunity. Whenever we asked participants to choose between an upcycled product and conventional product, a substantial proportion of people preferred the upcycled option, and our pop-up store sparked interest. The addition of upcycled products to a retailer's portfolio may be an actionable way to attract customers who want to feel special but lack the financial resources for status symbols.Like Cinderella, the life of upcycled products holds the ingredients for the plot of a bestselling story. This article shows that we can learn from this story and that there may be more to storytelling than currently practiced in marketing. Stories truly unfold in customers' minds ([27]; [79]), but to date marketers appear to think that they have to do all the telling. Our results suggest that customers infer stories, even when they only see a single piece of information. Our results also suggest that stories may imbue potential weaknesses in a product's image (such as a useless past identity) with meaning that benefits rather than hurts demand. Customers appear to feel special when they obtain a product that allows them to infer its story. Perhaps it is time to think of marketing as the creation of a projection space for stories that customers tell and help marketers sell. "
2,A Meta-Analysis of When and How Advertising Creativity Works," Although creativity is often considered a key success factor in advertising, the marketing literature lacks a systematic empirical account of when and how advertising creativity works. The authors use a meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on advertising creativity and test different theoretical explanations for its effects. The analysis covers 93 data sets taken from 67 papers that provide 878 effect sizes. The results show robust positive effects but also highlight the importance of considering both originality and appropriateness when investing in advertising creativity. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are stronger for high- (vs. low-) involvement products, and that the effects on ad (but not brand) reactions are marginally stronger for unfamiliar brands. An empirical test of theoretical mechanisms shows that affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly explain these effects, and that originality mainly leads to affect transfer, whereas appropriateness leads to signaling. The authors also call for further research connecting advertising creativity with sales and studying its effects in digital contexts.","Creativity is important in marketing and is often considered to be at the heart of the advertising industry. The importance of creativity is highlighted, for example, in the popularity of industry competitions, such as the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and the growing academic literature on its effects (e.g., [68]; [85]). However, the value of creativity is also subject to longstanding debate ([ 5]; [52]), and recent reports highlight that marketers are increasingly growing skeptical of advertising creativity ([63]; [66]) and decreasing their investments in it ([27]).When and how is advertising creativity most valuable? Marketers wanting to answer these questions will find little guidance in the academic literature. Although the link between advertising expenditure and advertising effects has been consistently supported ([38]; [80]), to date, there is no comprehensive account of advertising creativity and its influence on consumer response. Even [83] failed to account for creativity as a factor in their insightful and influential review of how advertising works.Several factors seem to hold back scholarship in advertising creativity: ( 1) contrasting empirical results on its effects in terms of ad and brand outcomes (e.g., [51]; [77]; [82]), ( 2) disagreements over what creativity is and how it should be assessed (e.g., [60]; [77]), ( 3) limited understanding of moderators of its effect (e.g., [86]), and ( 4) ambiguity about the kind of theories that best explain how creativity works (e.g., [85]; [86]). Given the apparent confusion about what advertising creativity is and when it might benefit a brand, it is not surprising that marketers often make the wrong decisions when investing in advertising creativity ([68]).In this article, we synthesize the fragmented literature on consumer response to advertising creativity. Based on a literature review, we develop a conceptual framework linking advertising creativity to consumer outcome responses in terms of ad, brand, and sales. Through a meta-analysis, we then integrate 878 effect sizes in the first quantitative empirical overview of the literature. Thus, we capture the impact of advertising creativity on 19 different consumer responses taken from 93 data sets in 67 papers. We thereby contribute a comprehensive and empirically grounded account of how and when advertising creativity works, providing researchers with generalized findings that can serve as benchmarks and a common foundation for future studies of this important topic.First, we provide an empirically validated account of how advertising creativity works. The results show robust positive effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses but also inform researchers about the relative importance of various consumer responses to advertising creativity. Overall, effects are stronger for ad rather than brand responses (r =.491 vs..317) and for attitudinal rather than memory outcomes (all below.140). This suggests that the main advantages of advertising creativity are not grabbing attention and making ads memorable but rather the ability to foster positive ad and brand attitudes.Second, we highlight that advertising creativity is different from originality. Effects on consumer response are greater when creativity is measured as a bipartite construct comprising of originality and appropriateness. Effects of originality only on ad and brand attitudes are comparatively small (.362 and.164), suggesting that marketers who view creativity as synonymous with originality will not reap the full benefits of investments in advertising creativity.Third, we show that the different theoretical accounts used in the literature to explain how advertising creativity works are complementary. Although previously considered separately, affect transfer, processing, and signaling provide the best account when considered jointly. The results further show that processing is a key mediator of the effects, whereas originality fosters affect transfer and appropriateness signaling. When marketers invest in bipartite creativity, affect transfer and signaling occur in parallel to processing, which can explain the stronger effects of creativity compared with originality only.Fourth, we find that when the three theoretical accounts are considered jointly, the effects of advertising creativity on brand response are not dependent on ad responses. This is in line with the signaling account of advertising creativity and suggests that to fully understand how advertising creativity works, marketers should assess consumer responses in terms of brand rather than ad outcomes.For managers, the results provide guidance on how, when, and why to invest in advertising creativity. For example, advertising creativity leads to greater ad responses in high (vs. low) involvement communication contexts (.653 vs..340) and (marginally) for unfamiliar (vs. familiar) brands (.577 vs..435). The literature review also highlights the need for more studies on the relationship between advertising creativity and sales, as well as its effects in digital media contexts, two areas that are especially important given the ongoing debate about the value of advertising creativity in contemporary marketing practice. Conceptual FrameworkFigure 1 presents the conceptual framework guiding the meta-analysis. We developed this framework on the basis of a review of the literature on consumer responses to advertising creativity. The framework focuses on consumer responses that have been empirically studied and distinguishes between immediate and outcome responses. The categorization of immediate responses is based on the three main theoretical accounts of how advertising creativity works found in the literature: affect transfer, processing, and signaling (i.e., consumer response in terms of affect, processing, and perceived signals at the time of exposure to creative advertising). The categorization of outcome variables is based on ad and brand responses and characterized in terms of attitudinal or memory responses (i.e., longer-lasting responses related to the ad and brand, such as attitudes, memory effects, and sales). The framework also highlights two moderators of these responses: definitions and assessments of advertising creativity and properties of the communication context (involvement and familiarity).Graph: Figure 1. How and when advertising creativity works: conceptual framework.aNot tested empirically due to lack of data.Whereas research on advertising creativity generally has found positive effects on immediate and outcome responses (for reviews, see [74]] and [77]]), empirical findings suggest that the effects vary between different types of consumer responses. Findings generally show that advertising creativity has benefits in terms of immediate responses, such as attention ([65]; [78]), positive affect ([30]; [86]), and signals, such as perceived sender effort ([19]; [50]), but results are inconsistent regarding when and how this might also lead to outcome responses, such as attitudes and intentions ([61]; [77]) or memory effects ([65]; [82]). Results also varied regarding whether attitude and memory outcomes are affected ([ 4]). In line with the overall literature, we hypothesize that advertising creativity has positive effects on immediate and outcome responses: H1:  Advertising creativity has positive effects on (a) immediate responses and (b) outcome responses.However, from a managerial perspective, understanding whether investments in advertising creativity mainly affect ad rather than brand response, and whether advertising creativity is better at stimulating attitude or memory outcomes, is also important. Given the inconsistencies in the literature, we qualify this hypothesis by asking what type of consumer responses are most affected: RQ1:  Is consumer response stronger for ad versus brand outcomes? RQ2:  Is consumer response stronger for memory versus attitude outcomes? Defining and Measuring Advertising CreativityAs indicated in the introduction, a key challenge in the literature is the different views on advertising creativity. Creativity is a general construct that has been widely researched in fields such as psychology and organizational behavior, as well as in marketing ([37]; [74]). Creativity can be used to describe individuals (e.g., an art director at an advertising agency), processes (e.g., design thinking methods used to brainstorm advertising campaigns), or outputs (e.g., the actual ad executions used in a marketing campaign). In this article, we adopt the output perspective.Drawing on the creativity literature ([ 2]; [33]; [73]), we define advertising creativity as advertising execution(s) that is (are) original and appropriate. This bipartite definition of creativity has been widely adapted in the marketing literature, in which the definition has been applied in advertising ([14]; [41]), new product development ([ 8]; [37]), and consumer behavior ([ 9]; [62]). As argued by [ 2], a bipartite definition of creativity is required, because outputs that are original or unique but carry no use or meaning are perceived as weird or bizarre. However, any judgments of creativity are subjective and likely to vary across context and time. For example, judgments about originality and appropriateness in a work of art differ from the same judgments in an advertising context (even if the actual object being judged is the same). Similarly, judgments of the creativity of the same object can vary over time. In the art domain, for example, there are several artists who are now considered creative but whose art was controversial or even rejected in their time (e.g., Monet, Picasso, Dalí). Such works were initially seen as ""weird"" or ""bizarre,"" mainly because the type of appropriateness expected of them at the time of creation was a literal representation of reality. Thus, these artists were redefined as creative later, when judgment of appropriateness changed.In the advertising context, the best documented dimension of creativity is originality. This dimension has also been referred to as novelty, divergence, unexpectedness, and newness ([42]; [48]; [76]; [78]). Originality has positive effects on consumer responses to advertising, as originality makes advertising more likely to be attended and processed ([65]; [77]). Originality also has a positive effect on consumer response, as people have a predisposition to appreciate divergent stimuli and deem them intrinsically interesting ([86]). Advertising practitioners typically view originality as the most defining aspect of advertising creativity ([48]; [60]), especially when it comes to advertising creativity awards ([15]; [78]). Thus, it is not surprising that many scholars focus primarily or exclusively on originality when assessing advertising creativity ([49]; [65]).When it comes to appropriateness, this dimension complements originality by connecting the advertisement with brand strategy and consumer problem-solving abilities and goals ([ 3]; [25]; [60]; [78]). In the advertising literature, appropriateness is also referred to as relevance and usefulness (and when assessed by practitioners as ""on strategy""; cf. [41]; [74]). Appropriateness as such has received much research attention (often using the term ""relevance""; e.g., [31]). However, in contrast with originality, scholars rarely consider appropriateness to be an indicator of creativity in and of itself. Instead, researchers typically view appropriateness as a prerequisite for advertising to be interesting to its intended audience regardless of its level of creativity.Theoretically, it is clear that creativity is both originality and appropriateness. Some scholars also argue that additional dimensions could be needed to fully understand advertising creativity ([ 3]; [30]). They argue in favor of including a third advertising-specific dimension of creativity—namely, the quality of the ad execution, also referred to as artistry or production ([60]; [78]). In the literature, we distinguish four approaches to empirically assess advertising creativity. First, some studies measure advertising creativity as a holistic perception of the creativity of an ad, typically by using a single item ""creative"" or multiple creativity items that do not refer specifically to different dimensions (e.g., [71]). Second, other studies rely on only one dimension of advertising creativity (typically originality; e.g., [57]). Third, acknowledging the bipartite definition of creativity, some researchers use the interaction between originality and appropriateness as a creativity measure (e.g., [78]). Fourth, acknowledging the multidimensionality of the bipartite definition, some studies rely on measures of both originality and appropriateness ([42]), sometimes combined with one or more additional dimensions related to the production quality or artistic value ([60]; [68]).We argue that researchers who focus on originality only (e.g., [57]; [65]) are likely to get different results from those who study creativity in terms of a bipartite (e.g., [60]; [78]). Although we cannot test the validity of different assessments, we propose that the best measure of advertising creativity should explain more variance in outcome response variables than alternative measures of creativity, leading to stronger effect sizes (for a similar argument, see [23]). The approach that has the highest explanatory value should also be the most managerially relevant. Given that creativity is defined as a combination of originality and appropriateness, we propose that the effect sizes should be stronger when both dimensions are considered and weaker when only originality is used. Thus, H2:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is stronger when creativity is assessed as a bipartite versus as originality only. When Advertising Creativity Works: Contextual ModeratorsAlthough we expect advertising creativity to generally have positive effects on consumer response (H1), we also expect properties of the communication context to moderate these effects. In the literature review, it was apparent that little attention has been paid to such contextual moderators in the existing literature ([86]). However, we identified two theoretically relevant moderators: involvement and familiarity. Both variables have been found to affect consumer response to advertising in general, but of interest here is how they affect consumer responses to advertising creativity. Specifically, the literature suggests that advertising creativity (i.e., a combination of originality and appropriateness) has benefits regardless of the type of processing (peripheral vs. central; e.g., [10]) depending on these moderators. InvolvementConsumers' involvement with advertising reflects their level of interest in brand evaluation in any given context and has been found to moderate the effects of advertising processing and response (e.g., [56]; [59]). Specifically, consumer responses to advertising differ depending on how much effort goes into processing it. For example, high involvement with a product category motivates consumers to pay attention to and actively process advertising. When involvement is low, attention is typically allocated to other things, and consequently, ad processing is limited and utilizes few processing resources and peripheral cues (e.g., [10]; [56]).Although advertising creativity has typically been thought of as an attention-grabbing device (e.g., [65]), implying that it would work best in low-involvement contexts (where it can foster situational involvement; [10]), creativity has been found to have additional processing advantages when it comes to high-involvement contexts ([79]; [86]). In a low-involvement context, any additional processing stimulated by a creative ad is likely to be shallow ([56]; [86]). In a high-involvement context, however, additional processing makes consumers more likely to actively assess the claims. In this context, the combination of originality and appropriateness fosters more open-minded and less defensive processing of claims made (""willingness to delay closure""; [39]; [86]). This means that consumers will be more open to new information about the brand and less likely to use defensive mechanisms when processing advertising messages that are communicated creatively. Whereas advertising creativity in low-involvement contexts stimulates more affective processing, in high-involvement contexts creativity influences affective and cognitive processing ([86]). In both contexts, advertising creativity should have a positive impact on consumer response, but in a high-involvement context, in-depth processing, coupled with the willingness to delay closure, makes the effects stronger. Thus, H3:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is stronger for high-involvement versus low-involvement products. FamiliarityFamiliarity reflects the extent of consumers' direct and indirect experience with a stimulus, such as a product or a brand ([ 1]; [11]). Consumer response to advertising has been found to vary with familiarity ([55]; [75]). Specifically, the effects of advertising are generally stronger for unfamiliar than familiar brands. This effect is due to consumers not being able to draw from previous experiences (neither their own nor the experiences of others) when evaluating unfamiliar brands, which makes advertising more important for these brands. However, advertising for unfamiliar brands wears out faster ([11]). For marketers of unfamiliar brands, this poses a challenge, as they need advertising to build familiarity but also must be careful about how they advertise to avoid negative reactions caused by (too much) repetition.Familiarity has also been found to moderate the effects of advertising creativity in terms of familiarity with the specific ad ([14]; [65]). [14] found that advertising creativity has two main benefits when it comes to repetition: ( 1) it generates more positive effects upon initial exposure, and ( 2) it resists wear-out over multiple exposures. The latter finding is in line with results showing that advertising creativity (in terms of originality) helps draw attention to familiar ads that might otherwise be overlooked due to tedium ([65]). For unfamiliar brands, these advantages are more important ([11]). Overall, this suggests that advertising creativity should be beneficial for unfamiliar and familiar brands, but given its attention-grabbing character ([65]), the immediate wear-in effect that it can generate ([14]), and the higher impact of advertising in general ([55]; [75]), the effects should be stronger for unfamiliar brands. Thus, H4:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is stronger for unfamiliar versus familiar brands. How Advertising Creativity Works: MediatorsIn the literature, scholars have used three main theories to explain the effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses. These accounts focus on different immediate responses as key mediators of the effects of advertising creativity on outcome responses. The affect transfer model focuses on the potential of creativity to evoke positive feelings that spill over into consumer responses to the ad and brand (i.e., regarding ""positive affect"" as a key mediator; [86]). The processing model focuses primarily on the ability of creativity to get consumers interested in the ad and brand (i.e., ""ad processing"" is the key mediator; [78]). The signaling model proposes that creativity works as a marketing signal, directly influencing perceptions about the sender and thus, consumer responses to the brand (i.e., ""perceived sender effort"" is the key mediator; [19]).[ 5] Affect Transfer ModelA common explanation for the effects of advertising creativity is based on affect transfer ([20]; also referred to as affect infusion; [26]). This explanation focuses on the ability of affectively loaded information to transfer into other, more or less unrelated, targets. In the advertising creativity context, the affect transfer model builds on the fact that consumers generally like creative ads ([71]; [77]). Processing creative ads is seen as intrinsically motivating and pleasurable ([71]; [86]), which means that consumers are likely to experience positive affect while exposed to such advertising. This positive affect spills over to the ad and brand, leading them to be evaluated more favorably ([30]; [86]). According to this explanation, the positive effects are driven by creative ads being more enjoyable and liked, and the positive feelings that this stimulates. Although theoretically exceptions might occur, as may be the case for executions of fear appeal advertising that combines originality and appropriateness, the reviewed literature on advertising creativity unanimously provides empirical support for positive reactions to advertising creativity. Thus, H5:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is mediated by positive affect. Processing ModelExplanations of how advertising works often draw on information processing models (e.g., [56]; [59]). Specifically, they explain consumer responses to advertising based on different levels of ad processing. This is also a common explanation for the effects of advertising creativity. Creativity is said to stand out, thus making creative ads more likely to be attended to and processed ([78]; [86]). This means that more creative advertising stimulates more ad processing, resulting in longer exposure and greater attention ([30]; [65]), which has positive effects on consumer outcome response. According to this explanation, the positive effects of creativity are driven by creativity being more interesting and therefore, processed more. Thus, H6:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is mediated by ad processing. Signaling ModelA third explanation for the effects of advertising creativity focuses on creativity as a signal of brand and company ability (e.g., [19]; [50]). This model builds on research on marketing signals ([44]; [46]), showing that certain behaviors on behalf of a firm (e.g., offering long-lasting warranties) can be used to signal unobservable quality to consumers. For example, advertising spending (i.e., monetary investments) has been found to work as a signal of brand quality ([45]; [47]). Similarly, advertising creativity has been found to be perceived by consumers as a signal that the sender has invested effort (in terms of time and money) in their brand ([18]; [19]). Through creative advertising, a brand conveys that it is committed to its advertising and its products, which is interpreted as a signal that positively affects how the brand is perceived and evaluated. According to this explanation, the positive effects of creativity are driven by creativity signaling effort on behalf of the sender, thus affecting the ad and brand positively. In contrast to the other two models, this account considers process reactions to creative advertising to be about the immediate perceptions of the brand rather than the ad. Thus, H7:  The effect of advertising creativity on (a) ad response and (b) brand response is mediated by perceived sender effort. Full ModelAlthough the three theoretical accounts typically have been used in isolation (for an exception, see [86]]), combining the three models should provide a more comprehensive account of how advertising creativity works. Furthermore, the omission of any one of the intermediary effects might lead to the overestimation of the other ([83]). Therefore, H8:  A model of advertising creativity that considers (a) positive affect, (b) ad processing, and (c) perceived sender effort jointly better explains the effects of advertising creativity on ad and brand responses than any of the three models used separately.To test this hypothesis, we propose a full model, which incorporates all three theoretical mechanisms (see Figure 2). Given that the initial models focus on different variables, we propose several additional relationships in the full model. First, ad processing is likely to spur stronger perceptions of sender effort. This is because processing facilitates a more careful understanding of the ad ([77]), which should, in turn, enhance perceptions of sender effort stimulated by advertising creativity. Second, affective responses can influence not only the ad and brand but also perceptions of sender effort. The underlying logic is, again, affect transfer ([86]). Furthermore, affect and processing should be positively related, because feelings ease processing (mood theory), and easy processing is experienced as a good feeling (processing fluency theory).Graph: Figure 2.

Method Data SetFor this meta-analysis, we selected papers that provide estimates of the effects of advertising creativity on various consumer responses. According to our bipartite definition of advertising creativity, advertising creativity comprises originality and appropriateness. To be able to assess the relevance of different assessments of creativity, we included all studies that identify as ""ad* creativity"" studies independent of their definition and operationalization of advertising creativity. This means that we also included all studies that relied on advertising stimuli judged to be creative (even if they did not use the bipartite definition), as well as studies that investigated the two main dimensions of creativity, even if they did not use the term ""creativity"" ([51]).To identify relevant papers, we first referred to review articles that provide an overview of previous research on advertising creativity (e.g., [74]). We applied an ancestry tree search by searching all papers that refer to the review papers that were available in the Web of Science database. Second, we performed a keyword search of electronic databases (e.g., ABI/INFORM, Emerald, Elsevier, EBSCO, and ProQuest Dissertation Publishing) using ""advertising creativity,"" ""ad creativity,"" ""advertisement creativity,"" and ""advertising creative,"" ""ad creative,"" and ""advertisement creative"" as key words, followed by a search with key words that relate to the two main dimensions of advertising creativity (""original*,"" ""novel*,"" ""newn*,"" ""unexpected*,"" ""divergen*,"" ""innovati*,"" ""incongru*,"" ""relevan*,"" ""appropriate*,"" ""useful*,"" and ""meaningful*"" combined with ""advertis*""). The database search was complemented by a search on Google Scholar. Third, we performed a manual search of the journal outlets that turned out to be major sources for articles on advertising creativity. Fourth, once we identified a paper, we examined the references in a search for additional studies. The search period covered all papers (published and unpublished) that were available by December 2018. The retrieval approach was consistent with recommendations in the literature ([35]) and closely followed the steps taken in recent meta-analyses published in marketing ([69]; [88]).After identifying manuscripts for potential inclusion in the data set, we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine which manuscripts to retain. We included all empirical studies that measured or manipulated advertising creativity (as described previously) and provided estimates on its effects on consumer responses. We excluded any manuscripts outside this scope. For instance, we excluded studies that investigated nonconsumer response to creative ads (e.g., advertisers; [84]), or studies on creative media choice, but not creative ads ([16]). We also excluded studies that failed to provide sufficient data for the meta-analysis and for which necessary data could not be retrieved from the authors.To avoid duplications in the data set, a document with original analyses and findings by the same authors (e.g., journal article, working paper, conference paper) is called a ""paper."" In some papers, the authors analyzed more than one distinct data set (e.g., a paper with several experiments), while some data sets were analyzed in more than one paper (e.g., a study that was published as a conference paper and a journal paper). The analysis is based on data sets. Each data set can provide single or multiple effect sizes that refer to the effect of advertising creativity on any consumer response variable. The search resulted in 67 usable papers covering 93 data sets (see Web Appendix Table 1). The sample includes journal articles, book chapters, working papers, unpublished theses, and conference proceedings, thus reducing the risk of a biased representation of the state of research because of the source of publication. The variation of sources is similar, and the number of papers and data sets is higher than in other major meta-analyses in marketing ([12]; [87]). CodingWe categorized the consumer response variables measured in the studies based on the conceptual framework (see Figure 1). Specifically, we classified consumer responses in terms of immediate responses (affect, processing, and signals) and lasting outcomes related to the ad and brand (none of the data sets provided data for sales). The outcome responses were further divided based on attitude and memory responses. In addition, we identified a few consumer responses that did not fit in either category (e.g., actual creativity, brand familiarity, willingness to pay). Because these consumer response variables appeared either in only one or two data sets or in only one paper, we eliminated them from further analysis.[ 6] We did this to ensure a minimum degree of generalizability, because a meta-analysis should provide a high degree of generalization and thus, requires more information than a single manuscript or a single-study manuscript followed by a replication study. This left 878 effect sizes. For an overview of the consumer response variables and categorization scheme, see Table 1.GraphTable 1. Variables Used in the Meta-Analysis.  1 a The moderator variable is measured at the effect-size level, while all other moderators are measured at the data-set level.2 Notes: Intercoder reliability is provided for all high-inference coding with AR = agreement rate and α = Krippendorff's alpha.In terms of creativity moderators, we coded the variables at the effect size level, meaning that multiple effect sizes from one data set can be assigned different codes. Specifically, we coded whether creativity was assessed as originality only, as appropriateness only, as an interaction effect between originality and appropriateness, as a multidimensional concept (including originality, appropriateness, and potentially more dimensions), or as a holistic concept (measured with a single item ""creative"" or corresponding multiple items or manipulated as such; this is the base alternative in the model). As an illustration, [86] presented results based on originality and appropriateness separately, as well as for the interaction between the two allowing us to code three types of measurements for each of the variables studied. Although our main interest is in comparing a bipartite view of advertising creativity with a view of advertising creativity as originality only, this coding process allows a more complete understanding of how different assessments of creativity affect consumer response.In terms of communication context moderators, we dummy coded the variables on the data-set level. Specifically, we coded the data sets 1 if the advertised category was a high-involvement product and if the advertised brand was familiar. In addition, we added three control variables that captured substantial differences between studies and that could be related to the context variables (medium, year, and award). Two authors independently assigned variables in the primary studies to consumer responses and coded the moderators and control variables based on the information available in each study. The agreement rate was above 98% (Krippendorff's alpha =.932), and inconsistencies were resolved by discussion. Effect Size ComputationThe effect size metric selected for the meta-analysis was the correlation coefficient; higher absolute values of the coefficient indicate a stronger influence of advertising creativity on consumer responses. For papers that reported other measures (e.g., Student's t, mean differences), we converted those measures following guidelines for meta-analysis ([53]; [64]).[ 7] We adjusted all correlations for unreliability. When a paper did not report the reliability, or when the paper used a single-item measure, we used the mean reliability for that construct across all studies, following the procedure in previous meta-analyses in marketing (e.g., [43]).We dealt with integrating dependencies between effect sizes using the following approach. When a data set provided findings for different consumer response variables, we treated the findings as independent, because we integrated and analyzed the estimates for each consumer response variable separately. Some data sets reported multiple relevant tests for the same consumer response variable. We accounted for the dependencies of the effect sizes and the nested structure of the meta-analytic data by using a mixed-effects multilevel model ([67]). We estimated the following model: rij=γ00+μ0j+eij, Graph1where i = 1, 2, 3...I effect sizes, j = 1, 2, 3...J data sets. This formula estimates the average effect size γ00, the deviation of the average effect size in a data set from γ00 (μ0j), and the deviation of each effect size in the kth data set from γ00 (eij). The latter two terms have variances that follow a normal distribution and are uncorrelated.To address publication bias, we computed fail-safe Ns ([72]), which represents the number of additional effects with null results needed to render the results for an integrated effect size not statistically significant at p =.05. The fail-safe Ns were calculated for all statistically significant integrated effect sizes (p <.05) using the effect size estimates that were adjusted for measurement error. Furthermore, we provided a homogeneity test as an aid in deciding whether the observed effect sizes were more variable than would be expected from sampling error alone. If they are, there is a strong basis for including moderators. The homogeneity test involves the Q statistic, in which the distribution is similar to a chi-square with K − 1 degrees of freedom ([32]). Moderator AnalysisIf the homogeneity test indicated heterogeneity, we proceeded with a moderator analysis. We added the moderators specified by the hypotheses and the control variables simultaneously to Equation 1 and ran multilevel meta-regression models in hierarchical linear modeling separately for the major outcome variables. The model was a mixed-effects model, because fixed effects for the moderators were considered in addition to random components. We specified the following model: rij=γ00+ γ01×involvementj+γ02×familiarityj+γ04×mediumj+γ05×yearj+γ06×awardj+γ10×originalityij+γ20×appropriatenessij+γ30×interactionij+γ40×multidimensionalityij+γ50×partial correlationij+u0j+eij, Graph2where rij is the ith effect size describing the relationship between advertising creativity and the respective consequence variable reported within the jth data set.Assuring the robustness of the model required a sufficient sample size. The major restriction is often the higher-level sample size, and the literature recommends a sample of around 50 to avoid biased estimates of the second-level standard errors ([54]). Thus, we applied the model only to the outcome variables in the data set with a sufficiently large sample of data sets: Aad and Abrand (43 and 44 data sets, respectively). Structural Model EstimationTo investigate the different processes that explain how advertising creativity works, we developed a correlation matrix including integrated effect sizes of the consumer responses to advertising creativity and added integrated effect sizes for the interrelationships between the consumer response variables. We followed recommendations in the literature about collecting meta-analytic data for the correlation matrix, deciding about sample size, analytical decisions, and reporting ([ 6]). We searched the papers in the meta-analysis for correlations for the interrelationships between consumer response variables. For a construct to be included in such analysis, multiple study effects must relate it to every other construct in the model. Therefore, no additional variables shown in Table 1 could be considered. For example, because we did not find correlations between sender effort and recall or memory measures, the latter could not be included in the model. We found at least three correlations for each relationship, which equals or exceeds the requirements of other meta-analytic correlation matrices found in the literature ([28]). We integrated and adjusted the correlations in the same way as the correlations between advertising creativity and consumer response variables. That is, we first adjusted all correlations for unreliability. We accounted for the dependencies of effect sizes and the nested structure of meta-analytic data by using a mixed-effects multilevel model as described previously ([67]).We then used this correlation matrix (see Web Appendix Table 2) as input in a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the maximum likelihood method. The matrix was based on 449 correlations, and the harmonic mean of the cumulative sample size for each cell equaled 1,293. Each construct was measured with a single indicator in the structural model. We fixed the error variances for these indicators to zero because we had already considered measurement errors when we integrated the effect sizes. We used the harmonic mean of the cumulative sample size underlying each integrated effect size (i.e., effect size cells comprising each entry in the correlation matrix) as the sample size for the analysis. ResultsTable 2 reports the integration of the reliability-corrected correlations between advertising creativity and all consumer response variables.GraphTable 2.

The corrected average correlation coefficients (r) are the sample size-weighted, reliability-corrected estimates of the population correlation coefficients. The fail-safe N indicates the number of nonsignificant, unpublished (or missing) effects that would need to be added to a meta-analysis to reduce an overall statistically significant (p <.05) observed result to nonsignificance.Looking at immediate responses, we found statistically significant effects on affect in terms of positive affect and perceived humor. Interestingly, although positive affect has been studied more, the effects of humor were significantly stronger as indicated by nonoverlapping confidence intervals (95% CI for positive affect [.198,.388] vs. humor [.428,.832]). We also found significant positive effects on processing in terms of attention, interest in the ad, and ad processing, but only a marginal effect on complexity and positive thoughts. The effects on attention, interest in the ad, and ad processing were comparable in size (95% CI for attention [.218,.592], interest in ad [.215,.615], and ad processing [.015,.659]). Furthermore, advertising creativity had statistically significant positive effects on perceived signals: sender effort, brand value/quality, brand trust, and brand credibility. These effects were comparable in terms of size (95% CI for perceived sender effort [.282,.510], value/quality [.171,.407], brand trust [.171,.603], and brand credibility [166,.628]).Turning to outcome responses, advertising creativity had a statistically significant effect on all ad responses: Aad, ad recall, and ad recognition. The strongest and most widely studied effect was that on Aad. In terms of brand responses, the effects followed a similar pattern: Abrand was the most widely studied variable and statistically significantly affected. We also found a statistically significant positive effect on purchase/behavioral intention and brand memory, but not on brand recall or brand recognition. Overall, the pattern of results support H1 by highlighting that advertising creativity has positive effects on consumer reactions in terms of ad and brand. Answering RQ1, we found that the effect on Aad was statistically significantly larger than that on Abrand and purchase intentions (95% CI for Aad [.407,.575] vs. Abrand [.235,.399]) and purchase intention [.225,.387]), and that the effects on ad recall ([.214,.408]) were significantly larger than the effects on brand memory ([.072,.208]). This suggests that ad responses are more affected than brand responses. Related to RQ2, the pattern of results suggests that effects of advertising creativity are stronger for attitudes than for memory. Aad was statistically significantly different from ad recognition (95% CI for Aad [.407,.575] vs. ad recognition [.107,.307]), and marginally different from ad recall ([.214,.408]). Similarly, the effect on Abrand was significantly stronger than the effect on brand memory (95% CI for Abrand [.235,.399] vs. brand memory [.072,.208]).All homogeneity tests (except for brand memory) were statistically significant at p <.05 and showed that the variation in effect sizes cannot be explained by sampling error alone. The fail-safe N indicates that the statistically significant integrated correlations do not suffer from publication bias according to [72] rule of thumb (fail-safe N should be at least 5 times the number of effects plus 10).Table 3 presents the results for the multilevel moderator regression model for the relationship between advertising creativity and Aad and Abrand. To investigate whether the positive effects of advertising creativity depend on the type of assessment used, we examined the moderating effect of creativity assessments. The analysis showed that relying only on originality led to lower effect sizes for Aad and Abrand; thus, H2 was supported. We found a similar pattern for assessments relying on appropriateness only and for interaction effects, although the negative effect was only marginally significant for the latter when it came to Abrand. The findings also showed that multidimensional measures of advertising creativity led to stronger effect sizes for Abrand, but not for Aad. Overall, this pattern of results suggests that assessing advertising creativity only in terms of ( 1) originality, ( 2) appropriateness, or ( 3) an interaction effect between the two will lead to an underestimation of the effects. From a managerial perspective, the result also suggests that a multidimensional view of advertising creativity is the most relevant, as brand responses are more important than ad responses.GraphTable 3. Influence of Moderator Variables on Effect Sizes: Multivariate Meta-Regression Analysis Results (H2–H4).  9 †p <.10.10 *p <.05.11 **p <.01.12 ***p <.001.We then turned to the moderating effect of the communication context. The results showed stronger effects on Aad and Abrand for high-involvement products; thus, H3 was supported. Furthermore, the effects on Aad were marginally stronger for unfamiliar products, but there was no statistically significant difference in terms of Abrand. Thus, H4 was only partially supported. The control variables showed that using a partial correlation coefficient led to smaller effects on Aad. None of the remaining control variables affected Aad. However, the effects on Abrand were higher for audiovisual media (TV/movies) and marginally lower for award-winning ads. We did not find any statistically significant differences in terms of year of study.[ 8]To better understand why advertising creativity has positive effects on consumer responses, we performed a SEM analysis of the different models using the meta-analytic correlation matrix (cf. Web Appendix Table 2). Table 4 presents the results of the SEMs (standardized coefficients and model fit statistics). As we suggested alternative models implying that the relationship between advertising creativity and Aad is mediated by more than one mediating variable, we added a path between advertising creativity and Aad that captured alternative processes to each model. All three individual models showed a very good model fit, and all paths were statistically significant and in line with the suggested effects; thus, H5, H6, and H7 were supported.GraphTable 4. Coefficients and Fit Indices of the Meta-Analytic SEMs (H5–H8).  13 †p <.10.14 *p <.05.15 **p <.01.16 ***p <.001.The model that combines the three individual models showed a comparatively weak fit but was significantly improved by adding the proposed relationships between processing and perceived sender effort and positive affect and perceived sender effort suggested by the full model (Δχ2/d.f. = 96.527/5, p <.001; see Figure 2). To determine whether the full model provided a better explanation than the three parsimonious models that were nested within it, we compared the fit of the full model that was restricted to any of the nested models with the fit of the full model with unrestricted paths. The model fit worsened significantly when it was restricted to the affect transfer model (Δχ2/d.f. = 1,629.935/8, p <.001), the processing model (Δχ2/d.f. = 1,733.093/8, p <.001), or the signaling model (Δχ2/d.f. = 1,528.916/8, p <.001). Thus, the full model provides an explanation that goes beyond the explanatory power of each nested model; H8 was empirically supported. Interestingly, in the full model, the mediating effect of Aad on Abrand dropped from around.5 in the individual models to a marginally significant effect of.078 (Δχ2/d.f. = 96.512/1, p <.001). This suggests that the effect of advertising creativity on brand response is only weakly mediated by ad response, which adds additional insight into RQ1 about the effects of creativity on ad versus brand response.We performed two additional analyses to further explore how well the three models explain the effects of creativity on consumer response. First, we compared how much of the variance in Aad was explained directly by advertising creativity and indirectly by either process suggested by the three individual models (we could not apply this comparison to Abrand, as there was no direct effect of creativity on Abrand in the model). We computed the proportion of mediation as the ratio of indirect to total effect; that is, the indirect path(s) was/were divided by the sum of the direct path and indirect path(s) ([36]). The proportion of mediation via positive affect was 26.8%, via ad processing was 28.3%, and via perceived sender effort was 33.9%. When we tested the mediation paths in the full model against each other by restricting two corresponding paths at a time (see Web Appendix Table 3), we found no differences between the paths from advertising creativity to any of the three mediators (positive affect, ad processing, and sender effort). However, the effect of sender effort on Aad was significantly different and stronger than the effect of either positive affect or ad processing on Aad. The findings indicate that signaling explains more variance in Aad than the two other models, thus providing the strongest explanation for the effect of creativity on Aad of the three models.Second, we compared the theoretical explanation offered by the full model between the two dimensions of creativity by using correlation matrices that considered the variable relationships with either originality or appropriateness instead of creativity (see Web Appendix Table 4). The results showed that the positive effects on ad processing are equally strong for both dimensions. However, affect transfer mainly explains the effects of originality as indicated by the fact that the path from creativity to positive affect was statistically significant for originality, but not for appropriateness. When it comes to signaling, however, appropriateness seems more important, as indicated by the significantly stronger link between creativity and sender effort. Discussion Summary of FindingsIn this article, we offer a comprehensive synthesis of the effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses. The study highlights the importance of advertising creativity by showing robust positive effects on a wide range of immediate and outcome responses. The effects are stronger for ad responses compared with brand responses and for attitudinal compared with memory outcomes. Moderation analyses show that the effects of advertising creativity are weaker when creativity is assessed as originality only, compared with a bipartite comprising originality and appropriateness. This suggests that the effects of advertising creativity go beyond those of originality alone. The results further show that advertising creativity has stronger effects in high-involvement contexts, and that effects on ad response are (marginally) stronger for unfamiliar brands. Furthermore, we find empirical support for all three theoretical accounts (affect transfer, processing, and signaling) used in the literature, but also that a full model (where the three accounts are considered jointly) best explains the effects of advertising creativity on consumer outcome response. In the full model, the effect of the three advertising creativity mediators (positive affect, ad processing, and perceived sender effort) on brand response is only marginally mediated by ad response, suggesting that although ad responses are generally more affected than brand responses, they are not needed for advertising creativity affect brand response. Additional analyses show that affect transfer mainly explains the effects caused by originality and that signaling provides the strongest account of advertising creativity in terms of ad response. Theoretical ImplicationsAlthough marketing researchers and practitioners tend to agree that advertising creativity is important, there are contrasting views on what advertising creativity is, and how and when it can lead to positive outcomes. Through this meta-analysis, we provide a synthesis of the growing, but dispersed, literature on advertising creativity, thus building a common foundation for future studies of this important topic. The results inform about important outcome variables and moderators of advertising creativity effects. The meta-analytic findings can serve as benchmarks for future advertising creativity studies, as well as for studies dealing with other ad execution elements. Future findings can be compared against the meta-analytic results in terms of explained variance as a measure of advertising effectiveness. The results also have several implications for future studies of advertising creativity.First, we offer an empirically validated understanding of how advertising creativity works. The pattern of results suggests that advertising creativity has a role to play in stimulating positive consumer responses that goes beyond being a source of attention. If the attention-grabbing nature of advertising creativity were the key benefit, its effects should be greater for memory rather than attitudinal responses, and in communication contexts where consumers are less likely to attend to and process ads, such as for low-involvement products and for unfamiliar brands ([19]; [65]), which is not in line with the empirical results. Although claims that advertising creativity enables advertising to ""cut through clutter"" and make advertising more memorable ([65]) are true, they risk directing focus away from attitudinal consumer responses, which are more affected. The fact that advertising creativity has stronger effects in high-involvement contexts suggests that processing is important for the effects to occur. It also raises the question of what to expect from advertising creativity in contexts where consumers are unlikely to pay attention to and process ads, such as digital and mobile media. The meta-analysis did not include any such studies, but the results suggest that effects should be weaker in media such as smartphones where focus is very directed at other focal tasks ([58]). At the same time, effects should be stronger for advertising content in own channels and in media where consumers voluntarily seek out advertising ([70]). However, future research is needed to explicitly study the role of advertising creativity in these contexts.Second, we contribute insights into how to define and assess advertising creativity. In line with the creativity literature ([ 2]; [73]), the results indicate that creativity is not just about originality. A bipartite definition and multidimensional assessments of creativity offer better explanations of the effects (for a similar argument, see [ 3] and [60]). This suggests that researchers should be mindful when using the term advertising creativity and restrict it to studies of original and appropriate ads. When studying original advertising only, the term creativity should be avoided. It also suggests that the reliance on advertising awards as an operationalization of advertising creativity is not valid, as such awards tend to focus on originality ([15]; [41]). The fact that empirical studies have found positive effects of original and award-winning ads, however, is reassuring, as the results suggest that, if anything, those studies underestimate the effects.Third, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of how advertising creativity works. The findings show that the different theoretical accounts of advertising creativity available in the literature are complementary, but also that they have different relationships with creativity dimensions. Our meta-analytic path analysis show that originality primarily stimulates affect transfer, whereas appropriateness is more important for signaling. We also find that signaling has the highest explanatory value. Again, this reinforces the notion that a bipartite view of advertising creativity is most relevant, as ads that combine originality with appropriateness allow these mechanisms to work simultaneously, whereas original ads do not. It also suggests that future studies of advertising creativity should include more comprehensive theoretical frameworks than what has previously been the case. Together, these insights offer the basic building blocks for a more complete processing model of advertising creativity called for by [85].Fourth, the finding that the three theoretical mediators of advertising creativity have direct effects on brand response (Abrand) that are only weakly mediated through ad response (Aad) adds further to our understanding of how advertising creativity works.[ 9] It shows that although creativity has stronger effects on ad responses than brand responses, these effects are not necessarily dependent on ad response. Again, this pattern can be understood in terms of the combination of (high) originality and (high) appropriateness in creative ads. In line with [78] finding that originality has advantages in terms of attention and that appropriateness stimulates downstream effects and brand response, advertising creativity allows the two to work in parallel, which also has more direct brand outcomes. This finding is in line with the signaling account of advertising creativity that suggests a more direct effect on the brand. For researchers, it suggests that when studying the effects of advertising creativity, brand (and sales) responses must be included through direct measures rather than relying on Aad or other ad responses as proxies of such effects.Overall, the empirical results provide convincing evidence of the positive effects of advertising creativity on consumer responses and thus highlight the need for marketing scholars to consider not only media investments (ad spend; [38]; [80]) but also creativity investments in models of how advertising work. Managerial ContributionsFor marketers, we contribute a systematic account and empirical evidence of the value of advertising creativity. Specifically, we offer important insights into how, when, and why to invest in advertising creativity. Given the ongoing debate about the value of creativity in advertising ([27]; [66]), this contribution is timely and useful. It also shows no evidence of advertising creativity becoming less (or more) effective over time.When it comes to how to invest, [68] found that many marketers make suboptimal decisions regarding investments in advertising creativity. We suggest that a tendency to focus on originality might be the root of this problem. Creativity is more than originality, and by incorporating appropriateness consumer response will be more positive. To achieve this, marketers must find ways to assess advertising creativity. This is easier said than done, given that creativity judgments are subjective and vary across context and time. We find that award-winning ads lead to marginally weaker brand response, suggesting that consumer rather than professional judgments should be used. This supports [ 3] argument that marketers should involve consumers more in advertising development. Whereas there is a growing literature focusing on consumers as cocreators of advertising ([17]; [81]), consumers could also be engaged as prejudges of advertising. A post hoc analysis of the role of ad judges provided additional support for this notion. Specifically, we coded a variable that distinguished between ads that were judged to be creative by either consumers, by experts, or selected from award shows. As some studies did not provide details on ad judges, we first ran analysis of variance models for a combination of all three outcome responses (Aad, Abrand, and intentions) to ensure sufficiently large sample sizes. We found significant effects (F( 2, 351) = 4.931, p =.008) on outcome response. The effects were stronger when consumers judged advertising creativity (.373) compared with experts (.300) or award shows (.193). When we analyzed the three responses separately, the effect held for Abrand and intentions, but not for Aad. As brand outcomes are more valuable for marketers, this reinforces the potential in allowing consumers to (pre)judge advertising creativity.When it comes to when to invest, the results suggest that advertising creativity has positive effects in general but also that the effects are stronger for attitudinal rather than memory response and marginally stronger in audiovisual media (TV/movies vs. print/outdoor). Furthermore, the effects are stronger for high-involvement contexts. For marketers, this challenges the established view of advertising as a tool for gaining attention and suggests that creativity is especially valuable in contexts where consumers are likely to process advertising. Although we studied product involvement, this logic should also hold for media context involvement, meaning that creativity is more likely to work in situations where more focused ad processing occurs. Thus, advertising creativity should be more important for media contexts in which consumers voluntarily direct their attention to, or are forced to focus directly on, advertising than in in media contexts that rely on incidental and divided attention (see also [17]; [70]).We also find that advertising creativity has marginally stronger effects for unfamiliar compared with familiar brands. However, this effect is related only to ad rather than brand response. As suggested by [11], ad response is a strong indicator of brand response for unfamiliar brands (as consumers have little other information on which to base evaluations), suggesting that this finding is still managerially important. By investing in advertising creativity, such brands can increase the value of their advertising to consumers (""advertising equity""; [70]). Taken together, this suggests that advertising creativity is especially valuable when establishing a new brand in the market.When it comes to why advertising creativity works, the mechanisms underlying its positive effects are more profound than many marketers might think. An in-depth understanding of how affect transfer, processing, and signaling jointly contribute to brand response help make investments in advertising creativity less risky ([85]). Although marketers who focus on originality can expect positive effects due to affect transfer, they will miss out on the potential effects of signaling and appropriateness. By investing in bipartite advertising creativity, marketers can increase the chances of their ads being liked, processed, and interpreted as signals of what the brand has to offer. It also means that there is little risk that positive effects will be for ad response only.From a managerial perspective, the effects of signaling are especially important to consider, as they offer the strongest explanation for the effects on ad response and because appropriateness is especially important in high-involvement and low-familiarity contexts, where advertising creativity also has the strongest effects. It suggests that advertisements can produce effects by way of the signals they send rather than the specific messages they convey. Signals are especially important in situations where there is information asymmetry between marketers and their customers ([13]; [46]). This is arguably the case for unfamiliar brands and high-involvement products as well as in other situations where the decision-making process is complex, such as in business-to-business, business-to-government, and recruitment contexts ([13]; [18]). In fact, recent research suggests that the effect of advertising signals extends beyond consumers to other stakeholders, such as employees and investors ([18]), though this is beyond the scope of the present study. Limitations and Further ResearchGiven the nature of a meta-analysis, we could study only consumer responses that previous researchers had investigated. This means, for example, that we could not consider potential negative effects of creativity on, for example, confusion, negative affect, and fear appeals. However, we found a marginally significant negative effect of complexity, suggesting that the potential downsides of creativity warrant further investigation.Similarly, the literature review revealed a lack of studies on the effects of advertising creativity on sales (for an exception, see [68]) and the effects of advertising creativity in digital contexts, such as the effects of advertising creativity on social media influencer engagement ([34]). Future studies are needed to explore how advertising creativity works in those contexts. Studies linking the effects of advertising creativity to behavioral measures, such as brand choice or sales, seem especially important. This could be done by combining quantitative (advertising spend) and qualitative (advertising creativity) assessments of advertising investments with behavioral outcomes, for example, adding advertising creativity in marketing-mix models or adding sales as a dependent variable in experimental studies. In such efforts, additional moderators, such as clutter ([65]) and repetition ([14]), should also be considered.As another limitation, the present study focused on consumer responses to advertising creativity only. There are several related issues in the literature that could contribute to our understanding of advertising creativity. For example, there is a vast literature on creative processes in agencies that foster creativity in advertising ([29]; [40]), and synthesizing this literature should bring additional insights to marketers. Relatedly, there should be room to further integrate the literature on advertising creativity with creativity research focusing on other marketing contexts ([ 8]; [21]) to allow for a more complete understanding of how creativity works in marketing more broadly. It is our hope that this article can contribute to this development. "
